Revenue growth also reflected continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said",,"Chairman Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries, Reliance Jio Infocomm ltd, Reliance Retail, Results",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/ten-takeawaysreliance-results-as-conglomerate-posts-record-q2-for-consumer-businesses_16668391.html,"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries on October 21 reported a record performance in consumer businesses which continued to scale new milestones every quarter, but its performance&nbsp;in the O2C (oil-to-chemical) business reflected subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products.  Here are 10 key highlights from the quarterly earnings scorecard:  1) Profit  Reliance registered a 0.2 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 15,512 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, with cash profit growing 15.4 percent to Rs 27,614 crore for the same period.  Its other income during the quarter fell by 16.8 percent to Rs 3,514 crore YoY.  2) Topline  The gross revenue for the quarter at Rs 2.53 lakh crore was higher by 32.4 percent compared to year-ago period, while revenue from operations increased by 33.7 percent to Rs 2.32 lakh crore.  The increase of 32.4 percent in gross revenue was driven by higher realization in O2C business with sharp increase in energy prices. Revenue growth also reflects continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said.

EBITDA including the impact of special additional excise duty stood at Rs 34,663 crore, up 14.5 percent YoY.  The growth in EBITDA was driven by positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies in retail segment, higher gas price realization with increase in ceiling price, increase in ARPU and customer engagement in digital services segment.  4) Finance Cost  Reliance said its finance cost increased by 19.2 percent to Rs 4,554 crore during the quarter YoY, due to higher loan balances and tightening of monetary policy by central banks.  5) Debts and Cash  It has an outstanding debt as of September 2022 of Rs 2.94 lakh crore or $36.2 billion, while the cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 2.01 lakh crore ($24.8 billion).  The capital expenditure for the quarter was Rs 32,534 crore and additionally, it incurred expenses of Rs 88,078 crore for acquisition of spectrum by RJIL.

Revenue from operations for the quarter at Rs 24,275 crore for the quarter increased by 22.7 percent year-on-year aided by increase in average revenue per user (ARPU).  ARPU during the quarter at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month grew at a healthy pace of 23.5 percent growth on YoY basis, while the data traffic increased by 22.7 percent YoY to 28.2 billion GB during the quarter.  Total customer base of Jio as of September FY23 stood at 427.6 million.  &amp;quot;We saw consistent net subscriber additions and higher engagement in digital services segment,&amp;quot; said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director.  Jio Platforms registered a massive 29.2 percent year-on-year growth in EBITDA at Rs 12,011 crore driven by strong revenue growth and margin improvement. The margin at 49.5 percent expanded by 250 bps YoY due to increase in ARPU, which partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs.  7) Reliance Retail  Reliance Retail delivered record revenue and profits during the quarter led by broad-based growth across all consumer baskets, with revenue growing a massive 44.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 57,694 crore and profit increasing 36 percent YoY to Rs 2,305 crore.  The business expanded its physical store network with 795 new store openings, taking the total store count at the end of the quarter to 16,617 stores with an area of 54.5 million square feet, Reliance said.  Retail EBITDA from operations increased 75.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,286 crore in Q2FY23, with a 130 basis point margin improvement over the same time last year resulting from favourable mix, positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies.  As consumers returned to stores, Reliance Retail received over 180 million footfalls across formats and geographies in the quarter, a growth of 23 percent over pre-COVID period, the company said.  8) Oil To Chemicals  The oil to chemicals (O2C) business reported a 32.5 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.59 lakh crore, primarily on account of higher crude oil prices.  Crude oil benchmarks rose YoY due to recovering oil demand, aggressive production cuts announced by OPEC+, limited spare capacity and imminent European Union sanctions on Russian oil exports. Dated Brent crude averaged $100.9 a barrel in Q2FY23, rising by $27.4 a barrel YoY, but declined by $13 per barrel QoQ.  RIL's production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent YoY to 16.2 MMT with planned turnaround of primary and secondary units of SEZ refinery for maintenance &amp;amp;amp; inspection.  &amp;quot;Performance of O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products. Transportation fuel margins were better than last year but significantly lower sequentially,&amp;quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  He further said the segment performance was also impacted by the introduction of special additional excise duties during the quarter to ensure stable supply and lower volatility in the domestic market.  At the operating level, its EBITDA declined by 5.9 percent YoY to Rs 11,968 crore primarily on account of introduction of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels and lower polymer deltas, with margin falling by 310 bps YoY to 7.5 percent.  9) Exports  Exports (including deemed exports) from RIL's India operations increased by 57.5 percent to Rs 86,382 crore compared to year-ago period, mainly due to higher price realizations despite lower downstream product volumes.  10) Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  &amp;quot;Domestic oil &amp;amp;amp; gas business continued to deliver robust performance maintaining production at 19 MMSCMD levels in the KG D6 block, significantly enhancing energy security for the country. We are confident of commissioning MJ Fields by year-end,&amp;quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment clocked a 134.4 percent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 3,853 crore led by higher production and improved gas price realization.  KG-D6 gas production during the quarter was at 41 BCF (RIL's share) against 39.2 BCF (billions of cubic feet) production in Q2FY22.  Average gas price realisation for KG-D6 increased sharply to $9.86 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBTU) during the quarter compared to $3.62 per MMBTU in Q2FY22, with raising of gas price ceiling by the Government of India for first half of FY23, Reliance said.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment reported nearly 3 times YoY increase in EBITDA to Rs 3,171 crore for the quarter, with margin expanding by 12.6 percentage points to 82.3 percent.

Revenues at the petrochemical major surged 33.7 percent to Rs 2.32 lakh crore, led by strong performance of the oil-to-chemical, telecom and retail operations in the quarter.

The company's consolidated operating profit in the quarter, including&nbsp;the impact of special additional excise duty imposed by the government in July, surged 14.5 percent on-year to Rs 34,663 crore, RIL said.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;Reliance Jio Q2 Result | Net profit rises 28% YoY, ARPU grows 23.5% to Rs 177.2  The government's special additional excise duty on export of refined products cost the company Rs 4,039 crore in the September quarter, RIL said. Excluding for the impact of the special excise duty, consolidated operating profit in the reported quarter rose 27.8 percent on-year to Rs 38,702 crore.  Overall,&nbsp;RIL's operating profit at the consolidated level was aided by&nbsp;the record quarterly operating profit reported by its arms Reliance Retail and Jio&nbsp;Platforms.  &amp;quot;I am pleased with the record performance of our consumer businesses which&nbsp;continue to scale new milestones every quarter,&amp;quot; Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said in a press statement.  RIL said that its overall outstanding debt as on September 30, 2022 was at Rs 2.94&nbsp;lakh crore while cash and cash&nbsp;equivalents stood at Rs&nbsp;2.01&nbsp;lakh crore. Net debt, therefore, rose to Rs 93,253 crore.  RIL&rsquo;s debt increased in the quarter due to higher working capital given the significant dislocation in energy markets, impact of foreign currency liabilities as rupee depreciated against the US dollar and payment of&nbsp;first&nbsp;installment for spectrum, said&nbsp;Srikanth Venkatachari, joint chief financial officer at the conglomerate.  Oil-to-chemical  The oil-to-chemical business of RIL saw strong growth in topline with sales jumping 32.5 percent on-year to Rs 1.6 lakh crore. However, the segment's operating profit fell 5.9 percent on-year to Rs 11,968 crore owing to decline in global refining margins and government's special excise duty.  &amp;quot;Performance of our O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  RIL&rsquo;s production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent year-on-year with planned turnaround of primary and&nbsp;secondary units of special economic zone (SEZ) refinery for M&amp;amp;amp;A.  RIL said its joint venture with Bp continued to face adverse market conditions due to retail fuel prices remaining capped despite higher global crude oil prices.  &amp;quot;Jio-bp is committed to safeguarding interest of channel&nbsp;partners while meeting universal service obligations,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Jio Platforms  The&nbsp;digital services business of RIL, which included Reliance Jio, had a strong quarter on a sequential basis.  The segment's operating profit jumped 5.1 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis to Rs 12,011 crore, aided by strong addition of new customers and benefit of recent tariff hikes at the telecom subsidiary.  Reliance Jio added net new subscribers to the tune of 7.7 million in the September quarter, taking the total user base to 427.6 million as of September 30.  The operating margin of the digital services business also saw a marked improvement to 49.5 percent in the reported quarter from 48.7 percent in the previous&nbsp;quarter.  Organised Retail  The organised retail segment had a record quarter, aided by the full re-opening of the domestic economy post the COVID-19 related restrictions seen through large parts of 2021-22.  The segment's revenues jumped 44.5 percent on-year to Rs 57,694 crore in the reported quarter, which was aided by strong new store additions and footfalls. RIL said it received over 180 million footfalls in the September quarter, which was a 23 percent jump over pre-COVID-19 levels.  During the quarter, the company opened 795 new stores to take the total store count to 16,617.  &amp;quot;The quarter was marked by an operating environment at par with pre-COVID levels as the impact&nbsp;of pandemic waned,&amp;quot; RIL said.  The oil-to-chemical major said that across town classes, consumer sentiments remained positive on the back of&nbsp;key promotional events and early onset of festivities.  &amp;quot;Overall, the results reflect strong operational execution that keeps it well poised to deliver sustainable&nbsp;growth in the period ahead,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  The oil and gas production business of RIL benefitted from the surge in domestic administered natural gas prices during the quarter.  RIL reported a 134.4 percent year-on-year surge in revenues to Rs 3,853 crore, driven by higher realisation for the natural gas that the company produces from difficult-to-produce fields.  Operating&nbsp;profit of the segment nearly tripled on a year-on-year basis to Rs 3,171 crore in the quarter while operating margins rose 17.2 percentage points to 82.3 percent.  During the quarter, RIL produced 43.6 billions of cubic feet equivalent as against 52 billions of cubic feet equivalent in the year ago quarter.  Media  The media and broadcasting business reported a 11.7 percent year-on-year growth in revenues to Rs 1,549 crore during the reported quarter.  The segment's operating profit plummeted 87.4 percent on-year to Rs 32 crore while operating margins shrank to 2.1 percent from 18.2 percent a year-ago.  RIL said that the business faced&nbsp;issues&nbsp;from a challenging&nbsp;advertising environment, flat subscription revenue and advertisement revenue loss from removal of Hindi GEC&nbsp;from DD FreeDish.  &amp;quot;Advertising environment during the quarter was subdued as brands held back advertising spends on&nbsp;new product launches and sustenance campaigns due to the continued inflationary headwinds,&amp;quot; RIL said.  On October 21, shares of Reliance Industries ended 1.2 percent lower at Rs 2,470 on the NSE.  (Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The revenue from operations grew by 22.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 24,275 crore driven by an ARPU increase for the connectivity business.  At the operating level, Jio Platforms recorded a 29.2 percent year-on-year increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Rs 12,011 crore led by strong revenue growth and margin improvement.  The margin at 49.5 percent increased by 250 bps YoY due to ARPU's increase in connectivity business partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs, Reliance said. The sequential increase in EBITDA was 5 percent and the margin expanded by 80 bps.  Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The company is likely to report a 12 percent on-year increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 15,263 crore in the September quarter, according to the average of estimates by six securities firms.  The company will report its September quarter earnings on October 21.  Profit will be driven by strong consolidated revenue, which is expected to rise 34 percent on year on year to Rs 2.25 lakh crore in the quarter.    Revenue will be aided by strength in the energy business, which will benefit from better gross refining margins and strong demand compared to the year-ago quarter.  A robust performance by the telecom and retail business, in particular, will boost on-year revenue.  The retail business should have benefited from strong footfalls and demand compared to the year-ago quarter, when the business was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Full reopening of the economy in the quarter gone by, along with strong festive demand, should have helped the retail business deliver strong sales growth.  Energy business&nbsp;  While the year-on-year performance of RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemical vertical will be strong, its sequential growth could have been soft due to a decline in global gross refining margins from their lifetime highs in the June quarter as well as the imposition of additional duties on the export of refining products imposed by the government.  &ldquo;Energy markets have been volatile in the past quarter, and windfall taxes added to challenges,&rdquo; Morgan Stanley, which has an &lsquo;overweight&rsquo; rating on RIL, wrote in a preview on the earnings.  Morgan Stanley said RIL&rsquo;s earnings may have fallen sequentially as the oil-to-chemicals business was affected by refinery shutdowns, the windfall fuel export tax, and lower product cracks.  Singapore&rsquo;s Gross Refining Margin (GRM), a key benchmark to gauge refining margins in Asia, plummeted 51 percent sequentially to $9.1 per barrel in the September quarter because of a decline in gasoline and fuel oil cracks.  The sharp decline in the Singapore GRM will have an impact on RIL&rsquo;s margin, but continued strength in middle distillate products like diesel and air turbine fuel should have offset some of the impact, analysts said.  Retail and telecom&nbsp;  Analysts expect no surprises in the earnings performance of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm in the September quarter. On a sequential basis, both verticals are expected to have performed well, driven by high customer acquisitions in telecom and strong footfalls in retail.  IIFL Securities sees the retail segment registering 36 percent on-year growth in sales and a 7.5 percent core margin in the September quarter.  On the telecom side, acquisition of new customers and recent tariff hikes should result in 3-5 percent sequential growth in revenue.  Analysts expect the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of Reliance Jio to rise 1.9 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis from Rs 176 reported in the previous quarter.  Jio is estimated to have added more than 9 million net new users in the September quarter, analysts said.  &ldquo;Sequential ARPU improvement is backed by residual impact of the past tariff hike (higher proportion of longer-dated plans),&rdquo; Emkay Global Financial Services said.

Follow our LIVE coverage of PM Modi&rsquo;s 5G launch in India  Read the text of Ambani&rsquo;s full special address at the IMC event below:  Most respected Prime Minister Shri Narendrabhai Modiji,  Honourable Minister Shri Vaishnawji,  Honourable Minister of State Shri Chauhanji,  Secretary Telecom Shri Rajaramanji,  My good friends from the industry, Sunil and Kumar,  Distinguished delegates,  Ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning.  My hearty congratulations to DoT and COAI for organising the sixth edition of the Indian Mobile Congress.  I can whole-heartedly say today that as Indian telecom industry, what we have demonstrated, I feel very proud. And to both COAI and DoT I can say that we are now ready to take leadership and the Indian Mobile Congress should now become the Asian Mobile Congress and the Global Mobile Congress.  Today is also very special because it coincides with our national celebration of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav.  Our beloved Prime Minister, Shri Narendrabhai Modi ji, has shared an inspiring vision of making India a developed nation by 2047. Every policy and every action of the government is skillfully crafted to propel India towards that goal.  The steps taken to fast-track India&rsquo;s march into the 5G era provide a compelling proof of our Prime Minister&rsquo;s determination. This is most heartening because 5G is much more than the next generation of connectivity technology. To my mind, It is a foundational technology that unlocks the full potential of other 21st century technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Robotics, Blockchain, and Metaverse.  In fact, I think of 5G as an acronym for &ldquo;5 Goals&rdquo; that fundamentally can transform our nation:  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5G and 5G-enabled digital solutions can bring affordable and high-quality education and skill development within the reach of common Indians. This will help young Indians realise their full potential by arming them with world class capabilities and competencies so that they can earn more and make India globally competitive.  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5G can affordably deliver high-quality healthcare to rural and remote areas by turning existing hospitals into smart hospitals without much additional investment. This will make services of best doctors digitally available anywhere in India, dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of diagnostics, and enable real-time clinical decision making. All this will enhance health, wealth and happiness of all Indians.  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5G can bridge the gap between urban and rural India by accelerating digitisation and intelligent data management of Agriculture, Services, Trade, Industry, Informal Sector, Transportation and Energy Infrastructure. This will create huge efficiencies in all economic activities, making India a hub of innovations, and also help us mitigate the climate crisis.  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5G can make available the same powerful productivity tools to small-scale industry and commercial enterprises as are used by large capital-intensive businesses. This will drive modernisation and profitability of all sectors of India&rsquo;s economy.  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By bringing Artificial Intelligence into every domain, 5G can power India&rsquo;s emergence as the world&rsquo;s intelligence capital. This will help India become a major exporter of high-value added digital solutions and services.  Achieving these five goals will trigger a huge explosion of entrepreneurship in our country, which in turn will attract even larger investments and create millions of new jobs for our young people.  By harnessing the combined power of demography and digital technologies, India can become the world&rsquo;s leading digital society, setting a benchmark for simultaneously achieving the dual goals of acceleration of growth and inclusion in development &ndash; acceleration of growth by making India a 40-trillion-dollar economy by 2047, up from $3 trillion today, and inclusion in development by increasing our per capita income rapidly to over $20,000, from $2,000 today.  Therefore, it will not be an exaggeration to say that 5G is like a Digital Kamadhenu, the heavenly cow that grants whatever we desire.  Esteemed dignitaries,  The rollout of 5G in India is not an ordinary event in India&rsquo;s telecom history. It carries the keen expectations and the high aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians. With 5G, India will take longer and faster strides towards Sab Ka Digital Saath and Sab Ka Digital Vikas.&nbsp; India may have started a little late, but I want to assure all of you, we will finish first by rolling out 5G services across the length and breadth of India. And as an industry, we will ensure that we have the highest quality and the most affordable rates than anyone else has in the world.  Today, I want to reiterate Jio&rsquo;s commitment to deliver 5G to every town, every taluka, and every tehsil of our country by December 2023. Most of Jio&rsquo;s 5G is developed in India, and hence carries the stamp of Atmanirbhar Bharat.  On this occasion, I would like to congratulate Honourable Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw ji and the Government of India for their efforts to strengthen BSNL. A strong BSNL will bring the balancing presence of a government entity in this very strategic sector.  Most Respected Pradhan Mantri ji,  Before I conclude, I would like to express a deep-seated emotion of pride in my heart. A pride felt by every Indian. Your leadership has raised India&rsquo;s prestige, profile and power globally like never before. In today&rsquo;s fast-changing world, there will be no stopping a resurgent India from soaring to the top &ndash; a place that is rightfully ours. India and Indians can&rsquo;t settle for anything less. All of us at the Indian Mobile Congress assure you that we will work together and walk together under your guidance towards the glorious future that awaits our nation.  Thank you. Happy Navaratri to all of you and all my fellow Indians.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Reliance Industries Ltd chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani reaffirmed his commitment to new energy during the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 29.  Ambani said &ldquo;achieving carbon neutrality globally will require multi decade of investments to the tune of $5 trillion per year, which makes Reliance&rsquo;s new energy vision far more transformational and far more global&rdquo;.  The company plans to invest Rs 75,000 crore in new energy.  &ldquo;We have made rapid progress to create an advanced manufacturing ecosystem for new energy, which will be fully integrated, backed by world-class talent, built on pillars of technological innovation through strategic partnerships, to deliver modular, at scale, affordable and most modern manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world,&rdquo; Ambani said.  Market experts said that Reliance&rsquo;s big plans will ensure that the company stays highly valued even as the traditional fossil fuel companies struggle to keep their companies from getting de-rated because of ESG concerns.  Baring this year, as several companies saw stock price head higher because of a surge in oil prices and refining markets, the perception of fossil fuel companies remains poor as the world moves with greater resolve toward new energy to reduce carbon footprint.  &ldquo;We are aiming for continuous hyper-growth over many decades from new energy and to establish India as a world leader in new energy advanced manufacturing&rdquo;, the RIL chairman said.

It has set the ball rolling to establish Giga scale gH2 manufacturing in India.  The company will also establish 20 GW solar generation capacity by 2025&ndash;for round-the-clock and intermittent power for gH2.  Green hydrogen&nbsp;is generated from electrolysis of water, with the entire process run on renewable energy.  Also read: Reliance Industries AGM 2022: RIL to build gigacomplex for power electronics  De-rating of oil companies  The traditional oil manufacturing companies the world over face the risk of getting de-rated in the event of a fall in crude prices, as future growth is likely to shift to new energy.  Even though these companies will continue to generate cash, as oil will continue to find usage the world over for years to come, these companies are likely to see a continued de-rating on future growth concerns.  Until last year, most global oil companies, including giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobile, were trading at low earnings multiples and high dividend yields because of poor investor perception.  But the story may be vastly different for Reliance, despite its dominance in the oil business. Its mega plans of becoming a global leader in new energy businesses, experts feel will not only help the company achieve its target of becoming carbon-neutral but also aid in avoiding a possible de-rating of the stock.

Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail provide ample proof of it. But the new energy business plans ensure a multi-year growth engine even as the investor perception improves rather than deteriorates.  &ldquo;With the new energy mega plan, Reliance is again going to do it directly into the new energy ecosystems which are going to replace conventional oil ecosystems,&rdquo; said Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital.  &ldquo;The full span from solar energy production to hydrogen technology and battery grid for energy storage makes it likely that Reliance might get entrenched in the new energy ecosystem&rdquo;.  Gupta is of the opinion that the company&rsquo;s return ratios could dip in the medium term while the ramp up of new tech is going on but it is unlikely that the stock will face any de-rating.  &ldquo;However, the market will give credit for the capital work in progress and a premium for the new clean-tech keeping in mind that whenever Reliance has entered a new arena it has become a keystone species in that new ecosystem,&rdquo; Gupta said.

Investors and analysts have come to expect major announcements from the conglomerate. Last year, it was the entry into green energy, and the year before, it was the induction of Google as a minority investor. In 2016, it was the launch of telecom services.  Time and Date  The AGM will be held via video conferencing for the third consecutive year on August 29. The meeting will start at 2:00 pm IST, with addresses and presentations expected from chairman Mukesh Ambani and other members of the company&rsquo;s board and subsidiaries.  Also Read |&nbsp;Reliance to hold its 45th AGM on August 29: All you need to know  The board of directors and shareholders will then vote on 11 resolutions. Six of them are special resolutions, including the appointment of Hital Meswani as a whole-time director, and the insertion of clauses in its articles of association with respect to its new energy business.  Stock Movement  Reliance shares tend to move considerably ahead of and after the AGM. The shares have averaged negligible returns a week prior to the AGM, based on data of the past 10 years. However, they rose almost 4 percent a week after the event, Bloomberg data showed.  Additionally, the shares gained 2.3 percent a month before the AGM and returned more than 6 percent a month after the event, the data showed.  Trading in the stock tends to pick up around the annual event. On average, daily volumes on the counter have spiked 317 percent on the day of the AGM over the past five years. AGM day is easily the most active for the stock.  Big Expectations  As with every Reliance AGM, investors have a set of expectations.  This year, the focus will be on the consumer retail business once again, after chatter that a time line is likely to be announced for the listing of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail. The induction of private equity investors in both its consumer-facing subsidiaries in 2020 was seen as a stepping stone towards their eventual listing.  Brokerage JP Morgan India said in a recent note that Reliance has enhanced disclosures around related-party transactions, which is seen as a step towards greater transparency ahead of the listing.  &ldquo;While it is too early to say if the increased disclosures on the large transactions between the subsidiaries are a step on the road to the listing of these businesses, it would be seen as a positive,&rdquo; JP Morgan said.  Another key expectation will be around the new energy business, which emerged as the biggest takeaway at last year&rsquo;s AGM. Reliance has since invested in acquiring companies in the segment and expanding capacity.  The company plans to build four gigafactories to manufacture solar panels, electric batteries, green hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells with an investment of $80 billion. The company sees renewable energy and green hydrogen as tectonic shifts in meeting the world&rsquo;s energy demands.  In the company&rsquo;s annual report, Ambani said he expects the green energy business to be the crown jewel of the company in the next seven years, much like he heralded the consumer-facing businesses about seven years ago.  Brokerage JM Financial said investors will await any indication of the induction of strategic investors in the company&rsquo;s oil-to-chemicals and green energy business as Relance steps up activity in the space.  Attention will also be on Reliance&rsquo;s plan to roll out 5G mobile phone services after the company mopped up the most spectrum in the recent auction. Reliance invested $11.3 billion to acquire 25 gigahertz of spectrum from the government.  Investors will wait for indications of the pricing of the new 5G services that step-down subsidiary Reliance Jio will offer.  Traders can expect good moves in the stock if the company were to make announcements with respect to these expectations, said dealers.  Beyond AGM  Reliance&rsquo;s June quarter performance was slightly underwhelming, given the expectations built up due to the surge in global refining margins. The introduction of a special additional excise duty on refining exports also dampened spirits, but analysts remain buoyed over the stock&rsquo;s prospects.  Of 39 brokerages covering the company, 31 have an outright &lsquo;buy&rsquo; rating on the stock while three have a &lsquo;hold&rsquo; rating with an average upside of about 12 percent expected in the scrip over the next 12 months.  UBS Securities upgraded the stock recently to a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; from &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; as it factored in opportunities in the green energy business, which it said could create additional value of $35 billion for the company by 2030.

The oil-to-telecom giant reported a&nbsp;54.5 percent on-year growth in consolidated revenue from operations to Rs&nbsp;2.23 lakh crore,&nbsp;which was also below Street's estimate of Rs 2.4 lakh crore.  &amp;quot;Despite significant challenges posed by the tight crude markets and higher energy and freight costs, O2C business has delivered its best performance ever. I am also happy with the progress of our Consumer platforms,&amp;quot; said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani in a press statement.  RIL reported a 45.8 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated operating profit to a record high of Rs 40,179 crore for the quarter ended June.  Refining and Petrochemical  The strength in the company's June quarter performance came from the&nbsp;refining and petrochemical&nbsp;division which posted its highest ever quarterly revenue aided by a tight global energy market.  The segment reported 56.7 percent on-year growth in revenues to Rs 1.6 lakh crore aided by strong gross refining margins in the international market.  &amp;quot;Despite significant challenges posed by the tight crude markets and higher energy and freight costs, O2C business has delivered its best performance eve,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  The operating performance of the segment was strong as operating profit jumped 62.6 percent on-year to Rs 19,888 crore.  The embargo by the European Union on Russian oil products, higher gas to oil switching, strong travel demand and lower product inventory levels resulted in tight fuel markets, RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  The vertical performed strongly in the June quarter with revenues rising 183 percent on-year to Rs 3,625 crore aided by higher administered gas prices for the domestic market.  The company said that KGD6 gas production during the June quarter was at 40.6 billion cubic feet as against&nbsp;33.1 billion cubic feet in the year-ago quarter. Average gas price realized by RIL for KGD6 gas was at $ 9.72&nbsp;per mmBtu&nbsp;as against&nbsp;$3.62&nbsp;per mmBtu&nbsp;in the year-ago quarter.  The segment's operating profit&nbsp;soared 243.4 percent on-year to Rs 2,737 crore largely because of higher volumes and realisations in the quarter.  The oil and gas business witnessed higher revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization driven by higher gas price and production.  RIL said that in its KG D6-MJ Gas and Condensate fields the final offshore subsea production installation campaign is underway and is likely to be completed by the second quarter of FY23. The company is also planning to start drilling for exploration at the KG UDW1 well next year.  &ldquo;The whole idea is, any resources that we can create, we can monetize the existing infrastructure. So the prospect maturation is underway and we expect to undertake an exploration (for KG UDW1) next year. Once the energy field is commissioned, we should be progressively moving towards delivering more than 1 bcf per day by FY24,&rdquo; said Sanjay Roy, senior vice-president for exploration and production.  Outlook  RIL pegs oil demand to average 99.2 million barrel per day globally, up1.7 million barrel per day year-on-year.  &ldquo;There is limited spare refining capacity and the strong oil demand will keep refining margins higher. There is clear recovery in aviation demand because the pandemic is subsiding. There are lower exports from China which are supporting margins,&rdquo; V Shrikanth, joint chief financial officer said. He added that certain petrochemical products may see range bound margins due to capacity overhang.  He said that transport fuel demand globally is likely to remain strong. Polymer and polyester demand is likely to pick up with the upcoming festival season.  &ldquo;On the challenges side, we have been seeing the whole concern of recession, slowdown on the back of both higher prices as well as the responses by various central banks all over the world wanting to take interest rates up to curb inflation&hellip;Any duty on exports you know will have an impact on overall realization that we have,&rdquo; Shrikanth said.  Jio Platforms  The consumer technology business, which houses the telecom operations, reported a 23.8 percent on-year growth in revenue from operations to Rs 23,467 crore.  Net subscriber addition witnessed a strong rebound to 9.7 million in the June quarter driven by continued strength in gross additions at&nbsp;35.2 million and reduced SIM consolidation impact, the company said.  Average revenue per user saw 4.8 percent sequential rise to Rs 175.7 as the company benefited from the tariff hikes undertaken last year.  The segment's operating profit jumped 28.5 percent on-year to Rs 11,424 crore on healthy subscriber addition and realisations.  Reliance Retail  The first COVID-19 restriction free quarter helped RIL's organised retail business to thrive as footfalls improved even though ongoing inflationary environment capped performance.  The segment reported a 53.7 percent on-year rise in revenue from operations to Rs 51,582 crore in the reported quarter. &amp;quot;Consumer spending got a boost as families indulged in leisure activities, socializing, festivities and shopping as COVID situation improved though sentiments remained cautious due to inflationary concerns,&amp;quot; RIL said.  RIL said that footfalls were recorded at 175 million for the June quarter, which was 19&nbsp;percent above pre-COVID levels as consumers returned to stores.  &amp;quot;Consumer sentiments remain positive, though a bit cautious on the discretionary spend due to the inflation concerns,&amp;quot; said Gaurav Jain, head (strategy and business development) at Reliance Retail.  The segment's operating profit jumped 180.4 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 3,897 crore aided by a low base of the year-ago quarter, which was disrupted by&nbsp;second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Reliance Retail's operating margisn improved sharply to 7.6 percent in the reported quarter from 4.1 percent in the year ago quarter and 7.1 percent in the previous quarter.  The strong demand environment and expansion of store saw net profit of the retail segment rise 114.2 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 2,061 crore in the reported quarter.

The ARPU during the quarter stood at Rs 175.7 per subscriber per month with a YoY growth of 27 percent while sequentially the ARPU improved by 4.8 percent. This was a result of higher customer engagement and increase in traffic.

The impact of SIM consolidation witnessed a decline as compared to the previous quarters.

The brokerage firm said that its rating upgrade is driven by improvement in earnings outlook of the refining and upstream gas business as well as the consumer technology businesses&rsquo; valuations holding.  JP Morgan believes RIL&rsquo;s outperformance to the Nifty 50 will continue in 2022 given that there is a good chance of upgrades to Street&rsquo;s earnings expectations for the company. The brokerage has raised its earnings per share estimate for RIL by 19 percent for 2022-23 and 17 percent for 2023-24.  &ldquo;Our earnings estimates imply a sharp pullback in diesel and gasoline cracks from current record level, but RIL remains among the best positioned refiners globally, given: ability to buy and process arbitrage barrels, diesel heavy slate and, export focus,&rdquo; JP Morgan India said in a note on June 16.  Another key factor behind the brokerage firm&rsquo;s altered view on the stock is the lack of correction in the valuations of RIL&rsquo;s consumer technology businesses. &ldquo;We had earlier expected the global Tech sell-off to impact RIL&rsquo;s consumer valuations negatively (Jio, Retail) and cancel out the near-term earnings upside,&rdquo; the brokerage house said.  JP Morgan said that likely higher average revenue per user for the telecom business and ramp-up in footprint of the organized retail operations combined with renewables business optionality, non-energy business valuations should hold up going ahead.  With respect to the upcoming annual general meeting of the oil-to-telecom major, JP Morgan said expectations center around potential demerger or initial public offering of consumer-facing businesses.  &ldquo;We do not expect any concrete timelines from this year&rsquo;s AGM on the consumer businesses IPOs (Jio, Retail), even though media reports have talked about IPOs of these businesses,&rdquo; JP Morgan India said.

The energy sector giant, which has operations in telecom and organized retail as well, reported a 22.5 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit&nbsp;at Rs 16,203 crore for the&nbsp;given&nbsp;quarter, which missed analysts&rsquo; expectations on account of a one-time impairment charge.  However, the conglomerate&rsquo;s consolidated revenues soared 36.8 percent on-year to Rs 2.1 lakh crore for the March quarter, which was in-line with Street&rsquo;s expectations driven by higher sales in the traditional energy business.  RIL&rsquo;s operating performance in the quarter was the highlight as consolidated operating profit jumped 27.7 percent on-year to Rs 33,968 crore, comfortable beating even the most optimistic estimate among the six brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.  &ldquo;One of best earnings growth stories among India&rsquo;s large-caps,&rdquo; said brokerage firm CLSA India as it raised its earnings per share (EPS) forecast for the next two years by 5-9 percent on account of higher margins in the refining business.  The refining business was the key driver of the performance for RIL in the March quarter as the segment&rsquo;s operating profit surged 25 percent on-year while revenues grew over 44 percent from the year-ago quarter.  Brokerage firm Jefferies India said that the refining business looks strong in 2022 due to geopolitical developments while the cash-cow petrochemical business could see challenges on account of lockdown in China.  &ldquo;With earnings boosted by energy inflation, RIL could act as a safe haven in today's context,&rdquo; Jefferies India said as it retained its &ldquo;buy&rdquo; rating on the stock.  Brokerage Goldman Sachs India expects the earnings momentum for RIL to pick up sharply in the coming quarters, which will help drive upgrades in Street&rsquo;s earnings estimate for the company. RIL&rsquo;s stock performance in the past has been closely correlated to Street&rsquo;s views on its earnings outlook.  Goldman Sachs expects 50 percent growth in operating profit of RIL in 2022-23 and 21 percent rise in 2023-24. Further, the brokerage firm expects full integration of JioMart with WhatsApp to also drive stock performance.  On May 6, shares of Reliance Industries closed 0.5 percent at Rs 2,628 on the National Stock Exchange.  Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate's consolidated revenue from operations surged 36.8 percent year-on-year to Rs&nbsp;2.1 lakh crore for the reported quarter, which met Street's estimate of Rs 2.1 lakh crore.  The company's board also recommended a dividend of Rs 8&nbsp;per share for the financial year ended March 31, 2022.  For FY22, RIL reported a record-high gross revenues of Rs 7.92 lakh crore or $104.6 billion, making it the first Indian company to achieve the $100-billion revenue mark. RIL also reported record annual consolidated net profit of Rs 67,845 crore for the financial year.  &amp;quot;Despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and heightened geo-political uncertainties, Reliance has delivered a robust performance in FY2021-22,&amp;quot; Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said in a press statement.  &amp;quot;I am pleased to report strong growth in our Digital Services and Retail segments. Our O2C business has proven its resilience and has demonstrated strong recovery despite volatility in the energy markets,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  Business performance  The strong topline growth of the company was driven by the oil-to-chemical business, which reported a 44.3 percent on-year&nbsp;growth in sales&nbsp;followed by the retail business where revenues jumped 23.2 percent.  The oil-to-chemical business' growth was driven by the refining side of the operations, where surging global refining margins during the quarter aided the company's performance.  The strong topline performance reflected in RIL's operating show as well, with consolidated operating profit jumping 27.7 percent on-year to Rs 33,968 crore.  Oil-to-chemicals  The refining and petrochemicals business of Reliance Industries had a stellar showing in the March quarter aided by tightness in the global refning market that pushed margins higher.  The operating profit of the oil-to-chemicals segment surged nearly 25 percent on-year to Rs 14,241 crore, led by multi-quarter high transportation fuel cracks, which was partially offset by lower polymer and intermediates margins and higher energy cost.    Overall surge in global&nbsp;crude oil prices drove the 44 percent sales growth in the segment, which was also supported by volume growth of 4.2 percent on steady recovery in demand.  &amp;quot;O2C was firm despite volatility caused due to the Ukraine conflict. Strength in fuel cracks offset by the weakness in the downstream chemical margins and high energy cost,&amp;quot; said&nbsp;Shrikanth Venkatachari, the joint chief financial officer of Reliance Industries at a press meet.  However,&nbsp;operating margin for the quarter in the O2C segment declined by 150 basis points on-year&nbsp;to 9.8&nbsp;percent. &amp;quot;This was primarily due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Jio&nbsp;Platforms  The digital services business of RIL continued its strong showing led by the telecom business, which reported 8 percent sequential growth in revenues and 15.4 percent on-quarter rise in net profit.  Operating&nbsp;profit of the digital segment grew 27.4 percent on-year to Rs 10,918 crore and contributed a third of the quarter's consolidated operating profit.  The average revenue per user of the telecom business jumped 10.5 percent on-quarter to Rs 167.6, reflecting the benefits from tariff hikes taken by the company last year.  The telecom subscriber base stood at 410.2 million at the end of the March quarter as the company lost 10.9 million users during the quarter due to ongoing consolidation of the user base.  Reliance Retail  The organised retail business had a resilient performance in the reported quarter despite the threat from the spread of Omicron variant of COVID-19 earlier in the quarter.  Topline of the segment rose 23.1 percent to record quarterly sales of Rs 50,834 crore. &amp;quot;The headwinds posed by the COVID situation in January were offset by the robust growth in February and March as the business leveraged festive events and early setting of summer season,&amp;quot; RIL said.  While operating profit in the retail segment grew 16.3 percent on-year to Rs 3,584 crore, operating margins shrank 40 basis points to 4.1 percent reflecting the impact of high inflation.  RIL said it opened 793 stores during the March quarter and saw double-digit growth in all consumption baskets. The digital side of the business saw good traction in the year as daily orders more than doubled on a year-on-year basis.  &amp;quot;Grocery business continued its growth momentum and delivered its best ever quarter driven by strong growth across its store formats, digital and new commerce platforms,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  The revival in the company's oil and gas business continued aided by a favourable business environment given the surge in international natural gas and crude oil prices.  Revenues of the segment rose 137 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 2,008 crore while operating profit rose more than three-fold to Rs 1,556 crore.  The gas production from KGD6 fields during the reported quarter was at 37.7&nbsp;billion cubic feet (RIL&rsquo;s share) as against 15 billion cubic feet in the year ago quarter.  RIL's average realisation for its natural gas rose to $6.1 per mmBtu during the quarter from $3.99 per mmBtu in the year-ago quarter.  On May 6, shares of&nbsp;Reliance Industries ended 0.5 percent lower at Rs 2,628 on the National Stock Exchange. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Revenues jumped to Rs 20,901 crore from 19,347 crore in the last quarter. In terms of profitability, the telecom giant crossed key landmarks with EBITDA over Rs 10,000 crore while margin surpassed the 50-percent mark.  Reliance Jio&rsquo;s average revenue per user (ARPU) beat estimates with a healthy 10.6 percent QoQ growth at Rs 167.6. Tariff hike of 20 percent has kicked in for profitability improvement for the company. Better subscriber mix has also aided in the ARPU performance.    &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Subscriber base for Jio continued to shrink ending at 410.2 million at the end of March, 2022 from 440.6 million at the end of the first quarter of the fiscal. Management said, &ldquo;SIM consolidation post tariff hike resulting in net subscriber reduction.&rdquo; Jio also highlighted, &ldquo;Recent trends indicate that SIM consolidation is abating as tariff hike impact is absorbed.&rdquo;  Customer engagement grew for the telecom service provider with data traffic growth of 47.5 percent YoY to 24.6 Exabytes during the fourth quarter.

JioFiber clocks in a total of 6 million connected premises with an average five hours of daily endgame to on the set-top-box.  Tariff hike in the telecom sector has provided the much needed boost to Jio&rsquo;s performance but the decline on the subscriber front has been a concern for the analysts. However, management&rsquo;s positive commentary on abating of subscriber reduction with tariff hike being absorbed is expected to allay concerns on this front."

The conglomerate is expected to report a 38 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 17,167 crore for the quarter ended March, according to an average of six brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.  The company&rsquo;s consolidated revenues are likely to rise 43 percent on year to Rs 2.1 lakh crore for the reported quarter driven in large part by a bump in earnings of the refining business.  Analysts expect the refining business of RIL to benefit from the surge in global gross refining margins triggered by sanctions imposed on Russia&rsquo;s oil exports by Western economies following the country&rsquo;s invasion of Europe.  Singapore benchmark gross refining margins soared 350 percent on year, and 32 percent on quarter, to $8.1 per barrel in the March quarter that will significantly boost RIL&rsquo;s earnings from selling refining products.  Further, the surge in prices of middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel during the quarter triggered by high demand and supply disruptions would further aid earnings of the legacy business of the conglomerate.  &ldquo;Notwithstanding the stock&rsquo;s upmove from its recent lows, we believe the strength in refining is being under-estimated, with RIL particularly well-placed in the current environment given a combination of high diesel yield, high diesel output, high export ratio, and high complexity,&rdquo; said brokerage firm Citigroup India in a recent note.  That said, the performance of the oil-to-chemical business is likely to be tempered by the weakness in margins of the petrochemical division because of higher crude oil prices as well as declining international margins for key products.  Robust Telecom Growth  The telecom operations of RIL will also provide strong support to earnings with brokerage firm Jefferies India expecting a 10 percent sequential rise in revenues.  The surge in revenues will be driven by the full impact of recent tariff hikes undertaken by the industry recently with Reliance Jio Infocomm&rsquo;s average revenue per user likely to rise by 9-12 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.  However, the churn in subscriber base of Reliance Jio is likely to continue in the reported quarter with analysts expecting the company to lose more than 9 million users as it reduces the presence of inactive and low revenue users.  Retail Recovery  Brokerage firm BofA Securities expects the growth momentum for Reliance Retail to improve in the March quarter despite the impact of localized lockdowns in the early part of the quarter due to the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.  &ldquo;We expect the business momentum to pick-up and expect 30% YoY growth on low-base effect of lock-downs easing up. We also expect the momentum of online apps JioMart and AJIO to be strong,&rdquo; BofA Securities said.  Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley India expects revenues to rise 15 percent sequentially with similar sequential rise in operating profits. However, the operating performance is likely to be muted on a year-on-year basis due to impact of high competition in the sector and high inflation.

The government-dictated price for natural gas produced in the country is to be revised on April 1 and factoring in the spike in energy prices witnessed last year, the rate paid for gas produced from fields given to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on nomination basis is likely to rise to $5.93 per million British thermal units from current $2.9.  Simultaneously, difficult fields like the ones in Reliance and its partner bp plc operated D6 block in KG basin, are likely to get $9.9-10.1 price compared to the current rate of $6.13, two sources aware of the matter said.  These are the highest rates for administered/regulated fields (like ONGC&rsquo;s Bassein field off the Mumbai coast) and free-market areas (such as the KG basin).  Also, this will be the second increase in rates since April 2019 and comes on the back of firming benchmark international prices.  The government sets the price of gas every six months &mdash; on April 1 and October 1 &mdash; each year based on rates prevalent in gas surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia in one year with a lag of one quarter.  So, the price for April 1 to September 30 is based on the average price from January 2021 to December 2021.  This is the period when global rates shot through the roofs.  The volume-weighted average of the price prevalent in a 12-month period in US-based Henry Hub, Canada-based Alberta gas, UK-based NBP and Russia gas are used to fix price for administered fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd.  For difficult fields like discoveries in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and high pressure-high temperature areas, a slightly modified formula is used by incorporating the price of LNG, which too had shot through the roof in 2021.  Reliance-bp operated KG fields are classified as difficult fields.  The sources said the increase in gas price is likely to result in a rise in CNG and piped cooking gas rates in cities, such as Delhi and Mumbai.  It will also lead to a rise in the cost of generating electricity but consumers may not feel any major pinch as the share of power produced from gas is very low.  Similarly, the cost of producing fertiliser will also go up but as the government subsidises the crop nutrient, an increase in rates is unlikely.  For producers, this will be the first time in six years that they will get a remunerative price.  ONGC had been incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had &amp;quot;inherent limitations&rdquo; as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada, and Russia.  The sources said ONGC had in several communications to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of $5-9 per MMBtu and that for old fields such as Mumbai High and Bassein is about $3.6-3.7.  The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates, but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.  The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter.  The rate at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till it touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period.  Subsequently, it rose to $3.69 in April 2019-September 2019 before being cut in subsequent rounds to $1.79.

Higher ARPUs (average revenue per user) in telecom and strong rebound in retail demand aided the growth in its telecom and retail business.  O2C Business  The growth in this business was aided by higher crude prices coupled with higher volumes and better realizations which enabled a 56.8 percent YoY growth in its revenues to Rs 1,31,427 crore. Total throughput (including refinery throughput) improved by 8.2 percent on year and 5.3 percent on quarter to 19.7 MMT (million metric tonnes).  The global demand for crude improved by 4.8 mb/d (million barrels/day) compared to the same quarter a year ago to 99.0 mb/d. Compared to previous quarter, this is up by 1.1 mb/d. This was driven by strong consumption demand and opening up of skies which resulted in increased international travel.  The average rate for brent crude during the quarter stood at USD 79.7 /bbl &nbsp;which was up USD 6.3/bbl (billion barrel) QoQ and USD 35.5/bbl YoY.  &ldquo;The recovery in global oil and energy markets supported strong fuel margins and helped our O2C business deliver robust earnings. Our Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment delivered strong growth in EBITDA with volume growth and improved realization&rdquo;, added Ambani.  Polymer demand during the quarter witnessed a reduction of 3% on quarter and 4% on year. It however, continued to be above pre-COVID level. The polymer prices were higher during the quarter with the prices for PVC touching reaching all time high.  The EBITDA for the business witnessed a strong growth of 38.7 percent to Rs 13,530 crore. It achieved an EBITDA margin of 10.3 percent which were lower from 11.6 percent margins achieved during the year ago quarter.  Jio Platforms  The telecom business had another strong quarter and achieved gross revenues of Rs 24,176 crore, a YoY growth of 13.8 percent (adjusted for Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC)). The growth in business was driven by robust addition of 10.2 million net customers during the quarter which took the total customer base for the telecom business to 421 million.  The ARPU (average revenue per user) came in at Rs 151.6 per subscriber per month which was up 5.6 percent from the previous quarter. Total data traffic during the quarter was 23.4 billion GB, a growth 47.8 percent from the same quarter a year ago.  The business achieved an EBITDA of Rs 10,008 crore at a YoY growth of 18 percent while the net profit for the business grew by a healthy 8.9 percent YoY to Rs 3,795 crore.  Retail Business  Reliance retail saw its gross revenues jump by massive 52.5 percent to record an all time high revenues of Rs 57,714 crore driven by the rebound in retail demand. The business received strong traction from highest ever store sales and sustained growth momentum in digital &amp;amp;amp; new commerce. Strong festive sales doubled the revenues in its Consumer Electronics and Apparel &amp;amp;amp; Footwear businesses while double-digit growth sustained in the Grocery business.  &ldquo;Retail business activity has normalized with strong growth in key consumption baskets on the back of festive season and as lockdowns eased across the country. Our digital services business has delivered broad based, sustainable, and profitable growth through improved customer engagement and subscriber mix&rdquo;, said Ambani.  Strong overall performance helped the business achieve an EBITDA of Rs 3,822 crore, a robust hike of 23.8 percent. Its net profit grew by a similar margin of 23.4 percent to Rs 2,259 crore.  The company added 837 new stores during the quarter, thereby increasing its total operational stores to 14,412. This enabled the company to add 8.8 million square feet of operational area which took the total operational area to 40 million square feet.  Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, invested USD 200 million for 25.8 percent stake on a fully diluted basis in Dunzo, India&rsquo;s leading quick commerce player. This acquisition will add onto Reliance Retail&rsquo;s omni-channel capabilities and facilitate last mile deliveries for JioMart&rsquo;s merchant network.  Solar Energy Business  Ambani said that the company is making steady progress towards achieving its vision of Net Carbon Zero by 2035. &ldquo;Our recent partnerships and investments in technology leaders in the solar and green energy space is illustrative of our commitment to partner India and the World in the transition to clean and green energy&rdquo;, he added.  During the quarter, Reliance New Energy Limited (RNEL), a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL signed definitive agreements to acquire 100 percent shareholding in Faradion Limited for an enterprise value of GBP 100 million. Faradion is one of the leading global battery technology companies whose sodium-ion technology provides a leading energy storage and battery solution which is safe, sustainable, provides high energy density and is significantly cost competitive.  RNEL also acquired 25.16 percent of Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy Limited (SWREL) (formerly Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited) through subscription to preferential offer. It will acquire further stake by way of open offer and secondary purchase to take its total stake in the company to 40 percent.  The company intends to enhance its presence in the consumer and hospitality segment for which it acquired 73.37% stake in Mandarin Oriental Hotel New York, for an equity consideration of approximately USD 98.15 million.  The Reliance Industries stock closed flat at Rs 2,477.85, on the National Stock Exchange on January 21. The stock has generated returns of 18 percent in the past one year and gained 7 percent in the past one month."

The oil-to-telecom-and-retail giant will declare its results for the quarter later today. Brokerages expect the Mukesh Ambani-led company to report 50-60 percent year-on-year growth in its consolidated revenues at Rs 1.81-1.91&nbsp;lakh crore for the quarter, and a 12-16 percent growth in post-tax profit (PAT) to Rs 14,800-15,300 crore for the quarter. The company had reported a consolidated profit of Rs 13,101 crore on consolidated revenues of Rs 1.18 lakh&nbsp;crore during the corresponding quarter a year ago. The figure for the previous quarter stood at Rs 13,680 crore with the company registering consolidated revenues of Rs 1.7 lakh crore. Earnings Estimates Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal expects a robust growth in the company&rsquo;s O2C (oil to chemical) business followed by retail. It forecasts an on-year growth of 61.7 percent in consolidated revenues to Rs 1.91 lakh crore. On a sequential basis, this will be a growth of 13.7 percent. It expects the refinery throughput at 17.2 MMT (million metric tonnes) with the per-tonne EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) improving to $116.6 on improved Singapore GRM and petrochemical margins. &ldquo;Singapore GRM improved further QoQ in Q3FY22, primarily led by improved diesel and ATF cracks (which almost doubled QoQ),&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in a report. SG GRM in diesel improved by $5.8/bbl (billion barrel) on quarter to $10.9/bbl. GRM&rsquo;s pf ATF (aviation turbine fuel) has improved $4.9/bbl QoQ to $10.3/bbl. The improvement was aided by festive season demand in Asia and increased air travel in the western nations, respectively. Naphtha prices increased to $81.7/bbl from $73.6/bbl in Q2FY22, with cracks improving to $3.4/bbl from $1.9/bbl in Q2FY22. An increase in petchem prices (due to power rationing measures in China, which led to shutdowns at some units) aided deltas for PE (polyethyline) and PVC (polyvinyl chloride) by 13 percent and 32 percent respectively on a quarterly basis (-3 percent and 24 percent YoY), while PP (polypropylene) was flat QoQ and down 16 percent YoY. Motilal Oswal expects consolidated EBITDA to grow 39 percent YoY and 15 percent on quarter to Rs 30,000 crore with the EBITDA of O2C business coming in at Rs 15,000 crore, a growth of 73 percent on-year and 21 percent on-quarter. The EBITDA for its telecom business is expected to grow 17 percent YoY and 5 percent QoQ to Rs 9,500 crore, while retails is expected to post another quarter of strong growth with its EBITDA growing 41 percent YoY and 31 percent QoQ to Rs 3,600 crore. The brokerage expects a 16 percent on-year growth in PAT at Rs 15,300 crore, a sequential growth of 8 percent. International brokerage JP Morgan expects strong recovery in refining and E&amp;amp;amp;P (exploration and production) to drive earnings growth. &ldquo;Overall the two key components of the company&rsquo;s refining margin slate, diesel and jet kero have seen cracks improving as transportation has picked up,&rdquo; the brokerage said in its report. Cracks for the two critical products should continue to improve in CY22 as transportation picks up further, the near-term Omicron impact notwithstanding, it said. JP Morgan expects strong growth in retails business while telecom and petchem are expected to remain steady. The company&rsquo;s SG GRMs may improve from $5/bbl in the previous quarter to over $8/bbl in this quarter, it said, estimating the consolidated EBITDA at Rs 28,259 crore with a sequential growth of 9 percent and a YoY growth of 31 percent. Net profit is pegged at Rs 15,033 crore with an on-year growth of 15 percent and a sequential growth of 10 percent. Kotak Institutional Equities also expects strong growth across businesses and forecasts a growth of 55 percent in consolidated revenues at Rs 1.80 lakh crore, a sequential growth of 7.5 percent. It expects an EBITDA of Rs 28,000 crore with a YoY growth of 30 percent and a sequential growth of 7.8 percent. &ldquo;We expect RIL&rsquo;s standalone EBITDA to increase by 15 percent QoQ reflecting (1) improvement in underlying refining and petchem margins and (2) likely higher volumes for both segments,&rdquo; Kotak said in a report. Apart from this, it expects EBITDA for (1) Jio to increase 4 percent QoQ led by higher ARPUs, which will be partly offset by rising costs and (2) for retail to increase by 27 percent QoQ driven by sustained strong rebound in demand during festive season. PAT is expected at Rs 14,820 crore for the quarter at a YoY growth of 12.1 percent and 8.4 percent QoQ. The stock of Reliance Industries closed at Rs 2,477.5, down Rs 44.1 (1.75 percent) from its previous close, on the National Stock Exchange on January 20. The stock is up 21 percent during the past one year and has generated returns of 9 percent during the past one month."

The financial sector reclaimed its position as the No. 1 wealth creator while public sector undertakings recorded their worst performance in 2016-21, the Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study showed. The financial sector was both the top wealth creating and top wealth destroying sector.  Equity was the biggest wealth creating asset class of the year as stock markets the world over created history by reaching record highs. The market-capitalisation of most companies and benchmark indices skyrocketed, first-time investors got attracted to the stock markets, and unprecedented liquidity was available in the market.  Adani Transmission emerged as the fastest wealth creator and Adani Enterprises the best all-round wealth creator.  Motilal Oswal found that the Top 100 companies in India&rsquo;s equity markets created Rs 71 lakh crore in wealth during the five years from 2016 to 2021. This was the highest wealth created in the past 26 five-year periods. The pace of wealth creation was also robust at a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent vis-&agrave;-vis 14 percent for the BSE Sensex.  The previous best period in terms of wealth creation was 2014-19, when the markets generated Rs 49 lakh crore of wealth for investors. The five-year period of 2015-20 was impacted by the pandemic and created Rs 21 lakh crore of investor wealth.  The Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2021, was released on December 15. The firm&rsquo;s wealth creation study was commissioned by Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Group.  Reliance rules the roost  Reliance Industries, the largest Indian company by market capitalisation, smashed all records to emerge as the largest wealth creator for the third time in a row. It added Rs 9.7 lakh crore to investor wealth, beating its own previous record of Rs 5.6 lakh crore during 2014-19. The company accounted for 13.6 percent of the total wealth created during the period.  &ldquo;Reliance&rsquo;s re-emergence as the biggest wealth creator reflects the power of phygital &ndash; physical plus digital,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in the report. &ldquo;Its oil-to-chemicals and retail businesses are strongly rooted in the physical whereas the telecom business is the digital dimension. Going forward, expect more and more phygital and digital companies to spearhead wealth creation.&rdquo;  IT giant&nbsp;Tata Consulting Services&nbsp;came in second by creating wealth of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, followed by&nbsp;HDFC Bank,&nbsp;which added Rs 5.2 lakh crore,&nbsp;Hindustan Unilever&nbsp;Rs 3.4 lakh crore and Infosys Rs 3.3 lakh crore.  Bajaj Finance,&nbsp;ICICI Bank,&nbsp;HDFC,&nbsp;Kotak Mahindra Bank&nbsp;and&nbsp;HCL Technologies&nbsp;made up the remaining top 10 wealth creators for 2016-21.  Reliance also made its entry into the list of top 10 fastest wealth creators, an area which is ruled predominantly by mid and small cap companies.  Adani Group &ndash; fastest in the race  The study found Adani Transmission&nbsp;was the fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 93 percent during 2016-21. Another Adani Group company &ndash;&nbsp;Adani Enterprises&nbsp;&ndash; was ranked the third fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 86 percent, behind&nbsp;Deepak Nitrite,&nbsp;which had a price CAGR of 90 percent.  Tanla Platforms&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ruchi Soya&nbsp;were the other two companies in the top five fastest wealth creators.  A sum of Rs 10 lakh invested equally in 2016 among the top 10 fastest wealth creators would have grown to Rs 170 lakh in 2021, which is a CAGR of 77 percent compared with 14 percent for the Sensex, according to the study.  &ldquo;For high wealth creation, it is essential to pick small-to-mid companies with robust earnings growth prospects trading at reasonable valuations,&rdquo; the study highlighted.  Adani Enterprises also emerged as the most consistent wealth creator in the past five years with the highest price CAGR of 86 percent.  Sectoral Participation  The financial sector emerged as the biggest wealth creating sector during 2016-21 by generating Rs 17.4 lakh crore. The sector lost its numero uno position last year to consumer &amp;amp;amp; retail, which came in at third position this year with Rs 12.5 lakh crore. Technology occupied the second position by adding Rs 15.2 lakh crore.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and metals &amp;amp;amp; mining made up the remaining list of top five biggest wealth creating sectors.  Led by rapid adoption of cloud, transformation and digitisation, the technology sector is witnessing robust demand and a strong deal pipeline, which will lead to high growth for the sector.  &ldquo;It is the only sector which may potentially challenge the dominance of the financial sector in the next wealth creation study period, 2017-2022,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said.  PSUs lose the plot  Public sector undertakings (PSUs) came up with their worst performance in the wealth creation process in 2016-21. Only Gujarat Gas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Indraprastha Gas could make it to the top 100 wealth creators, generating less than 1 percent of the total wealth.  The previous period of 2015-20, there were seven PSUs in the top 100, with 3 percent of the total wealth created. The study also found out that there were five PSUs in the top 10 wealth destroying companies. Private banks were the top wealth creators while public sector banks made up the top wealth destroyers.  Digital &ndash; the way to go  The wealth creation report highlighted that digital will be the mantra of the future.  &ldquo;Globally, value is migrating from atoms (businesses dealing in physical matter) to bits (businesses that are digital in nature),&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;This has already played out in a big way in the US.&rdquo;  The digital ecosystem in India is right for atoms-to-bits to play out here, it said.  According to the report, bits deal in intangible assets, have very low cost of replicating their products, and benefit from network effects.  &ldquo;As a result, bits can scale up very rapidly compared to their atom counterparts,&rdquo; the report added.  Bits have high initial losses and their success depends on hyper growth, operational scalability, large opportunity size, favourable unit economics, wide distribution and network effects.

The retail business saw strong recovery and performed well.,,"Reliance Industries, Result Analysis",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/result-analysis/reliance-q2-results-satisfy-as-retail-shines_15661061.html,"Reliance Industries' (RIL) September quarter results (Q2FY22) are broadly in line with analysts' estimates, and have even outperformed on some parameters. The company&rsquo;s consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased by 11 percent vis-&agrave;-vis the June quarter (Q1FY22) to Rs 26,020 crore. This represents a 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) EBITDA growth.  Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a report on October 22, &ldquo;RIL's Q2 EBITDA was in line with Jefferies estimates (JEFe) on beat in Retail, in line O2C and miss in Jio.&rdquo; O2C refers to RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemical segments.  The broker further added, &ldquo;EBITDA was up 11 percent quarter-on-quarter with Jio 1&nbsp;percent below JEFe, Reliance Retail (RR) 6&nbsp;percent ahead of JEFe and O2C in line with JEFe.&rdquo;  With the restrictions easing after the second covid-19 wave, the retail business saw a strong recovery. RIL&rsquo;s Q2 retail revenues have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Core retail revenue growth stood at 16 percent YoY. The business saw a meaningful improvement in store operating hours to 89 percent in September versus 38 percent in June.  Footfalls have recovered to 78 percent of pre-pandemic levels compared to 46 percent in Q1. The company saw strong growth in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle with record quarterly sales in apparel &amp;amp;amp; footwear category. New stores added in Q2 stood at 813, which is far higher than 123 stores added in Q1.  On the other hand, Reliance Jio&rsquo;s performance was a tad underwhelming. The firm saw a churn of low-end subscribers owing to the pandemic&rsquo;s impact, driving a net decline of 11.1 million in customer base in Q2. &ldquo;A repeat of Jio's Q2 subscriber performance in Q3 will definitely dampen hopes of a tariff hike over the next few quarters.  For now, we will closely watch the JioPhone Next launch and its impact on Jio's net subscriber additions,&rdquo; said Jefferies&rsquo; analysts in another report. To an extent, better ARPU (average revenue per user) compensated for the subscriber performance. In Q2, ARPU stood at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, representing a 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Centrum Broking Ltd analysts said in their first cut note, &ldquo;Retail and Telecom now forms approx. 48 percent of consolidated EBITDA versus around 32/40 percent in FY20/21. With the continued reopening across the country from June driving a strong return to normalcy H2FY22 will see much stronger numbers from both these segments, in our opinion.&rdquo;  Meanwhile, RIL&rsquo;s O2C business performance was decent last quarter. Revenues grew 58 percent YoY mainly on account of better realizations driven by the increase in oil prices and higher volumes. O2C EBITDA increased by around 44 percent year-on-year and 4 percent sequentially.  Overall, RIL&rsquo;s profit after tax (PAT) in Q2 increased by 46 percent YoY and 12 percent quarter-on-quarter. Centrum Broking&rsquo;s analysts said, &ldquo;RIL adjusted consolidated EBITDA/ PAT at Rs 26000 crore/ Rs 15500 crore, beat Centrum&rsquo;s estimated EBITDA/ PAT of Rs24800 crore/ 14600 crore as retail revived strongly with higher margins (retail EBIT +66&nbsp;percent quarter-on-quarter).&rdquo;  Ahead of the results announcement on Friday, the RIL stock closed marginally higher at Rs 2,627.40 per share on the National Stock Exchange. Some analysts expect the growth outlook to be strong. JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd expects a strong free cash flow generation phase with major capex completed and strong 17-18&nbsp;percent earnings per share CAGR likely over the next three-five years. CAGR is the compound annual growth rate.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

All businesses&nbsp;recorded growth over pre-Covid levels with the digital services segment having a record quarterly business in Q2.  Profit in the year-ago period was at Rs 10,602 crore and Rs 13,806 crore in June 2021 quarter. The sequential growth in profit was 12.1 percent.  Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs&nbsp;1.74 lakh crore, significantly higher by 49.8 percent compared to Rs 1.16&nbsp;lakh crore reported in the year-ago period, said Reliance Industries in its BSE filing, adding the topline growth on a sequential basis was 20.6 percent.  &amp;quot;Reliance has posted a strong performance in Q2FY22. This demonstrates the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies. All businesses reflect growth over pre-Covid levels,&amp;quot; said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani in a statement.  He further said the operational and financial performance reflected a sharp recovery in the retail segment and sustained growth in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and digital services business.  &amp;quot;O2C business benefited from sharp recovery in demand across products and higher transportation fuel margins. Reliance Retail continues to grow on the back of rapid expansion of both physical stores and digital offerings resulting in healthy growth in revenues and margin expansion,&amp;quot; Ambani added.  He said Jio, the digital services business, continued to transform the broadband market in India and set new benchmarks for the industry.  The standalone profit of the company grew by 44.1 percent to Rs 9,228 crore and gross revenue increased by 68.8 percent to Rs 1.08 lakh crore YoY in Q2.  The operating performance was also strong during the quarter, with record consolidated EBITDA at Rs 30,283 crore for the quarter, growing 30 percent YoY.  Jio Platforms  The telecom business reported quarterly operating revenue at Rs 19,777 crore, a growth of 15.1 percent YoY (adjusted for interconnection usage charge&nbsp;or IUC), driven by continued subscriber traction in the connectivity business, with&nbsp;average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, which is a healthy 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Jio, which continued to hold the top position in 4G coverage and availability, had a customer base of 429.5 million at the end of September 2021, a net addition of 23.8 million customers YoY.  Its net profit grew by&nbsp;a massive 23.5&nbsp;percent YoY to Rs 3,728 crore and EBITDA increased by 16.6 percent to Rs 9,294 crore in the quarter ended September 2021.  Retail Business  Reliance Retail&nbsp;delivered strong performance with revenue from operations growing 9.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 39,926 crore in September 2021 quarter which saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer&nbsp;sentiments amid festivities, relaxations in Covid related curbs and vaccinations.  &amp;quot;The business re-established growth momentum in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle with sales closing above pre-Covid levels. Consumer electronics and grocery maintained strong growth momentum,&amp;quot; the company said.  Retail business profit for the quarter at Rs 1,695 crore grew by 74.2 percent, with&nbsp;EBIDTA growth of 45.2 percent YoY at Rs 2,913 crore, driven by favourable revenue mix, and continued focus on cost management and investment income, said the company, adding&nbsp;EBITDA margin expanded by 180 bps&nbsp;YoY driven by strong operating leverage.  Oil-To-Chemicals Business  The O2C business sustained growth momentum, registering a&nbsp;58.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.2 lakh crore&nbsp;primarily due to improved realisation on the back of increase in oil prices and higher volumes.&nbsp;Refinery throughput increased by 11.8 percent YoY to 17.1 MMT (million metric tonnes)&nbsp;during the quarter.  Crude prices were lifted higher by tighter supply amid multiple production outages, lowering in uptick&nbsp;of Covid infections and higher overall throughput.&nbsp;Brent crude averaged $73.5&nbsp;a barrel in Q2FY22, up by $4.6&nbsp;QoQ and&nbsp;$30.5 YoY).  Reliance said O2C business EBITDA improved by 43.9 percent YoY to&nbsp;Rs&nbsp;12,720 crore primarily on account of better transportation fuel cracks, higher intermediates product deltas, efficient product placement and yield management. However, &amp;quot;EBITDA margin for the quarter declined by 100bps YoY to 10.6 percent due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&amp;quot; it noted.  Solar Energy Business  Reliance Industries has increased its focus on solar energy segment as it is going to establish and enable up to 100 GW of solar energy in India by 2030, and become a global player in the renewable industry.  &amp;quot;We continue to make steady progress in accelerating foray into new energy and new materials business. Our partnership approach and the desire to bring India to the forefront of global transition to clean and green transition is underscored by recent investments in some of the best companies in the world in the solar and green energy space,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  &amp;quot;I am now even more confident of achieving ambitious target of Net Carbon Zero by 2035,&amp;quot; he added.  Recently its subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL) acquired 86,887 series C preferred shares of Germany's NexWafe GmbH at a price of EUR 287.73 per share for 25 million euros. NexWafe is developing and producing monocrystalline silicon wafers.  Reliance New Energy Solar also decided to acquire 40 percent stake in Sterling &amp;amp;amp; Wilson Solar, which executed 11-plus GW of solar turnkey projects globally, through a combination of primary investment, secondary purchase and open offer. Moreover, it acquired REC Solar Holdings AS, one of the world's leading solar cells / panels and polysilicon manufacturing company, from China National Bluestar (Group) Co Ltd, for an enterprise value of $771 million.  In the retail segment, its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures though 7-India Convenience Retail entered into a master franchise agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. for launch of 7-Eleven convenience stores in India.  With effect from September 1, Reliance Retail Ventures had taken sole control of Just Dial,&nbsp;India's&nbsp;leading local search engine platform which provides search-related services to users across India.

The Reliance stock price hit a record high of Rs 2,750 on the BSE on October 19, with a market capitalisation of almost Rs 18.3 lakh crore. The stock had a strong run-up recently after the company signed several deals in the solar energy business. It has gained 24 percent since the beginning of July.  The September quarter earnings, to be declared on October 22, will likely decide the direction of the stock price.  Experts said Reliance&rsquo;s retail and digital businesses, which accounted for 32.4 percent and 18.5 percent of total revenue, respectively, could be the stars in the September quarter, driving double-digit growth in every earnings parameter.  &ldquo;Retail and digital business will post a strong recovery,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in its earnings preview. The brokerage, which has a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; call on the stock, expects consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 24 percent YoY, driven by the retail and digital businesses, and revenue growth of 34 percent YoY.  Motilal Oswal expects the oil-to-chemical segment&rsquo;s EBITDA to grow by 39 percent, Reliance Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA to increase by 21 percent, and retail EBITDA to grow by 38 percent from a year earlier.  Yes Securities expects&nbsp;Reliance to report better earnings (QoQ and YoY) on improved retail profitability and refinery margins.  The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) was at $3.7 a barrel, the highest in the past seven quarters, improving further QoQ in Q2 of FY22, led by better gasoline, aviation turbine fuel and naphtha cracks amid hurricane-led supply disruptions, said Motilal Oswal. GRM is a measure of&nbsp;the amount that refiners earn from turning each barrel of crude oil into fuel products.  Brent crude prices averaged $73 a barrel in Q2, a jump of about 70 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ, due to supply-side disruptions and inventory shortages. This despite OPEC+ easing production cuts starting in August. Recent hurricanes in the US have taken out more than 25 million barrels of offshore production, said Motilal Oswal.  Brent prices have been increasing and crossed $86 a barrel on October 21 for the first time since October 2018. The rally in prices is largely because of expectations of strong global growth, power outages mainly in China, and supply concerns.  Kotak, too, expects strong earnings growth at Reliance for the quarter, with consolidated profit rising 38.3 percent, EBITDA up 35.1 percent and revenue increasing 32.1 percent YoY.

Disclosing the results of shareholder votes on the appointment, Reliance in a regulatory filing said 98.03 per cent of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to appoint Al-Rumayyan for three years.  As many as 10.89 crore shares or 1.96 per cent voted against the resolution, while 3.23 crore votes were declared invalid due to lack of proper authorisation, it said.  The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), a shareholder of Reliance, had last month decided to vote against the move based on US proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation.  CalSTRS decided to oppose the appointment due to Al-Rumayyan's position in Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its governor, as well as in Aramco.  PIF has already invested Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail and Rs 11,367 crore in RIL's Jio Platforms. Also, Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in Reliance's oil-to-chemical business.  Reliance had, however, rejected conflict of interest allegations saying, &amp;quot;The appointment of Yasir Al Rumayyan has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco&amp;quot;.  The O2C business of RIL is being spun off to a subsidiary.  &amp;quot;As per the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,&amp;quot; it added.  As of June 30, 2020, CalSTRS held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of RIL, according to its website. CalSTRS is America's second-largest public pension fund with assets totalling approximately USD 318.4 billion as of August 31, 2021.  CalSTRS's opposition was based on a report by Glass, Lewis &amp;amp;amp; Co, an American proxy advisory services company. According to Glass, Lewis &amp;amp;amp; Co, since Al-Rumayyan has a key role in the operations of Aramco and PIF, he does not qualify to be an independent director.  Under Indian law, an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the firm that intends to appoint him or her.

Of these, more than 50 have already begun including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, an initiative of Geneva-based WEF, in their mainstream financial and regulatory reporting. These include PayPal, PwC, Petronas, S&amp;amp;amp;P, Salesforce, Total and Yara International.  The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The project's twin objectives are to accelerate convergence among the leading private ESG standard-setters and to bring greater comparability and consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures.  During its ongoing Sustainable Development Impact Summit, the WEF said that the international support is growing for the stakeholding capitalism metrics initiative with more than 50 companies having begun reporting these metrics in their 2020-2021 filings, while over 100 have shown support for this initiative so far.  The summit brings together global leaders from business, government, and civil society under the theme 'Shaping an Equitable, Inclusive and Sustainable Recovery'.  Those having committed to such reporting include Accenture, Allianz, Bank of America, Dell, Deloitte, EY, HEINEKEN, IBM, Mahindra Group, Mastercard, Nasdaq, Nestle, Reliance Industries, UBS, Unilever and Wipro.  Drawn from existing standards, the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics provide a set of metrics that can be reported on by all companies, regardless of industry or region, the WEF said.  The metrics also offer comparability, which is particularly important for informing ongoing efforts to create a systemic, globally accepted set of common standards for reporting on sustainability performance.  &amp;quot;We are delighted to see so many companies joining this effort and, even more so, excited to see many already implementing the metrics into their reporting,&amp;quot; WEF Managing Director Olivier Schwab said.  &amp;quot;This is the first time we have publicly seen this breadth of data from global companies across sectors on ESG factors. The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are already demonstrating that consistent and comparable ESG reporting can help articulate to stakeholders the collective contribution of ESG commitments,&amp;quot; Schwab added.  An early analysis of reports already incorporating the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in mainstream reporting demonstrates that it is now easier to consistently measure individual company progress against critical ESG areas, as well as the collective impact of those companies committed to reporting the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.  An initial analysis of the first 45 reports from companies shows how companies are building skills for the future, with over USD 1.5 trillion invested in training.  They also indicate that companies are innovating for better products and services, with over USD 20 trillion spent on R&amp;amp;amp;D and USD 23 trillion in cumulative multi-year innovation investments. They are also contributing to their communities and social vitality with nearly USD 140 trillion in taxes.  The WEF said companies have also faced some challenges reporting on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. These include data accessibility, jurisdictional challenges and data-processing capabilities.  Despite these challenges, corporate support for ESG reporting and the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative continues to grow and the Forum will continue to invite all of its partners to join this initiative, it added.

International Climate Summit 2021: Here is the full text  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,  Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri. Bhupender Yadav ji,&nbsp; Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Power and New &amp;amp;amp; Renewable Energy Shri Raj Kumar Singh ji, Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Science and Technology Shri Jitendra Singh ji,&nbsp; Member Energy NITI Aayog Dr. V K Saraswat,&nbsp; Former Executive Director International Energy Agency, Mr. Nobuo Tanaka Chairman Greenstat India, Mr. Sturle Pedersen Other distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning to all of you.  It is my privilege to deliver the inaugural address at the International Climate Summit - 2021 before this august audience.  I am delighted to see that this conference is bringing together leading policymakers, industrialists, investors, and scientists to discuss climate change and clean energy.  This Summit is taking place against the backdrop of a historic announcement by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on August 15.  In his address to the nation on the 75th Independence Day, he launched the Green Hydrogen Mission for India.  The fact that he chose &ldquo;Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav&rdquo; to make this announcement has sent a powerful message to both Indians and the rest of the world.  In my view, the message is two-fold:  One, India is determined to achieve azadi from dependence on fossil energy and become atma-nirbhar in New and Renewal Energy.  Two, India will make its fullest contribution to the global effort for achieving the goals and targets of Climate Action.  Dear Friends,  Climate Change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today. The world is witnessing with alarming frequency the disastrous effects of global warming. Glaciers are retreating. Mean sea level is rising.  Extreme and unpredictable weather changes are becoming regular. Ecological damage is becoming stark. Indeed, Climate Change, if uncontrolled, can threaten the very existence of life on our planet. Therefore, it is not enough to make our economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  We have only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. Because Climate Change is a global problem, the clean energy transition calls for the widest possible global cooperation in technology development, investments and fair market access.  Ladies and gentlemen,   While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India for another reason. Most of our present energy demand is met by imported fossil fuels costing us 160 billion USD every year.&nbsp; Although India&rsquo;s per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world&rsquo;s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  India&rsquo;s energy needs will increase exponentially as our economic growth accelerates to fulfil the aspirations of 1.38 billion people. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  Both India and the world are thus facing an unprecedented challenge. However, every challenge in human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress.  Dear Friends,  I am convinced that Climate Change is an opportunity for human civilisation to renew itself in the 21st century&hellip; An opportunity to create a healthier, happier, more secure and more resilient future for the human race&hellip;  A future in which there will be greater harmony between Man and Mother Nature. This opportunity for civilizational renewal will be realised by New and Renewable Energy. If Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy will provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation.  As a matter of fact, a New GREEN REVOLUTION has already begun in India. The Old Green Revolution made India self-reliant in food production. The New Green Revolution will help make India self-sufficient in energy production.  It is a matter of great pride for all of us that India has now achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy. India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for Renewable Energy.  The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight. &nbsp;The entire world will applaud India&rsquo;s singular achievement under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister.  Dear Friends,  I take this opportunity to share with you my perspectives on how India can become a global leader in Green Energy Revolution in the years to come. The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources.&nbsp; Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land.  Solar is perfectly suited to decentralised energy production, which in turn can promote decentralised socio-economic development. By investing in smart, two-way grids, micro-grids, efficient storage solutions and smart meters, we can enable individuals, communities and neighbourhoods to become both consumers and producers of energy.  These installations can be located close to demand. They have low maintenance requirements.&nbsp; Importantly, they have little environmental impact and entail zero human displacement problems. The rapid fall in the cost of production has made solar energy highly competitive, attracting large-scale investments.  This shall play a key role in ensuring similar growth trends in &ldquo;Green Hydrogen&rdquo; &ndash; the future replacement of fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen is a zero-carbon energy. It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world&rsquo;s decarbonisation plans. Green hydrogen is key to our ever green, sustainable and prosperous future of everyone on the planet  Hydrogen has high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions. Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years.  New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution. Furthermore, the Government of India is planning to create an enabling Green Hydrogen eco-system in the country. Because of all these developments, Green Hydrogen will surely attract significant investments.  Dear Friends,  Reliance Industries is fully committed to realising the vision of our Hon&rsquo;ble Prime Minister to fuel India&rsquo;s Green Economy using clean energy. Last year I had announced our ambitious commitment to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the New Energy Business, which will be the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. This complex will have four Giga Factories, which cover the entire spectrum of renewable energy. The first will be an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. The second will be an advanced energy storage battery factory. &nbsp;The third will be an electrolyser factory for the production of Green Hydrogen.  The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. Over the next three years we will invest 75,000 crore rupees in these initiatives.&nbsp; Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to India and Indians.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has set the goal to reach 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030.&nbsp; This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption.  This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India. Efforts are on globally to make Green Hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under USD 2 per kg.&nbsp; Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade.  And India has always set and achieved even more audacious goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under USD 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade &ndash; the 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen.  India has achieved several goals that seemed impossible over the years. I am sure this 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen will also be achieved by our talented young entrepreneurs, researchers and innovators.  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,  You are the architect of a New India. Your vision of New India is propelled by New and Renewable Energy. It will create millions of new and high-value green jobs for our youth. It will give a big boost to green enterprises in India, who can proudly proclaim: &ldquo;Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!&rdquo;.  It will transform India from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Energy solutions. It will also bridge the green energy divide in India and globally. I am certain that, under your dynamic leadership, India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a People&rsquo;s Movement.  On behalf of all my colleagues in the Indian industry, on behalf of Reliance and on my own behalf, I pledge full support and commitment to your vision and mission.  Thank you.  &nbsp;Disclaimer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary."

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate will announce its Q1FY22 results on July 23.  The company&rsquo;s retail and telecom businesses flourished in FY21, despite COVID-led disruptions, thanks to its aggressive growth philosophy, which mitigated the impact of the pandemic on the overall business and provided the much-needed capital raise and deleveraging.  Investors will be keen to see to what extent COVID-related macro headwinds had dented the retail and refining business of the company in the June quarter.  Kotak estimates adjusted PAT to grow 24.7% YoY  The estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities shows an 80.4 percent YoY jump in net sales while adjusted PAT may grow 24.7 percent YoY.

The brokerage firm expects an 8 percent sequential increase in standalone EBITDA, driven by higher&nbsp;margins from downstream business and an increase in contribution from the upstream segment.  Adjusted PAT may climb 23.8% YoY: Motilal Oswal  Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects consolidated EBITDA at Rs 22,800 crore, up 35 per cent YoY, led by the growth in the O2C (oil-to-chemical) business, while the retail business is likely to see a dip due to the second wave of COVID-19.  Motilal Oswal expects O2C EBITDA at Rs 10,800 crore, up 51 per cent YoY and RJio EBITDA at Rs 8,300 crore, up 18 per cent YoY. Retail EBITDA may come at Rs 1,700 crore, up 92 per cent YoY, said the brokerage firm.  As per the estimates of Motilal Oswal, RIL's Q1 net sales may rise 55 per cent while adjusted PAT may climb 23.8 per cent YoY.  Brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial Services expects a 60.6 per cent YoY jump in net sales of RIL, while PAT may rise 31.3 per cent YoY.

Aimed at taking on the likes of the other video conferencing apps like Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams, JioMeet was launched in 2020. This was during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that has been terrorising the world and most, if not all countries had issued lockdowns and public restrictions to contain the spread of the virus.  At the recently-concluded AGM, the sheer number of virtual attendees at more than 3.8 lakh proves the scalability of the app when it comes to conferencing. A statement released by Reliance reads, &ldquo;It was a proud moment for the team JioMeet to have successfully completed an event of this scale. This reemphasized on the world class engineering which has gone in making JioMeet so scalable and flexible.&rdquo;  The statement further adds, &ldquo;JioMeet is already one of India&rsquo;s most favorite video conferencing app with HD quality Audio and Video and how it has been built for Indian conditions. JioMeet has made huge in-roads into both retail and enterprise segments.&rdquo;  JioMeet has also been undergoing upgrades and has been adding features to better suit a conferencing environment in India. For example, along with a classroom and whiteboard mode, there is support for the Hindi language as well as support coming in the form of Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.  The JioMeet app is available on all platforms like Android and iOS as well as Mac, Windows and even for Set Top Boxes and has support for VC room connectivity.

It gives me great pleasure to greet you all at the 44th Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited.  It is the second year in a row that I miss the intimacy and warmth of face-to-face interaction with you, because of the COVID pandemic. However, the virtual format has enabled several lakhs of our shareholders to participate in the AGM from the safety of their homes.  Friends,  We are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. Its scale, severity and geographical spread are unseen in a century. It has filled the hearts of all Indians with enormous pain and grief.  Several of our employees and shareholders have borne the brunt of this pandemic. Within our one large Reliance Family, the suffering of any member becomes suffering of all.  Today, Nita, I, and my colleagues on the Board offer our heartfelt condolences to all those in our Reliance Family who have lost their loved ones to this pandemic.  I now request that all of us observe a minute of silence in memory of the departed souls.  Esteemed shareholders,  The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2021 have already been circulated to you. With your permission, I would like to take them as read.  Our business performance and financial success since the last AGM have exceeded our expectations, despite the pandemic. But I shall come to that later in my address.  What has given me far greater happiness than our business performance is Reliance's humanitarian efforts during these exceedingly difficult times. I feel both proud and humbled to share with you that throughout the COVID crisis, our Reliance Family has risen to the occasion with a sense of purpose and national duty. Our entire organisation has become energised with the spirit of service.  Every single employee has participated &ndash; directly or indirectly &ndash; in the Fight against COVID and become a Goodwill Ambassador of Reliance.  I am sure our efforts of the last one year would have made our Founding Chairman, Shri Dhirubhai Ambani, proud, because, the one common, unifying thread that runs through everything we have ever done at Reliance is the spirit of CARE and EMPATHY.  WE CARE for our Employees and their Families. WE CARE for our Customers, our Shareholders, and our Partners. WE CARE for the Country and the Community.  WE CARE for the Planet and the People.  This is what the true Reliance spirit was, is, and will always be. I now invite Isha, Akash and Nita to tell us about our COVID Missions of Reliance and the wonderful work done by all our colleagues.  1. Reliance Foundation and COVID Care  ISHA: Good afternoon everyone. I am Isha Ambani. AKASH: And I am Akash Ambani.  ISHA: Last AGM we were hopeful that by this time this year, the pandemic would be behind us. And yet, this is the second time that we are meeting virtually.These have been difficult times. But we have come together as a country, as a society, and as One Reliance family, to rise above them.  AKASH: Despite the challenges we have faced, when we look back at the year &ndash; we feel humbled &amp;amp;amp; inspired that each and every person in our Reliance family went out of their way to help one another, much beyond the call of duty.  ISHA: We know that had our grandfather been with us today, he would be proud. This is the Reliance he always wanted to see. One where each person did their very best to help those in need, and to be of service to our communities and our country.  Many of our Reliance family members have fought this battle from the frontlines - our retail store workers, telecom engineers, doctors, nurses, hospital staff. We have the deepest gratitude and highest admiration for each and every one of them.  AKASH: They ensured, our nation's fuel supplies are intact, digital connectivity is unaffected and daily essential needs of millions of people are met safely. We are indebted to them,for their service to our country, for their service to humanity.  ISHA: I'd like to share a couple of stories, to highlight what some of our colleagues have done in this time: One of our Jio engineers Mr Dave trekked 12 kms at 13,000 ft, in 10 ft of snow, through non-motorable roads, to restore digital connectivity in the Spiti Valley.  AKASH: When the cyclone hit Mumbai earlier this year, some of our Jio &amp;amp;amp; Retail stores faced indefinite power cuts. Our Store Manager Rupesh and so many others kept the stores running on minimum power consumption to ensure uninterrupted supplies to their customers.  ISHA: Many of our front line warriors contracted COVID themselves in the course of their duty but their selfless courage has inspired us every moment of this fight.  For over an year, Ricky Bindra, head of our Corporate Services, had been tirelessly organizing daily meals for the needy, setting up tie-ups for beds, medications, ventilators, oxygen, ambulances, and vaccinations for our entire Reliance Family.  Last month, Ricky and his family were diagnosed COVID positive. Ricky himself was in the ICU for 30 days, completely paralysed for 20 days, on a ventilator for 10 days, but by the grace of God, he is ok and on the road to rehab &amp;amp;amp; recovery now.  Our salute to Ricky, and countless other members of our Reliance family, who have placed their country first, community next, family third, and self last in this hour of need. They are our real-life super-heroes.  AKASH: Thanks to their spirited efforts, millions of our fellow Indians have continued to work from home, shop from home, learn from home, and consult doctors from the safety of their homes, in these tough times.  Our colleagues personify the DNA of Reliance - to CARE, UNITE, INTEGRATE, &amp;amp;amp; EMPOWER.  ISHA: Truly Akash! And to tell us more about Reliance Family's unified and tireless response to this crisis, Let us now welcome the Founder-Chairperson of the Reliance Foundation, our dearest mother, Mrs Nita Ambani!  Thank you, Isha &amp;amp;amp; Akash. Esteemed Shareholders, Namaskar.  I hope that all of you and your loved ones are well and safe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a humanitarian crisis. It has tested the very spirit of humanity. But even in the darkest hour, our spirit has shone bright. We as a people have come together, and fought this battle with immense empathy and compassion.  Reliance Foundation, over the last 11 years, has always stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of India, in every challenge big or small, through good &amp;amp;amp; bad times.  We have tried to make a difference to the lives of 45 million Indians across the country. In the remotest villages and towns of India, we have found and created stories of hope, of change, of transformation. And so last year, when humanity was struck with the worst crisis in over a 100 years,  we did our best to help in whichever way we could, and did so urgently. While our top priority this year was COVID relief, we ensured that we continued all our other developmental work as well.  We remained committed to our vision for Education and Sport for All. Within days of the outbreak, our 14 schools turned into digital schools. They became safe havens of positivity and learning for thousands of students who embraced virtual schooling with unimaginable enthusiasm!  We have also worked very hard through these challenging times, to bring our dream project &ndash; the Jio Institute &ndash; to life! Jio Institute is envisioned to be an exemplary academic institution with a world class platform for research, innovation, and lifelong learning. It will prepare the next generation of global leaders who will significantly contribute to the advancement of India and the world. Despite the pandemic, I am pleased to announce that Jio Institute is all set to commence academic sessions at their campus in Navi Mumbai this year itself!  This year we also launched Reliance Foundation Scholarships in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, for undergraduates and postgraduates.  Beyond education, sport has been another symbol of hope, a medium to delight and inspire the world in these times. In 2020, our champions Mumbai Indians brought in a lot of joy and cheer to millions, by winning their fifth IPL trophy! I wish our team all the best for the upcoming second leg of the IPL 2021.  Our football league ISL became the first, the longest, and the biggest sporting event to be held entirely in India with complete safety protocols, during the pandemic. It took more than 1600 people in 18 different bio-bubbles across 14 different locations in Goa, to pull off Season 7 of the Indian Super League very successfully.  Apart from cricket and football, we continue to focus on other sports like athletics, archery, basketball, badminton, and weightlifting. We have reached out to over 21.5 million children through our grassroots initiatives in various sports all across India. We hope to develop a holistic ecosystem that identifies and trains our young champions of tomorrow!  Speaking of champions, I would like to wish all our athletes of Team India the very best for the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games!  On a personal note, in December last year, Mukesh and I became proud grand-parents to our dearest Akash &amp;amp;amp; Shloka's precious baby boy Prithvi Akash Ambani! Thank you all for your good wishes &amp;amp;amp; blessings on this happy occasion in our family.  Friends,  I am a big believer in the phenomenal power of women. I believe that when women lean on women, incredible things happen. It is my dream and mission to empower every girl in India to write her own destiny.  On Women's Day in March this year, we launched a digital movement for women called Her Circle. Her Circle is an inclusive, collaborative, interactive, and socially-conscious digital platform. A circle of solidarity, sisterhood, and growth.  Reliance Foundation also partnered with USAID to launch the Women Connect India Challenge this year. A partnership that aims to empower more and more Indian women with digital reach and opportunity. Digital technology truly is the backbone of this new world order.  Using the power of digital, we also helped rural communities safeguard their lives and livelihoods from the natural calamities that affected India this year, be it the floods in Assam and Uttarakhand, or the cyclones on our eastern and western coast.  Friends,  Now I would like to take you through the work that Reliance Foundation is doing in our nation's fight against the pandemic. Over the past 15 months, for Mukesh and me, the top priority has been to do whatever we can to help our nation and our people in these difficult times.  Reliance Foundation launched FIVE Missions to fight the virus:  1. Mission Oxygen  2. Mission COVID Infra  3. Mission Anna Seva  4. Mission Employee Care  5. and Mission Vaccine Suraksha Let me start with Mission Oxygen.  As you know, India faced an acute shortage of oxygen as soon as COVID cases began to surge earlier this year. Reliance swung into action on a war footing immediately.  Traditionally, we have never produced medical grade liquid oxygen. Yet when the need arose, we repurposed our Jamnagar refinery within days, to produce high-purity medical grade liquid oxygen and, within two weeks, we ramped up production to a massive 1100 Metric Tonnes per day.  It would normally take over a year to set up a new medical grade oxygen plant of this capacity. But it was a super-human effort by our Reliance engineers, who put in more than 85,000 man-hours of work in less than 10 days to make it possible. They delivered what mattered the most, when it mattered the most!  You will feel proud to know that today Reliance is producing over 11% of India's medical-grade liquid oxygen, the highest by a single company at a single location. We are providing this Pran Vayu &ndash; oxygen &ndash; to one out of every 10 COVID patients in India&hellip; and offering this service to the nation FREE OF COST.  For Mukesh and me, and every member of our Reliance Family, this opportunity to serve humanity is the noblest of all noble causes.  Friends,  In the oxygen supply chain, we have addressed India's serious bottleneck of tankers. Reliance procured 100 new medical-grade oxygen tankers both from within India and other parts of the world, like Germany, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Netherlands, Belgium, Thailand, Indonesia, and put them into service within two weeks.  We also helped in installing Oxygen Generators in several hospitals across the country, to strengthen oxygen availability. I salute all our engineers, doctors, and frontline warriors for working selflessly &amp;amp;amp; tirelessly for Mission Oxygen.  Dear Shareholders,  The key to fighting the pandemic is a strong COVID care infrastructure.  That is what we have tried to achieve through Mission COVID Infra. Last year, within days of the coronavirus outbreak, we set up India's first dedicated 250 bedded COVID facility in Mumbai.  By the time the second wave hit us, we had set up additional 875 beds for COVID care in Mumbai alone. Across India, we created a total capacity of over 2000 beds for COVID care, all equipped to provide uninterrupted oxygen supply and totally free-of-cost treatment.  We also launched a COVID testing lab with a capacity of over 15,000 tests per day.  The entire medical fraternity are the Real Heroes of this fight. They have put their own lives at risk, to save others', day after day. They have stayed isolated and away from their families and loved ones, to care for us.They have worked long hours at a stretch wearing full PPE kits, but never complained.  They have compromised their own health, and gone way beyond their call of duty. Dr. Tarang, Dr. Darshana, Dr Vivek, Sister Aneta, Sister Agnes, Sister Kusum, Brothers Chandrashekhar and Omkar, Managers Akanksha and Kumkum, Shivam, Vikas, Trinette, Mayank, Mayuri,  and countless others&hellip;  They became like friends and families for patients in COVID wards, caring for them, cheering for them, sometimes singing &amp;amp;amp; dancing for them! Their bravery, their selflessness, and their large-heartedness is a tribute to humanity in its purest form.  As a community, we owe each and every front-line warrior a huge debt. With folded hands, I salute their spirit of care and sacrifice. A big thank you on behalf of all of us.  A heartfelt dhanyawad.  Friends,  In the early days of the lockdown, we launched Mission Anna Seva, our commitment to feed the needy, and we extended it to include cattle and stray animals. Today, this commitment has taken the form of the largest meal distribution programme undertaken by a corporate foundation anywhere in the world. We have so far provided more than 7.5 crore free meals to marginalised communities, daily-wage earners, and frontline workers across the country.  Dear Shareholders,  Our next mission &ndash; Mission Employee Care &ndash; is an expression of our care and concern for the most precious members of our extended family, our Reliance Family.  Sanskar aur Mulyoon ke adhar par, humara yeh vishaal reliance parivaar&hellip; humien taaqat deta hai, hausla deta hai, prerna deta hai&hellip; Uski har khushi mein hum saath hain, Aur uske har dukh mein hum hissedar hain...  When the pandemic started last year, literally overnight we migrated to a full-time work-from-home mode. Across Reliance, we made sure that no jobs, no salaries, no bonuses were cut due to COVID. All medical expenses were paid fully, and fully paid leaves were granted. It breaks our hearts that in spite of our best efforts, we lost some precious members of our Reliance Family to the pandemic. Nothing can fill the void they have left in our minds and hearts.  The entire Reliance Family stands in solidarity with their families, and shares their grief. We remain committed to their families' continued well-being and fulfilling the dreams that they saw together. Towards this end, Reliance will continue to:  - pay the deceased employee's salary to the family for the next five years;  - finance their children's education in India till graduation,  - and, ensure continuity of medical coverage to the family for life.  Additionally, a lump-sum amount of TEN lakhs will be provided to families of our off-roll employees who succumbed to COVID-19.  My prayers, thoughts, and deepest condolences are with every family who has lost a loved one. Om Shanti.  Dear friends,  Our fifth and most critical mission is 'Mission Vaccine Suraksha'.  Mass Vaccination is India's topmost and urgent priority now. It is the most reliable way out of this crisis. And to achieve this in the shortest possible time, the Government of India has recently allowed private enterprises and hospitals to join the effort. To help speed up the vaccination drive, we have set up 116 vaccinations centres in 109 cities across the country.  We have made the entire vaccination process very easy &amp;amp;amp; accessible on our physical/digital platform JioHealthHub with a click of a button, you can book a slot or download CoWin Certificates.  Reliance Foundation will offer this platform absolutely free of cost to all users. The platform has the ability to scale up to 1 lakh vaccinations a day, that's one crore vaccinations in 100 days. We are continuously working to further increase this number.  We hope to partner with other corporate and local authorities towards fulfilling the mission of vaccinating all Indians by the end of this year. As we speak, we are already testing this platform with our Reliance family.  We are currently vaccinating all 20 lakh of our Extended Family, including retired employees, partner company employees, and their families &ndash; free of cost. Reliance's Mission Vaccine Suraksha is one of the largest corporate vaccination drives in India.  Executing this Mission on a nationwide basis is a humongous task. But it is our dharma, our duty to every Indian, our promise of safety and protection. Our firm belief that together, we can, and we will overcome.  My dear shareholders,  It is so inspiring to see each and every member of the Reliance Family come together to do their bit and make a difference. And this journey is made even more fulfilling &ndash;  When we get a thank you message from a mother who recovers from COVID, and then reunites with her child, when a senior citizen blesses us for providing essentials at her doorstep, when a migrant family feels they are not alone in the city, when a doctor or nurse on duty can protect themselves as they receive the PPE in time, when a hungry stray dog feels human compassion, when a daughter stuck far away can provide for her old parents through digital solutions and children can continue learning and seeing their friends in virtual school.  These are moments that make you believe that we are in this fight together. And I assure you that in every challenge that India faces, Reliance Foundation has and will continue to stand with every Indian. Together, we shall overcome&hellip;as we always have.  Please take care, stay safe, stay healthy, and stay hopeful. Jai Hind!  Thank you.  Chairman Continues:  Thank you, Nita. Thank you, Isha and Akash.  Let us give a standing ovation to each and every member of Team Reliance for their exemplary commitment, devotion and resolve, for going beyond the call of duty in serving the society in its hour of greatest need. I indeed feel immense pride in leading such a team that combines excellence with empathy.  My Dear Shareholders,  I now turn to the Business and Financial Performance of your company for the Year 2020-21.  2. Business &amp;amp;amp; Financial Performance  I am happy to report that even in a challenging environment, your company's performance continued to be outstanding.  Our consolidated revenue was nearly Rs. 540,000 crore, with a sharp increase from our consumer businesses. Our consolidated EBITDA was nearly Rs. 98,000 crore, and almost 50% of the EBITDA was contributed by consumer businesses.  One of these consumer businesses, Retail, is only about a decade old. The other business, Jio, is only five years old.  Our net profit for the year was Rs. 53,739 crore, higher by 34.8% compared to the previous year. Despite the pandemic, we increased our dividends this year.  Dear Friends,  As India's largest business enterprise, Reliance's contribution to the Indian economy continues to remain unmatched.  At Rs. 1,45,143 crore (US$ 19.9 billion), we continue to be India's largest exporter accounting for 6.8% of India's total merchandise exports across 107 countries.  Even in this challenging environment, Reliance added nearly 75,000 new jobs in the past year. We are committed to creating and enabling large-scale employment opportunities, which is one of India's most urgent national tasks.  We continue to be India's highest payer of customs and excise duty in the private sector with payments of Rs. 21,044 crore. We are amongst the highest payers of GST and VAT at Rs. 85,306 crore.We are amongst the highest payers of Income Tax in the private sector paying Rs. 3,213 crore.  In FY 2021, Reliance successfully carried out the largest ever capital raise by any company globally in a year, notwithstanding the COVID challenges.  The capital raises exceeded Rs. 324,432 crore (USD 44.4 billion) through equity in Jio Platforms and Retail, Rights Issue and asset monetization. The investors included some of the best and marquee names across the world; across sovereign wealth funds, and private equity.  This capital raise is a strong vote of confidence by global investors in India's growth potential. It reflects their faith in the ability of your company's management to execute ambitious projects and long-term value creation plans.  We also rewarded the shareholders with the largest and the most successful Rights Issue ever by an Indian company.I am really delighted that our retail shareholders have made 4x returns in just one year on their rights shares.  All of these helped Reliance achieve a net debt-free balance sheet much ahead of March 2021, a promise I had made two years ago.  Dear friends,  Let me now talk about the performance of the individual businesses.  Jio Platforms is the leading digital company in India with leadership in wireless connectivity and unmatched suite of apps and platforms.  The consolidated revenues in the past year were Rs. 86,493 crore, with EBITDA of Rs. 32,359 crore. We had a net addition of 37.9 million subscribers during the year. We now serve over 425 million consumers on our network. We have revenue market leadership in 19 out of 22 circles.  Reliance Retail continues to be the undisputed leader in organised retailing in the country, with scale that is more than 6 times the next competitor.  Despite a challenging year, Retail had revenues of Rs. 153,818 crore, and EBITDA of Rs. 9,842 crore. We are by far the leader in each category &mdash; grocery, electronics and apparel.  Our O2C business faced unprecedented challenges as the beginning of the year was marked by severe economic contraction, leading to demand destruction and supply chain dislocations. We focussed on safe operations of all our facilities. We were probably the only company globally that operated its facilities at near full capacity and was profitable in every quarter.  Our consolidated revenues during the year were Rs. 320,008 crore, with EBITDA of Rs. 38,170 crore. We managed to maintain EBITDA margin at 11.9% despite volatility in both feedstock and product prices.  We operationalised the JV with bp in fuel retailing, using technology and innovation to deliver new customer value.  The demand and margin environment for petrochemicals had recovered to pre-COVID levels by March. I am confident that our O2C business will benefit from the strong global growth environment.  As an important part of this vision of achieving accelerated growth, we look forward to welcoming Saudi Aramco as a strategic partner in our O2C business.  Despite several challenges due to COVID-19, we have made substantial progress in the past year in our discussions. These discussions have been held in the spirit of mutual commitment to convert our long-standing relationship into a perpetual partnership.  This continued engagement and resolve from both sides, even during this pandemic, is a testimony of strong relationship between Saudi Aramco and Reliance. I expect our partnership to be formalised in an expeditious manner during this year, after obtaining required regulatory clearances.  In our E&amp;amp;amp;P business, bp and Reliance commenced production in KGD6 basin. Our JV brought two of our three toughest deep water gas projects to production. This has been accomplished in record time and set a new global benchmark for capital costs.  We are now on course to bring the third Deepwater MJ field onstream in the last quarter of 2022. Together we will produce 30 MMSCMD gas production by 2023. This will establish Reliance again as one of the largest producers of gas in India, meeting 20% of India's gas demand. E&amp;amp;amp;P will again be a source of significant value and sustained earnings growth over the next decade.  Dear Shareholders,  Today I am happy to inform you about a change in the Board of Reliance Industries Limited. Shri YP Trivedi has expressed his desire to retire from the Board. It is my duty to place on record our sincerest thanks to Trivediji. He joined our Board at the request of our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani in 1992.  On behalf of the entire Board and the shareholders, I would like to thank him from the bottom of all our hearts for his wise counsel and sage advice for nearly 30 years.  Respected Trivediji, we wish you continued good health and happiness. You are now 92 years young. May God bless you to become a Shatayushi &ndash; a centurion.  I am delighted to welcome H.E. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Chairman of Saudi Aramco and the Governor of the Public Investment Fund, to join the Board of Reliance Industries Limited as an Independent Director. He is one of the most renowned names in energy and finance globally.  I am sure that we will immensely benefit from his rich experience with one of the world's largest companies, and also one of the largest Sovereign Wealth Funds in the world.  His joining our Board is also the beginning of internationalisation of Reliance. You will hear more about our international plans in the times to come.  3. New Energy Business: Vision, Mission and Implementation Plan  Dear Shareholders,  Last year I had shared with you our vision to create the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India &ndash; our New Energy and New Materials business.  I had also announced our 15-year commitment to become net carbon zero by 2035. Today I am happy to present to you our ambitious strategy and roadmap for implementing this vision.  The world is entering a new energy era, which is going to be highly disruptive. The age of fossil fuels, which powered economic growth globally for nearly three centuries, cannot continue much longer. The huge quantities of carbon it has emitted into the environment have endangered life on Earth.  Our world has only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. The COVID pandemic has further put the climate issue in the crisis bucket.  Therefore, the global new energy agenda needs to move from dialogue to action, from commitment to urgent implementation on the ground. In reality, it is not enough to be carbon neutral; the world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  Last month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the first time presented a concrete global roadmap for the energy sector to remove all emissions by 2050. The roadmap calls for annual additions of solar Photovoltaic to increase global solar capacity from 737 GW in 2020 to about 5,000 GW by the end of 2030.  While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India and other developing nations for another reason. India is experiencing an Explosion of Aspirations  India's GDP per capita is around 2,000 dollars while the world average is around 12,000 dollars. India's power consumption per capita at present is only one third of global consumption.  This Wealth Disparity and Energy Disparity is unacceptable. Furthermore, the health, wellbeing and quality of life of every human being is in peril because of the polluted environment.  The only answer to these problems lies in Sustainable and Equitable Development in India and globally. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  How do we meet India's growing energy needs through domestic sources of energy, and not by importing carbon intensive fuels?  How do we do so in a self-reliant and affordable way which benefits 1.35 billion Indians?  These are the challenges that we face. I firmly believe that India can, India must, and India will meet these challenges.  Friends,  Today I would like to make three affirmations.  First: As one of the biggest energy markets in the world, India will play a leading role in transforming the global energy landscape.  Second: As a company always focused on growing businesses of the future, Reliance will provide leadership on the combined strength of our balance-sheet, talent, technology and proven project execution capabilities.  Third: Reliance will make its New Energy business a truly global business. In 2016, we launched Jio with the aim of bridging the Digital Divide in India.  Now, in 2021, we are launching our new energy business with the aim of bridging the green energy divide in India and globally. And we will do it &mdash; like we have always done &mdash; by getting our First Principles right.  First through Hyper-Integration: By integrating scientific knowledge with continuous technological innovation to build and operate truly integrated systems that deliver hyper-performance;  Second with a Robust business model: By building a model that catches the irreversible upward curve in the demand for green, clean and renewable energy in India and globally; and the downward curve in the cost of their production;  Third by Scale: By improving the efficiency, performance and life-cycle of our assets and operations to achieve total system optimisation and economics.  Friends,  I have no doubt that world-class talent will be the most critical resource for this new business. We have begun the process of attracting the best talent from across the world and put into place various key initiatives.  We have established the Reliance New Energy Council with some of the finest minds, globally. They will help us validate our strategies and embrace disruptive pathways to achieve our goals.  We are creating a coalition of partnerships with leading global universities, best technology companies and most promising start-ups in America, Europe, Australia and Asia. In addition, we shall leverage our existing strengths and capabilities in digitisation platforms and large-scale manufacturing.  Dear Shareholders,  I am happy to inform you that we have started work on developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest such integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. Jamnagar was the CRADLE OF OUR OLD ENERGY BUSINESS. Jamnagar will also be the CRADLE OF OUR NEW ENERGY BUSINESS. Allow me to take you through our 3-part plan.  The first part of our plan is to build Four Giga Factories.  These will manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the New Energy ecosystem. One, for the production of solar energy &mdash; we will build an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory.  Two, for the storage of intermittent energy &mdash; we will build an advanced energy storage battery factory. Three, for the production of green hydrogen &mdash; we will build an electrolyser factory.  Four, for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power &ndash; we will build a fuel cell factory.  Over the next 3 years we will invest over 60,000 crore rupees in these initiatives. Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem.  Friends,  Allow me to explain each of these facilities in some more detail.  Our first Integrated Solar Photovoltaic Giga Factory will create solar energy. We will start with raw silica and convert this to poly silicon which we will then convert to ingot and wafers. These wafers would be used to make high efficiency solar cells and finally assembled into solar modules of highest quality and durability.  We will target to achieve costs that are lowest in the world to ensure affordability of our solar modules. We are highly inspired by the goal set by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji for India to achieve 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.  Out of this, I am pleased to announce today, that Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030. A significant part of this will come from rooftop solar and decentralised solar installations in villages. These will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India.  Solar energy is available only during the day, while power is needed round the clock. Therefore, storage is an important piece of the puzzle to solve. For this, we will launch our second initiative &mdash; an Advanced Energy Storage Giga Factory.  We are exploring new and advanced electro chemical technologies that can be used for such large-scale grid batteries to store the energy that we will create. We will collaborate with global leaders in battery technology to achieve the highest reliability for round-the-clock power availability through a combination of generation, storage, and grid connectivity.  Besides Electricity, Green Hydrogen will be a unique energy vector that can enable deep decarbonization of many sectors such as transportation, industry and power. One of the most common methods of generating Green Hydrogen is by electrolysis of pure water through Electrolysers.  This brings me to our third initiative &mdash; an Electrolyser Giga Factory to manufacture modular electrolysers of highest efficiency and lowest capital cost. These can be used for captive production of green hydrogen for domestic use as well as for global sale.  And, finally, our fourth initiative will be the Fuel Cell Giga Factory. A Fuel Cell uses Oxygen from the air and Hydrogen, to generate electricity. The only emission of this process is non-polluting water vapour.  In the new era, Fuel Cells will progressively replace internal combustion engines. Fuel Cell engines can power automobiles, trucks and buses.They can also be used in stationary applications for powering data centres, telecom towers, emergency generators and micro grids and industrial equipment.  This brings me to the second part of our plan &ndash; providing infrastructure and materials to support the four Giga factories.  Our Jamnagar complex will provide infrastructure and utilities to manufacture ancillary material and equipment needed to support these Giga factories so that all critical materials are available in time. We will also support independent manufacturers with right capabilities to be part of this nationwide ecosystem.  We will invest an additional Rs. 15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries. Thus, our overall initial investment from our own internal resources in the New Energy business will be Rs. 75,000 (over $10 billion) crore in 3 years.  Now let me take you through the third part of our plan:  Over the years, Reliance has developed significant engineering, project management and construction capabilities combining physical and digital technologies.  We will repurpose these capabilities, along with major international organisations to execute and deliver world class, renewable energy solutions.  We will build two additional divisions to further strengthen this ecosystem. First, a dedicated Renewable Energy Project Management and Construction Division. Second, a dedicated Renewable Energy Project Finance Division.  The Renewable Energy Project Management and Construction Division will provide gigawatt scale end-to-end solutions for large renewable plants across the world. It will enable and partner with thousands of Green MSME Entrepreneurs, who can deploy kilowatt to megawatt scale solutions in agriculture, industry, residences and transportation.  The Renewable Energy Project Finance Division will provide finance solutions to the stakeholders in our ecosystem. We will achieve our goals by enabling a platform to source long-term global capital for these investments at the most attractive terms.  We will seek support from our relationship banks and global green funds for this purpose. Simultaneously, we will also facilitate a platform to provide financing for the entire ecosystem of small businesses and entrepreneurs who invest alongside with us.  All of these three parts together constitute our architecture for India's decentralised Green Economy. Over a period of time, it will generate millions of new and high-value job opportunities for our youth. With these new initiatives, Reliance will put Gujarat and India on world solar and hydrogen map.  All our products will proudly proclaim: Made in India, by India, for India and for the world! This will be Reliance's yet another big contribution to our Prime Minister's clarion call of Atmanirbhar Bharat.  I am certain that India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a  People's Movement.  Solar power is the primary source of energy for our Planet Earth. 'Soorya Dev' has blessed India with almost limitless sunlight.  I envision a future when our country will be transformed from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Solar Energy solutions.  Dear Friends,  Reliance is also evolving a vision for NEW MATERIALS and GREEN CHEMICALS. We will kickstart this by strategically investing in India's first world-scale CARBON FIBER plant for supporting our hydrogen and solar ecosystems. You will hear more about this in the months to come.  Our new Green Vision also has immense benefits for our existing O2C business. Allow me to take you through these:  First, we will use solar energy on an economically attractive basis to decarbonise our existing O2C business and accelerate our journey to become net carbon zero.  Second, we will use Green Hydrogen and CO2 as raw materials to develop a road map for new Green Chemicals, Green Fertilizer and e-fuels.  Third, we will commercialise with global partners our own world-beating proprietary Multi-zone Catalytic Cracking (MCC) Technology to optimise the fossil fuel transition to sustainable chemical and material building blocks.  Thus, we will transform our legacy business into sustainable, circular and net zero carbon materials business. One that will provide growing returns over several decades. And we will do this by repurposing our existing assets to extend their economic life and earning capacity. In doing so we will have no legacy asset write-downs in the coming years.  Dear Shareholders,  This twin execution plan of building a New Energy and materials ecosystem and decarbonising and repurposing our existing O2C business is a multi-decade growth path for our company. It has the potential to create unprecedented value for India and for Reliance in the coming years.  Dear Shareholders,  New Energy and New Materials are not merely another business for us.It is our mission to heal the environment. It is an expression of Reliance's commitment that WE CARE for our beautiful and bountiful planet.  By implementing our Green Vision, Reliance will help transition India and the World from an Industrial Civilisation to an Ecological Civilisation. We are repaying our debt of gratitude to Mother Nature.  Dear Shareholders,  Let me tell you, in all humility, that New Energy is the most exciting, most challenging and most purpose-driven mission I will be pursuing in my life. I seek your blessings and support for success in this mission.  4. Reliance Jio  Dear Friends,  Let me now turn to JIO, our digital services initiative.  In spite of COVID, JIO sustained its track record of robust performance. JIO became the first operator outside China to cross 400 million mobile subscribers in a single country.  We are truly grateful to all our valued customers. Thanks to them, JIO is today the world's second largest mobile data carrier handling monthly traffic of over 630 crore GIGABYTES.  This is nearly 45% growth in data consumption in the last year alone, a testament to the rapid pace at which India is digitizing.  More significantly, JIO continued to be the digital lifeline binding Indians together despite social distancing, lockdowns and working-from-home. During the past year, we also made the necessary capital investments to further strengthen our market position and growth.  During recent spectrum auctions, we invested Rs. 57,123 crore to acquire significant additional spectrum, making JIO the largest operator of 4G spectrum in India. And we have operationalized nearly 100% of this additional spectrum.  When combined with another Rs. 15,183 crore we invested in further expanding our network infrastructure, JIO has raised the bar even higher for service quality and JIO's leadership is evident across India along all key metrics like indoor coverage, download speeds and video experience.  More importantly these investments have also created the capacity to on-board an additional 200 million customers on JIO's network thereby bringing digital empowerment to even more Indians.  Friends,  JIO has truly democratized digital connectivity in India by offering the highest quality, most affordable 4G broadband  services in the world. Even so, India still has nearly 300 million mobile users who are unable to escape from inefficient and exorbitant 2G services because even a basic 4G smartphone remains unaffordable for these users.  Therefore, an ultra-affordable 4G smartphone is essential to make India &ldquo;2G-mukt&rdquo;. Last year, Sundar and I had talked about Google and JIO co-developing a next-generation, feature-rich, but extremely affordable smartphone, aimed at providing first-time internet access for 2G users.  Today, I am pleased to announce that Google and JIO teams have jointly developed a truly breakthrough Smartphone, that we are calling JIOPHONE Next.  JIOPHONE Next is a fully featured smartphone, supporting the entire suite of applications from both Google and Jio, as well as the Android Play Store through which users will have access to the entire universe of Android Apps.  JIOPHONE Next is powered by an extremely optimised version of the Android Operating System, that has been jointly developed by JIO and Google, especially for the Indian market.  While being ultra-affordable, JIOPHONE Next is packed with cutting-edge features like the voice assistant, automatic read-aloud of screen text, language translation, smart camera with augmented reality filters and much more.  This is a testimony to a global technology giant and a national technology champion working jointly to make a break- through product, that can be first introduced in India and then taken to the rest of the world.  JIOPHONE Next will be available in the market from the auspicious date of Ganesh Chaturthi, 10th September this year,  And as you have come to expect from Jio, it is my promise that JIOPHONE Next will be by far, amongst the most affordable smartphone not just in India, but globally.  Let me now invite my good friend Sundar to talk about JioPhone Next, and other areas of collaboration between Google and JIO.  Sundar Pichai Speech:  &ldquo;Thank you to Mukesh, Nita, Akash, and Isha - and to everyone at Reliance Industries for all you do for India&hellip;  From investing in infrastructure and technology... to creating jobs and expanding opportunity&hellip; to supporting communities in need, especially in this difficult moment for the country.  It's been devastating to see the country hit so hard by COVID-19. Yet it's heartening to see how Reliance has stepped up to contribute to the national response and get support to the communities that need it most.  On behalf of all of us at Google: we hope you are taking care...and are wishing for better days ahead.  For Google, the past year has brought renewed purpose and greater urgency to our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.  At a time when so many aspects of our lives and work are moving online, it's even more important to make technology accessible and helpful for everyone.  This goal is at the heart of our partnership with Reliance Jio. I was proud to help launch this partnership last year.  It was the first and biggest equity investment from the Rs. 75,000 crore Google for India Digitization Fund.  Our vision was to bring affordable access to information for Indians in their own language... to build new products and services for India's unique needs... and empower businesses with technology.  I'm excited that today, we can announce the next steps in this vision: Starting with a new, affordable, Jio smartphone, created with Google.  Our teams have optimised a version of our Android OS especially for this device. It will offer language and translation features, a great camera, and support for the latest Android updates.  It is built for India&hellip; And it will open up new possibilities for millions of new users who will experience the internet for the very first time&hellip;. And we can't wait to show you the device later this year.  I'm also proud to announce that we are taking our collaboration further&hellip; with a new 5G partnership between Google Cloud and Jio.  It will help more than a billion Indians connect to a faster and better internet... support businesses in their digital transformation&hellip; and help Jio build new services in sectors like health, education and more &mdash; laying a foundation for the next phase of India's digitization.  As part of this collaboration, Reliance will also shift its core retail businesses to Google Cloud's infrastructure.  They will be able take advantage of Google's AI and machine learning, ecommerce, and demand forecasting offerings.  Harnessing the reliability and performance of Google Cloud will enable these businesses to scale up as needed to respond to customer demand.  Empowering businesses as they embark on their digital transformation is a key part of our mission in India, and I'm excited for the innovations this partnership will help unleash.  We are proud to play a part in India's next wave of technological innovation.  Helping to connect 1.3 billion Indians to the opportunities the internet creates is meaningful to all of us at Google -- and certainly to me personally.  I know that with greater access to smartphones and improved connectivity, there's no limit to what India's people can do.  We look forward to getting technology into the hands of more people...and to exploring what more we can achieve together in the years ahead.  Thank you.&rdquo; Thank you, Sundar. We greatly value our partnership with Google. Friends,  As Sundar mentioned, Cloud and Cloud solutions, is another area where we are collaborating with Google. JIO will use Google Cloud's cutting-edge technologies to power JIO's 5G Solutions and for powering the internal needs of key Reliance growth businesses like Reliance Retail, JioMart, JioSaavn and JioHealth.  Friends,  We have also made significant progress in the collaborations that we announced last year.  Let me start with FACEBOOK - We have launched an initial set of integrations between WhatsApp and JioMart on a trial basis and the response from WhatsApp and JioMart customers is encouraging along with lots of valuable feedback. Our joint teams are actively developing the full New Commerce solution linking merchants and consumers, and we plan to progressively launch these over the next few quarters.  With MICROSOFT - We have operationalized an initial 10 MW capacity of JIO-AZURE Cloud Data centres in two cities, Jamnagar and Nagpur. We are currently onboarding the initial group of pilot customers and we plan to expand our data centre capacity and our offerings to a growing number of SMEs and start-ups over the coming quarters.  We are indeed privileged to have partners like Facebook, Google and Microsoft, in whose company, our efforts to create a DIGITAL SOCIETY in India seems that much easier.  Friends,  Across the world, the past 15 months have been challenging for on-the-ground physical work.  JIOFIBER, JIO's optical fiber-based, gigabit speed, fixed broadband services has also faced similar challenges. The pace of Optical fiber deployment, building-connectivity and home-installations have all been slower than expected because of lockdowns and other restrictions across our country.  Despite this, I am glad to announce that JIOFIBER has acquired more than 2 million new premises over the past year, following all safety protocols for our customers and employees. Now, with a cumulative base of 3 million active home and business users, JIOFIBER has become the largest and the fastest growing fixed broadband operator in India.  Data consumption on JIOFIBER has grown to more than 3.5 times compared to a year ago. Today, JIO's optical-fiber network is physically present outside more than 12 million homes and business premises, with a deep fiber footprint in the top 100 cities.  I continue to be confident of a rapid uptake of JIOFIBER services and revenue growth for JIO as India recovers from COVID.  Dear Shareholders,  I announced last year that JIO's engineers have developed a 100% home-grown and comprehensive 5G solution which is fully cloud native, software defined, and digitally managed.  Jio has taken tremendous strides in maturing this state-of-the-art Standalone 5G technology, which signifies a quantum leap to the next frontier of wireless broadband. Together with our partners, we have tested the JIO 5G solutions in India and we successfully demonstrated speeds well in excess of 1 GBPS. Our 'Made in India' solution is comprehensive, complete and globally competitive. It reaffirms my faith in the abundant talent of Indian engineers to deliver world class products in such a cutting-edge technology.  Recently, we received the necessary regulatory approvals... as well as trial spectrum for initiating 5G field-trials. As I speak to you, the entire 5G Standalone Network has been installed in our data centres across the nation and also at our trial sites in Navi Mumbai.  We are confident of being the first to launch full-fledged 5G services. And because of our converged, future-proof architecture JIO's network is uniquely positioned to quickly and seamlessly upgrade from 4G to 5G.  To develop the end-to-end 5G ecosystem we are now working with leading global partners to develop a full range of 5G-capable devices. The Jio 5G technology is well positioned to create compelling applications for consumers and enterprises spanning Healthcare, Education, Entertainment, Retail and other key verticals of the economy.  One exciting 5G-enabled solution that JIO is developing with Sir H. N. Reliance Foundation Hospital is a state-of-the- art Connected Ambulance. With real-time, high-fidelity Telemedicine and remote doctor access, each Connected Ambulance can become a virtual extension of a hospital emergency room even while on the move.  We are developing with Reliance Foundation schools to use 5G to deliver immersive and interactive AR/ VR content to students and classrooms making the learning process a delightful, memorable and enriching experience.  We hope that such showcases will catalyse the emergence of a vibrant, local 5G ecosystem making India a global hub for 5G development and export. So JIO is not just working to make India 2G-MUKT&hellip; but also 5G-YUKT.  And, once JIO's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, we are excited by the prospect of exporting JIO 5G solutions to other telecom operators across the world.  Friends,  JIO has developed deep expertise in multiple emerging technologies like 5G, AI/ML and blockchain and Mixed Reality. We are developing 100% owned Intellectual Property&hellip;  We have access to deep domain knowledge and operational experience within the Reliance Group across key Industry verticals.  We have a passionate and talented team&hellip; and world-class partners and we have the opportunity to serve a global audience.  In all, JIO PLATFORMS is blossoming into a global technology player&hellip; capable of creating multifold societal, customer and shareholder value for years to come.  5. Reliance Retail  Dear Shareholders,  Now let me talk about Reliance Retail.  This past year was the true test for our business. Despite challenging and restrictive operating conditions, Reliance Retail continued to deliver industry leading returns.  We added 1,500 new stores, which is amongst the largest retail expansion undertaken by any retailer during this period, taking our store count to 12,711.  We continue to maintain and strengthen our leadership position. Today one in every eight Indians shops with Reliance Retail.  My Dear Shareholders,  Let me present some of the highlights for this year:  Our apparel business sold nearly five lakh units per day and over 18 crore units during the year. This is equivalent to dressing the entire population of UK, Germany and Spain once.  Ajio has emerged as one of the leading digital commerce platforms for fashion and lifestyle with a portfolio of over 2,000 labels and brands and listing of over 5 lakh options. Driven by innovation, Ajio now contributes to over 25% of our apparel business.  We further consolidated our position in consumer electronics and sold 4.5 crore units of electronics last year which translates to over 120,000 units per day.  Our Omni commerce capabilities allow us to deliver an unparalleled service proposition across 1,300 cities.  As India's largest grocery retailer, Reliance Retail sold over a billion units of groceries or about 30 lakh units per day. Our grocery staff operated on the frontlines of crisis ensuring availability of essential products to our customers and kirana partners.  JioMart registered over 6.5 lakh peak orders in a single day. JioMart's growth is a testament to its already loyal customer base, 80% of whom are repeat shoppers. JioMart New commerce's aim is to transform and grow the small merchant ecosystem, so our merchant partners prosper.  Over the past year, over 3 lakh merchant or shop keeper partners across 150 cities were enabled and empowered to transform their businesses both physically and digitally.  Our promise to them is simple:  'Customer Apka, Support Hamara' &mdash; We support you, so that you can serve your customers better&rsquo;  A testament to our promise is that we have seen a 3x growth in kirana orders and 2x growth in order frequency. Expansion across cities is well underway and we will onboard over One Crore merchant partners over the next three years.  This will trigger a socio-economic transformation on an extraordinary scale in India, especially when coupled with our mission of employment generation.  Even in these challenging times, I am personally proud to report to you that Reliance Retail has not only protected jobs, but also created over 65,000 new jobs. Reliance Retail currently employs over 2 lakh people making us one of the largest employers in the country. Over the next three years, we shall further create employment for over ten lakh people and enable the livelihoods for many more.  Growth in the retail sector will usher growth across the value chain &mdash; from raw material producers to large and small manufacturers, from logistics service providers to merchants, to Consumers. In order to expand this circle of shared prosperity, we will be focussing on the following five key initiatives:  First, we will further invest in our research, design and product development capabilities. In the next year we will set up design, research, technology and innovation centres in key areas globally and nationally to develop differentiated offerings for our diverse customer groups.  Second, we will further strengthen our sourcing ecosystem working closely with producers, MSMEs, service providers, local and international brand companies. We will make them our partners in the journey of value creation that our New Commerce model seeks to unlock.  Third, we are investing in building state-of-the-art supply chain infrastructure across India by linking all major sourcing and consumption locations. This will maximise efficiencies and minimise losses in the supply chain, so that we can share the gains with both consumers and producers.  An automated, modular, reliable and scalable warehousing and logistics ecosystem will enable us to deliver products anywhere across the country in the shortest possible time.  Fourth, we will focus on expanding our store footprint multi-fold this year with co-located delivery hubs over the next few years. They will provide a strong network to reach and serve millions of merchants and customers.  And fifth, we will continue acquiring businesses to heighten our offering and experience to customers, sharpen our omni-channel capabilities, drive operating efficiencies and strengthen our talent pool. Recent acquisitions include leading physical/digital commerce platforms like Netmeds, Urban Ladder and Zivame.  Reliance Retail continues to be amongst the fastest growing retailers in the world. We are committed to grow our business so that we are among the top 10 retailers globally. I am confident that Reliance Retail is on a hyper growth trajectory to grow at least 3x in the next 3-5 years.  6. Media Business  Dear Shareowners,  Network18 successfully overcame the logistical and business challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the pandemic, our journalists continue to venture out into the field every day so that viewers and readers get relevant information from inside the safety of their homes.  Our entertainment flagship brand, Colors, was the first to resume fresh programming after the first wave of lockdowns, being true to its mission of keeping India entertained with wholesome and creative fare.  7. Value Creation  I now will like to present our Value Creation roadmap.  Your company has a proven track record of creating maximum societal value and maximum shareholder value through our business operations as well as philanthropic initiatives. The year has proved, beyond doubt, the resilience of our businesses and our ability to continuously innovate to create value even in adverse conditions.  You are well aware of Reliance's epic journey &mdash; from being a small textile company that had its IPO less than 50 years ago to joining the ranks of 50 most valuable companies in the world.  Reliance is probably the only large company in the world that has successfully transformed itself from being a traditional industrial business into an enterprise that now includes two mega-scale consumer and technology businesses.  Both Jio and Retail are at the beginning of their journey. Yet, both have an embedded culture of continuous value creation. Both have also brought immense benefits to hundreds of millions of consumers by mastering the power of revolutionary new technologies.  Our O2C business combined with our new energy and materials plan will usher in a new era of exponential growth.  In the last 10 years, Reliance invested over USD 90 billion in creating substantial wealth for the nation and value for the shareholders. In the coming decade, Reliance has the capacity to catalyse investments of over USD 200 billion directly and through partners.  These investments will create value on an exponential scale. They will based on our disciplined capital allocation approach, preference for pursuing asset light strategies and emphasis on superior investment grade ratings.  These investments will also create over 10 lakh new employment opportunities, besides fostering thousands of small and medium enterprises across the country.  I assure you that your Company will consistently increase payout to its shareholders as our earnings continue to grow. I am confident that Reliance's multiple investment and business announcements today will help in kick-starting growth in the Indian economy.  I believe speedy recovery in the post-COVID period is beyond any doubt. But beyond recovery, there will be rapid resurgence. I have no doubt that India is destined to emerge as one of the top three economies in the world.  And as your company in its Golden Decade transforms itself as New Reliance, it is destined to play a proud role in the emergence of a New India.  My Most Esteemed Shareholders,  My father Dhirubhai founded Reliance on the principles of investing in future technologies, investing in Indian talent, and investing in India's growth opportunity.  I have continued the tradition of following his evergreen principles while growing Reliance as a world-class enterprise.  As Reliance climbs new summits of success in its onward journey, it will also cross new milestones in being a CARING and EMPATHETIC CORPORATE CITIZEN.  But believe me: The Best of Reliance is yet to come!  I have no doubt whatsoever that the next generation of leaders at Reliance, led by Isha, Akash and Anant, will further enrich this precious legacy.  8. Concluding Remarks  Dear Shareholders,  We are meeting at a time when the second wave of the Covid pandemic is fast receding.  Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Central Government and all the State Governments, along with civil society organisations and corporates, have co-ordinated a massive effort in this fight.  But as a company, as a country, as mankind &mdash; and each one of us as individuals &mdash; we have learnt an important lesson. We must be far better prepared to face such crises in future and never let our guard down.  To achieve this, the most essential resource we need &mdash; which is also the most useful resource &mdash; is a POSITIVE MINDSET.  In trying times like these, POSITIVITY acts like a highly effective medicine. It works wonders for individuals, families and for the society.  Despair weakens us. Determination strengthens us. Negativity numbs us with pessimism and inaction. Positivity provides us with hope and confidence. Our ancient civilisation has survived many crises in its long history.  Because our forefathers had UNLIMITED POSITIVITY and SELF-BELIEF.  My father, Dhirubhai Ambani, used to say, &ldquo;Challenge negative forces with hope, self-confidence and conviction, and the ambition and initiative will ultimately triumph.&rdquo; I have absolutely no doubt that India will conquer the COVID crisis &mdash; sooner rather than later.  Post COVID, India will emerge stronger. It will be a Better India, a Resurgent India, a more Equal India, and a far more Self-Confident India.  I foresee that the Indian economy will bounce back at a rate that will surprise the world. And prosperity and opportunities will be created for all on a scale never seen before. Not for a few, but for all 1.35 billion Indians.  Indeed, I see the global economy resetting itself in ways that will create a more EQUAL WORLD. May God forever guide us along this path.  9. Acknowledgements  I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, lenders, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.  I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their oversight in this crucial phase of our growth, their support and immense encouragement.  I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly to create and sustain a world-class enterprise.  Thank you!  &amp;amp;nbsp;  June 24, 2021  Text of the speech ends here.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, the Vice President of&nbsp;IIFL Institutional Equities talks about the expectations from RIL's upcoming AGM, moats for the company, growing contribution of&nbsp;Jio and Retail and much more.&nbsp;Edited Excerpts:  Q: Reliance Industries' Annual General Meeting is scheduled to be held on June 24. What are your&nbsp;expectations from the event?  In the past 12 months, RIL has not only mobilised funds aggregating Rs 2,16,400 crore to de-leverage its balance sheet but also inducted strategic investors in its high growth businesses such as organised retail (Reliance Retail) and technology (Jio). In this context, RIL is expected to share the value added by each of these stakeholders to the individual businesses, how the individual businesses are shaping up, and what should be the growth/investment outlook.  Some comments are expected towards value unlocking in its O2C business, where outlook on margins is improving, given the pick up in global consumption. Media articles also suggest that RIL may induct Aramco's CEO on its board which would be seen as a step towards a much larger partnership between the two conglomerates.  Also read -&nbsp;RIL AGM on June 24 | Goldman Sachs expects the retail business to be the next growth engine  Investors are also expecting some comments on 1) progress and possible launch dates for the smartphone being developed by Jio and Google jointly; 2) roadmap for the listing of Reliance Retail and 3) progress to induct a strategic investor in O2C business.  RIL Chairman in the last AGM outlined ambitions to become a net carbon zero company by 2035. Investors would keenly await the strategy adopted by RIL to achieve this target, as it would significantly improve its positioning on the ESG (Environmental Social &amp;amp;amp; Governance) framework.  Q: What is the reason behind your bullish view on Reliance Industries; any price targets?&nbsp;  RIL's consolidated earnings are set to register a 17 percent per annum growth through FY21-23ii &ndash; on the back of - 1) recovery in the O2C business: cyclical recovery in gross refining margin (GRMs) aided by pick up in consumption across the globe clubbed with strength in petchem deltas; 2) 34 percent growth in Jio's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) (10 percent per annum growth in ARPU assumed); 3) 26 percent per annum growth in EBITDA of Reliance Retail, as we build in 14 percent per annum growth in the area under operations and improving revenue and profit margins. The earnings growth has an upside, provided the GRM (gross refining margin) improvement is ahead of estimate and recovery in retail sales growth is sharper. For a $1 per barrel change in GRMs, the earnings swing by 6 percent, while a 10 percent change in sales growth for Retail causes a consolidated PAT change of 2 percent.  In the base case, we value RIL at Rs 2,200 per share, near the CMP (current market price), but the stock can offer significant upsides with the following events: 1) value unlocking in the O2C segment (induction of strategic investor); 2) successful consummation of Future Retail's business which as of now is under litigation.  Also read -&nbsp;RIL AGM | Awaiting news on demerger of RIL into 3 different businesses &mdash; Jio, Retail &amp;amp;amp; Petrochemical: Vinod Nair of Geojit        Q: What is your outlook on the telecom business? How much do you see it contributing by 2025?  The business outlook on Jio's operations is improving. The recently launched Jio Phone with attractive plans, the upcoming launch of the Google phone, and the capacity boost from a 45 percent increase in spectrum holdings post-March auctions are likely to result in higher subscriber adds in the next few months (notwithstanding some weakness in April and May due to the second wave of Covid).  With Vodafone Idea facing large cash outflows from December 2021, we see either industry-wide price hikes or accelerated market share loss for Vodafone Idea. Jio stands to benefit in either case. The progress on the FTTH (Fiber to the home) business remains steady. The key trigger to watch out for in the near term would be the pricing of the smartphone to be launched in collaboration with Google and the plans. IIFL expects Jio to contribute 13 percent to RIL&rsquo;s consolidated revenues by FY23.  Q: Do you think Reliance Industries will raise more funds for its retail and Jio businesses in the coming years?  RIL, through FY21, raised Rs 1.52 lakh crore and Rs 37,700 crore through induction of strategic investors in Jio and retail, respectively. The management commentary on capex intensity in each of these businesses is lowering at a time when the visibility on cash flows is set to improve. As such, the balance sheet of RIL and individual businesses is strong enough to pursue organic growth initiatives and bolster their competitive positioning in their respective addressable markets. We, however, expect RIL to induct a strategic investor in the O2C business sometime in the next 12-18 months and unlock value.  Q: Do you think Reliance will complete its stake sale in O2C business by 2022?  RIL has one of the most complex and integrated O2C business operations. Its deep integration helps to offset the impact of volatility in the feedstock prices and the product cracks on its O2C profits. While it is pursuing partnerships with global firms which can add value to its operations and enhance shareholders value, it would be inappropriate to comment on the timelines. This is because of two key reasons: first, the strategic partnerships are usually not forged by keeping specific timelines in mind, and secondly, it is a function of growth strategy outlined, ability to add value in the relationship, and valuation benchmarks. RIL Chairman, in the last AGM, said that active negotiations with Aramco were underway.  Q: What is your view on Reliance Retail and will it contribute more than the telecom segment, to total revenue in coming years?  RIL's retail business has ramped up faster than our estimates, particularly the store additions, in a challenging macro environment. While the near term outlook is tricky, given the 2nd wave of COVID and resultant impact on footfalls, we like RIL's approach of focusing on omni-channel offerings, and strengthening the supply chain, while ramping up the JioMart / digital sales channel. Our FY22ii EBITDA assumes normal operations for 3 quarters; FY23ii EBITDA growth of 25 percent YoY has upside, given the pace of current ramp up in operations. Our forecasts assume 23 percent-32 percent sales growth in FY22/23ii and EBITDA margins of 6.1/6.3 percent versus 5.5 percent seen in FY21ii.  RIL's proposed takeover of the retailing and logistics business assets of the Future group is facing legal issues, and awaits SC judgment. Future Retail's asset takeover will help RIL fast track its ambitions to grow the footprint in the organized retail segment. As such, the 26 percent per annum EBITDA growth forecast in the retail business is without integrating the assets of Future Retail. Takeover, if completed in the next 6-8 months, can add Rs 1,00,000-1,20,000 crore enterprise value to RIL's retailing business.  By FY23, we forecast Reliance Retail to register Rs 2,27,000 crore sales, and contribute 26 percent to the consolidated sales. These revenues would be almost 106 percent higher than estimated revenues of the telecom segment.

The key focus in the past several AGMs was largely on telecom and retail businesses which&nbsp;collectively&nbsp;provided revenue of Rs 2.44 lakh crore in FY21; experts believe this time&nbsp;will be no different.  In FY21, as per its targets, Reliance had the largest fundraise in Jio Platforms as well as Reliance Retail. Reliance Retail raised Rs 47,265 crore for a 10.09 percent stake from marquee global investors, while its telecom and digital services company Jio Platforms garnered Rs 1.52 lakh crore from several global investors including Google, Facebook and Intel.  In the last AGM, before stake sale in Reliance Retail,&nbsp;the company&nbsp;had raised a total of Rs 2,12,809 crore&nbsp;from Rights Issue, investments in Jio Platforms, and investment by BP, which largely helped the conglomerate become&nbsp;net-debt free, much ahead of its target of March 2021.  The company has been in the process to spin off its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business into a separate subsidiary. &amp;quot;The scheme for transfer of O2C undertaking to a wholly-owned subsidiary has been filed with the National Company Law Tribunal and is pending approval. The said scheme has been approved by the creditors and shareholders of the company,&amp;quot; said Reliance Industries in its FY21 earnings press release.

Also, announcements regarding&nbsp;the RIL-Aramco deal, the launch of 5G and new tech products &amp;amp;amp; services&nbsp;are expected in the AGM, Nair said.  RIL,&nbsp;in its recent earnings press release, said Jio was conducting field trials for fine-tuning network performance and configurations for its 5G network, and work was also ongoing on standardising 5G device configurations by collaborating with&nbsp;original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  Reliance further said it has scaled up JioMart to become a truly horizontal platform with a presence across Grocery, Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Lifestyle, Digital and Pharma. In addition, JioMart has all the technological functionalities that should enable it to become&nbsp;a diverse third-party platform, it added.  Reliance Industries shares gained 22.2 percent since its last AGM held on July 15, 2020. Yea-to-date, the stock&nbsp;is 13.6 percent.

RIL, which has a track record of meeting its target ahead of deadlines, is expected to make announcements&nbsp;across its&nbsp;telecom, retail and O2C business.  &amp;quot;In the upcoming AGM, Reliance is likely to announce kickstarting 5G services which might begin in late 2021. Moreover, 5G phones are likely to be revealed in the AGM which might be another interesting development to watch out for,&amp;quot; Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research told Moneycontrol.  In the last AGM, Chairman Mukesh Ambani said Jio designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch, enabling the company to launch a world-class 5G service in India, using 100 percent homegrown technologies and solutions.  &amp;quot;This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available&hellip; and can be ready for field deployment next year. And because of JIO's converged, all-IPnetwork architecture&hellip; we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G,&amp;quot;&nbsp;Ambani said.  &amp;quot;Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio Platforms would be well-positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally, as a complete managed service,&amp;quot; he added.  &amp;quot;We believe we can design entry-level 4 or even 5G smartphone&nbsp;for a fraction of its current cost. Through the partnership with Google, we are confident that we can accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian.&amp;quot;  According to Gaurav Garg, JioBook, the low-cost laptops, is another attraction that might lure investors.  Garg said announcement over dividend declaration and bonus&nbsp;can also be expected&nbsp;in this AGM.  &amp;quot;Reliance likes to keep the market price of shares around Rs 1,000 so we might get to see 1:1 bonus announcement,&amp;quot; he said.  Earlier this month, Reliance Industries fixed June 14, 2021, as the record date for the purpose of determining the members eligible to receive the dividend for the financial year 2020-21.  The dividend, if declared at the AGM, will be paid within a week from the conclusion of the AGM, the company said.  Further, Gaurav Garg feels specific announcements are expected on the progress of Saudi Aramco deal in O2C business as well as Future Retail merger in the retail space.  The stock of RIL has rallied 12.1 percent&nbsp;so far in 2021. In the last 12 months, it has&nbsp;climbed 34.4 percent.

In a recent communication to the Union Health Ministry, Reliance Foundation has said the imported Johnson and Johnson vaccine will be administered within the organization only and not at all be used for commercial purpose, sources said.  The Foundation may source additional quantities too, the company is learnt to have communicated.  It may also explore the possibilities of importing jabs from other vaccine producers in the future and the same will be used for internal purposes only, the organisation has said.  Led by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani's wife Nita Ambani, Reliance Foundation was set up in 2010 to provide impetus to various philanthropic initiatives of RIL.  The Foundation has told the government that during the unprecedented pandemic, it has strived to stand shoulder-to-shoulder to provide all possible relief support to the society at large by setting up COVID-19 hospitals and care centres and providing free meals.  &amp;quot;Reliance Foundation will import and receive the shipment of Johnson and Johnson's Janssen Covid-19 vaccine from the USA with the purpose of captive consumption and to administer our entire workforce pan India. Import of this vaccine shall be administered within the organization only and not at all for commercial purpose,&amp;quot; a source quoted Reliance&nbsp;Foundation as having communicated to the ministry.  Pointing out that several hospitals are owned by it in India, the Foundation said this has made it acquainted with the vaccine in terms of shortage of requirements, transportation and distribution.  Johnson and Johnson had in April said it has sought an approval from the India's drug regulator to conduct a bridging clinical trial of its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine in the country.  The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) had in February approved Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine that works with just one dose for emergency use.  In a series of high-level meetings chaired by the Cabinet Secretary last month on the availability of vaccines in the global as well as domestic markets, it was conveyed that there are limited prospects of Johnson and Johnson exporting its vaccine from the US to other countries in the near future and the &amp;quot;entire production&amp;quot; at Biological E facilities in India, beginning July/August, will be handed over to the pharma giant under a contract between the companies.  The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), along with the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), has been asked to work on securing a part of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, to be manufactured by Biological E, for the Indian market, the sources said.

The upmove comes after the stock underperformed for almost&nbsp;five&nbsp;months versus broader markets. After reaching a high of Rs 2,369 a share in September 2020, the stock saw a correction of almost 22 percent and consolidated at around Rs 1,900,&nbsp;against this backdrop, the stock's upmove is notable.  What are the triggers for RIL going ahead?  The rally on May 28 can be attributed to several factors, including some non-fundamental elements, hence, we believe it is best not to analyse all these aspects in depth. Rather, we see three key drivers for the stock: 1) improving outlook on each business segment; 2) value unlocking in the O2C business and 3) inorganic growth initiatives.  1 Improving business outlook  The outlook for each of RIL's business segments is improving, and we forecast RIL's consolidated earnings to register&nbsp;CAGR (compound annual growth rate)&nbsp;of 19 percent through FY21-23ii. The growth is likely to be broad-based, rather than concentrated in any specific segment. During this period, we forecast the share of RIL's B2C businesses in overall EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at 53-58 percent versus 50 percent in FY21. Consider this:  a) O2C: Integration benefits will play now  RIL's O2C (oil-to-chemical) business is uniquely placed, given its refinery-petrochem integration. While we think petchem margins should soften relative to the current trends, gross refining margins (GRMs) should revive over the next 12 months, with pick up in global oil consumption. And, to that extent, we see low risk to our Rs 44,700 crore/Rs 47,500 crore EBITDA in the O2C segment through FY22ii/23ii, respectively.  If the global recovery is stronger in FY23, there is an upside risk to our estimates. However, it is too early to factor this in. The exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P)&nbsp; business, though relatively smaller compared to O2C, has also surprised positively. We factor-in KG D6 sales volumes of 15/18mmscmd through FY22/23ii, respectively, and assume no material changes in its realisations&mdash;around $4 per million British thermal unit (mmbtu).  b) Jio: Heads I win, tails you lose  The recently launched attractive Jio phone plans, the upcoming launch of Google phone and the capacity boost from the 45 percent increase in spectrum holdings after March auctions are likely to result in higher subscriber additions in the next few months (notwithstanding some weakness in April and May due to the second wave of COVID). We do not see significant price hikes in the next six months.  With Vi (Vodafone Idea) facing large cash outflows from December 2021, we forecast either industry-wide price hikes or an accelerated market-share loss for Vi, Jio stands to benefit in any case. Progress on the FTTH (fibre to the home) business remains steady. The key near-term trigger to watch out for would be the pricing of the smartphone to be launched in collaboration with Google and the plans.  Also read: Reliance Industries annual report key highlights: From strong liquidity to growth plans for Jio  c) Retail: Solid ramp up in operations  RIL's retail business, particularly store additions, has ramped up faster than our estimates in a challenging macro environment. While the near-term outlook is moot, given the second COVID wave and the resultant impact on footfalls, we like RIL&rsquo;s approach of focussing on omni-channel offerings and strengthening its supply chain, while ramping up the JioMart/digital sales channel.  Our FY22ii EBITDA assumes normal operations for three quarters; FY23ii EBITDA growth of 25 percent YoY has an upside, given the pace of the current ramp-up in operations. We, nonetheless, will wait for the current macro environment to phase out. Our forecasts assume 23&nbsp;percent and 32 percent sales growth estimates in FY22 ad FY23 and EBITDA margins of 6.1&nbsp;and 6.3 percent versus 5.5 percent seen in FY21ii.    RIL's reported net cash, as of FY21, stood at Rs 2,200 crore and adjusted for the deferred spectrum liabilities and creditors for Capex, net financial liabilities were seen at Rs 83,400 crore. We think that by FY22, RIL shall be able to prune the net debt by 69 percent to Rs 25,900 crore, given the completion of the rights issue and operational cash flows. As such, the capex intensity is incrementally lowering. Effectively by FY23, RIL should be a net-cash company, which bodes well for shareholders.  Also read: Reliance Industries sees big opportunity in global consensus against climate change  2 Value unlocking in O2C business  RIL is set to transfer its O2C business to a 100 percent subsidiary in FY22. The company is also well poised to induct a strategic investor in this business, which will fast-track its growth plans in the segment and meet the net carbon zero target by 2035.  In the base case, we value the business at an enterprise value (EV) of $63&nbsp;billion, and strategic stake sale to a global player such as Aramco at a higher valuation (eg $75&nbsp;billion) will help unlock the value.  3 Inorganic growth initiatives  RIL's proposed takeover of the retailing and logistics business assets of the Future Group is facing legal issues and awaits the Supreme Court judgment. FRL's (Future Retail) asset takeover will help RIL fast-track ambitions to grow its footprint in the organised retail segment.  As such, the 26 percent per annum EBITDA&nbsp;growth forecast in the retail business is without integrating the assets of FRL. Take over, if completed in the next six-eight months, can add Rs 1,00,000-1,20,000 crore EV to RIL&rsquo;s retailing business.  Also read: Jio accelerating rollout of digital platforms, indigenously-developed 5G stack: RIL annual report  What should investors do with RIL stock?  We maintain our positive bias on the stock. We value RIL's O2C business at $63&nbsp;billion; note that such valuation is lower by 16 percent versus the speculated $75-billion valuation attributed to the possible stake sale to ARAMCO.  IIFL's telecom&nbsp;team values Jio's EV at $82.9&nbsp;billion, which is based on discounted cash flow (DCF) and assumes revenue market share (RMS) of 51 percent in a steady state, post FY24.  We now value Reliance Retail at EV of $67&nbsp;billion, based on 35x FY23ii EBITDA. We are impressed by the pace of sales&nbsp;per EBITDA&nbsp;ramp-up at Reliance Retail and the faster-than-expected normalisation of operations would compel us to move the retail valuation even higher.  Reliance Retail successfully consummating the FRL acquisition could lead to significant value creation for the overall retail business. Our base case does not ascribe any option value for such a takeover. Against this backdrop, we value RIL at SoTP of Rs 2,200&nbsp;per share.  If RIL is able to induct a strategic investor at $75&nbsp;billion valuation, the SoTP (Sum of the parts) would move up by Rs 133&nbsp;per share; the FRL acquisition can lead to an uptick in SoTP by Rs 172&nbsp;per share over the next 12-18 months. And if the much-awaited increases in telecom ARPU come through (say tariff hikes of Rs 50 in the next 12-18 months), RIL's SoTP swings up by around Rs 200&nbsp;per share.    We reiterate our &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; rating on RIL and believe the stock will remain sensitive to news flow on the deal with ARAMCO and the Supreme Court verdict on Future Retail.

RIL said it has ramped up production of medical grade oxygen from zero to 1,000 metric tonne per day and is ensuring swift supply of the resource across states and Union Territories.  &ldquo;Traditionally, Reliance is not a manufacturer of medical grade liquid oxygen. Yet, starting from nil before the pandemic, Reliance Industries has now become India&rsquo;s largest producer of this life-saving resource from a single location,&rdquo; RIL said in a media statement.  &ldquo;At its refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Jamnagar and other facilities, RIL now produces over 1,000 MT of medical grade liquid oxygen per day &mdash; or over 11 percent of India&rsquo;s total production &ndash; meeting the needs of nearly every one in ten patients,&rdquo; the company added.  This oxygen is being provided free of cost to several states across India &ldquo;to bring immediate relief to over 1 lakh patients&rdquo; each day, RIL said.  The conglomerate added that it had reconfigured and optimised its operations designed for refining and petrochemicals grade oxygen to produce high-purity medical grade oxygen despite not being a manufacturer of medical grade liquid oxygen before the pandemic.    Commenting on these initiatives, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited, said: &ldquo;For me and for all of us at Reliance, nothing is more important than saving every life as India battles against a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an immediate need to maximise India&rsquo;s production and transportation capacities for medical grade oxygen. I am proud of our engineers at Jamnagar who have worked tirelessly, with a great sense of patriotic urgency, to meet this new challenge.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I am truly humbled by the determination and sense of purpose shown by the bright, young members of the Reliance family who have once again risen to the occasion and delivered when India needs it the most,&rdquo; Ambani added.  &amp;quot;Our country is going through an unprecedented crisis. We at Reliance Foundation will continue to do everything we can to help. Every life is precious. Our plants at our Jamnagar refinery have been repurposed overnight to produce medical grade liquid oxygen that is being distributed across India. Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow countrymen and women. Together, we will overcome these difficult times,&rdquo; Nita Ambani, Founder-Chairperson of the Reliance Foundation, said.    Reliance said it had supplied over 55,000 MT of medical grade liquid oxygen across the country since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.  To overcome the transportation bottlenecks in supply, &ldquo;Reliance engineers made smart logistical modifications to rail and road transport, such as laying parallel lines, using hoses and loading up liquid tankers through pressure differential, since liquid oxygen pumps cannot be installed at short notice,&rdquo; the company said.  Nitrogen tankers were converted to transport trucks for medical grade oxygen through processes approved by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO), the relevant regulatory body of the Government of India, RIL added.  RIL also said it had organised airlifting of 24 ISO containers into India from Saudi Arabia, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Thailand adding 500 MT of new transportation capacity for liquid oxygen. &ldquo;These containers will help in removing the transport constraints for medical grade liquid oxygen in the country.&rdquo;  The company thanked Aramco, BP and the Indian Air Force (IAF) for their help in providing and transporting ISO containers, adding that more ISO containers will be airfreighted over the next few days.

The brokerage has forecast 1 percent QoQ growth in Q4 consolidated profit and 19 percent QoQ rise in consolidated revenue.

As hospitals in New Delhi run short on oxygen, funeral pyres burn across the capital and residents wonder which city will get overwhelmed next, local markets are ticking along in the expectation of attractive returns. Fund managers have turned net sellers of local equities after six months of inflows. The benchmark Nifty 50 just had its best day in almost a month, however, and the MSCI India Index is up over the period too. The India basket trades at an exuberant multiple of nearly 21 times projected earnings for the year, a premium to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. After depreciating earlier in the month, the rupee is rebounding too. Multiple factors underpin the optimism despite more than 360,000 new cases in 24 hours on Wednesday. India&rsquo;s economy is slowing but less harshly than during last year&rsquo;s lockdown. There&rsquo;s confidence in a faster vaccine rollout, as well. Half the country could be inoculated by year-end. About 9&nbsp;percent of the population has had one dose, per Reuters, a higher rate than in Japan and Australia. The rate is double in big cities like Mumbai. The acceleration of digital adoption is also supporting longer-term perspectives. The crisis has forced people and businesses online, putting India in position to develop technologically faster than otherwise. A strong capital cushion provides extra comfort. Foreign-exchange reserves of almost $600 billion are roughly double the level in 2013, when the US Federal Reserve curtailed its quantitative easing programme and triggered rupee volatility. Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s policy agenda from incentives for manufacturers to privatisation is also a draw.   The assumption is that emerging market returns will outpace those of developed ones where interest rates are low or negative. Another is that the rich sliver of the population, whose consumption matters most, won&rsquo;t be impacted much, allowing index heavyweights from Reliance Industries&nbsp;to HDFC Bank&nbsp;to thrive even as smaller rivals struggle. But economists are starting to slash their growth forecasts for India, rising inflation may yet prove a spoilsport, and eventually the weakened spending power of the masses who receive little official support will bite.

It will retain 100 percent management control in the subsidiary which will take charge of all of RIL&rsquo;s refining, marketing and petrochemicals assets that include the world&rsquo;s largest refining complex at Jamnagar and global-scale petrochemical units, it said.  The promoter group will continue to hold a 49.14 percent stake in the O2C business after the reorganisation, which will result in no change in shareholding of the company, RIL said in a note to stock exchanges.  The existing O2C operating team will move to the newly created subsidiary with the transfer of business, but there will be no dilution of earnings or any restriction on the cash flows, RIL said.

The company said that talks with Aramco were still on. The world's largest crude oil exporter Saudi Aramco is in the process of picking up a 20 percent stake in RIL's O2C business.  RIL has also extended an interest-bearing loan of $25 billion to the O2C business. The O2C business will pay floating rate interest linked to one-year SBI MCLR rate. The loan to the O2C business will be paid as and when the strategic investors come in.  RIL said it has already received the nod from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and stock exchanges for the reorganisation. However, it is yet to get a clearance from equity shareholders and creditors, the income tax authority and National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) benches in Mumbai and Ahmedabad.

The proposed O2C subsidiary will include the fuel retail subsidiary in which RIL has a 51 percent stake and the remaining 49 percent belonging to BP plc.  The company&rsquo;s presentation suggested that RIL and its O2C subsidiary will work together to move towards the net carbon-zero targets by 2035. To achieve this, the O2C business will invest in the next generation carbon capture and storage technologies to convert carbon dioxide into useful products and chemicals. It will also accelerate the transition from traditional carbon-based fuels to a hydrogen economy, RIL said.  The company said this development would have no impact on its consolidated financial position, cost of capital, borrowings, investment-grade international, and domestic AAA credit ratings.

Reliance and its partner UK's BP Plc on Friday auctioned 7.5 million standard cubic metres per day of incremental gas from the R-series gas field in the KG-D6 block, benchmarking it to a gas marker for the very first time in the country.  The auction was held under the liberalised price discovery rules notified by the government that allowed affiliates of the gas producer to bid and buy natural gas.  Reliance O2C, an affiliate of Reliance, picked up 4.8 mmscmd of gas in Friday''s auction that lasted for seven-and-a-half-hours, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.  State gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd won 0.85 mmscmd of supplies while Shell picked up 0.7 mmscmd. Adani Total Gas Ltd got 0.1 mmscmd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) 0.2 mmscmd and Torrest Gas 0.02 mmscmd.  Other buyers include IRM Energy (0.1 mmscmd), PIL (0.35 mmscmd) and IGS (0.35 mmscmd), they said.  Sources said the gas was bought at a price of USD 0.18 per million British thermal unit discount to JKM i.e. price of JKM (minus) USD 0.18 with tenures ranging from 3 to 5 years.  Reliance did not respond to email sent for comments.  Reliance O2C is the new unit that holds the firm''s refinery and petrochemical assets.  E-bidding process was conducted through an online web-based electronic bidding platform by CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited (CRIS), an independent agency empanelled by Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). CRIS partnered with e-Procurement Technologies Limited (EPTL) and developed e-bidding platform.  The bidding process was carried out as per the guidelines notified by the government in October 2020.  Sources said the bidding process for sale of gas was launched on December 30, 2020 and it witnessed participation from around 15 bidders from city gas distribution sector, steel, power, refineries, petrochemicals, resellers and other industries.  The e-bidding process required bidders to submit their price bids linked to international LNG price benchmark JKM (Japan Korea Marker). The JKM represents price for spot LNG delivered in Asian market and is now being widely used in LNG industry as a marker for in medium/ long term LNG contracts instead of traditional linkage to oil.  This was second time Reliance-BP conducted an e-bidding process which ran on a dynamic forward auction basis for sale of KG-D6 gas. Earlier in November 2019, 5 mmscmd of natural gas was sold at price in range of around 8.6 per cent of Brent crude oil for tenure ranging from 2 to 6 years.  Reliance-BP started production of gas on December 18 last year from the R Cluster ultra-deep-water gas field in block KG D6 off the east coast of India.  The duo developing three deep-water gas projects in block KG-D6 -- R Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ -- which together are expected to meet around 15 per cent of India''s gas demand by 2023.  R Cluster is the first of the three projects to come onstream and is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia.  E-bidding auction rules asked bidders to &amp;quot;quote the variable denoted as ''V'' in USD per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) terms.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;The gas price (in USD/MMBtu (GCV)) shall be = JKM + V,&amp;quot; the bidding notice said.  GCV stands for gross calorific value.  ''V'' can be a positive, zero or negative number and up to two decimal places but it cannot be less than (-)0.30 USD/MMBtu, it said.  This means users will have to quote -0.30 or higher value of ''V''.  If JKM averaged USD 6 per MMBtu, the price will be USD 5.82 per MMBtu.  But Reliance-BP will only get the government notified cap price for gas from deep-sea fields.  Pricing of gas at JKM will be the first time that domestically produced gas is being sold at rates linked to an international gas benchmark, industry sources said.  Also, this will be the first discovery of gas price since the October 2020 decision of the government setting out uniform e-bidding norms for finding the market price.  That Cabinet decision also allowed the sale of gas to ''affiliates'' and so while Reliance-BP affiliate companies couldn''t participate in the November 2019 price discovery, they did in e-bidding on February 5.  The government has given operators the freedom to discover market prices but this rate is subject to a pricing ceiling or cap that the government notifies every six months. The cap for six months to March 31, 2021, is USD 4.06 per mmBtu.  And accordingly, Reliance-BP would get only that amount for the gas.  Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL in November 2019 bought the majority of the initial 5 mmscmd of gas planned to be produced from R-Series in the KG-D6 block by bidding between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent of dated Brent price.  In that bidding, Reliance-BP had asked gas users to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.  A floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price was set, which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for securing gas supplies.  Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.  Reliance got USD 4.205 per MMBtu for gas from D1 and D3 and MA fields during April 2019 and March 2014. It would have got double of that rate if a new formula proposed by the Rangarajan committee was approved but the new BJP government scrapped it and brought a new formula on pricing gas at rates prevalent in export surplus nations such as the US and Russia.  The rates came to USD 5.05 in 2014 and are currently at USD 1.79 per mmBtu.  Reliance-BP is investing USD 5 billion in bringing to production three deepwater gas projects in block KG-D6 R-Cluster, Satellites Cluster, and MJ which together are expected to meet about 15 per cent of India''s gas demand by 2023.  R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12.9 mmscmd while satellites, which are supposed to begin output from the third quarter of the 2021 calendar year, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in the third quarter of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.  Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.  While the MA field stopped producing last year, output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.  Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

Reliance, which operates the world's largest single location oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat with capacity of 68.2 million tonnes a year, got 2 million barrels of consignment Permian basin, the US supplier said in a statement.  Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV), a division of US oil major Occidental, delivered carbon-neutral oil to Reliance, the firm said. &amp;quot;This transaction, which was arranged in conjunction with Macquarie Group's Commodities and Global Markets group (Macquarie), is the energy industry's first major petroleum shipment for which greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the entire crude lifecycle, well head through combustion of end products, have been offset,&amp;quot; it said.  Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Macquarie will offset carbon dioxide equivalent to that associated with the production, delivery and refining of the crude oil and the use of the resulting product through the retirement of carbon offset credits. This will make the oil 'carbon-neutral'. The Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Sea Pearl containing the carbon-neutral oil unloaded the cargo at Jamnagar on January 28.  &amp;quot;This transaction is a first step in the creation of a new market for climate-differentiated crude oil,&amp;quot; the statement said. It is also a bridge to the development of a further differentiated petroleum product, net-zero oil, which Occidental intends to eventually produce through the capture and sequestration of atmospheric CO2 via industrial-scale direct air capture (DAC) facilities and geological sequestration.  Also read: RIL arm to sell entire stake in some upstream assets in Marcellus shale play  Ambani had in July last year unveiled plans to turn Reliance into a net carbon zero company by 2035. This will be done by embracing new technologies to convert its carbon dioxide emissions into useful products and chemicals. OLCV said the oil was produced in the US Permian Basin by Occidental and delivered to Reliance in India.  &amp;quot;Macquarie arranged and structured the bundled offset supply and retirement,&amp;quot; it said. The offsets were sourced from a variety of projects verified under the Verra Verified Carbon Standard meeting eligibility criteria for the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).  &amp;quot;The volume of offsets applied against the cargo are sufficient to cover the expected GHG emissions from the entire crude lifecycle including oil extraction, transport, storage, shipping, refining, subsequent use, and combustion,&amp;quot; it said. This type of transaction, which involves the bundling of high-quality carbon offsets with crude oil, is an immediate executable solution that helps promote investments in longer-term, industrial-scale decarbonisation strategies.  It is also a step in the furtherance of Occidental's net-zero ambitions and commitment to addressing climate change today. Occidental, the first US-based international energy company to announce an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions associated with the use of its products by 2050, has been using carbon-dioxide in its enhanced oil recovery operations in the Permian for over 40 years.  &amp;quot;We are taking important initial steps to work with our customers in hard-to-decarbonize industries to offer carbon-neutral and other low-carbon products that will leverage our expertise in carbon management to lower their total carbon impact and address Scope 3 emissions,&amp;quot; said Richard Jackson, president of OLCV.

EPS before exceptional items stood at Rs 20.5 per share, marking an increase of 38.2 percent QoQ.  The company reported a record quarterly EBITDA for digital services at Rs 8,942 crore.  Here are 5 key highlights of RIL's December quarter scorecard:  Oil to chemicals (O2C) segment shines:&nbsp;The segment's revenue increased 10 percent QoQ to Rs 83,838 crore on account of higher volumes, mainly in transportation fuels, PTA and polyester, supported by improved product realisation across polymers, intermediates and polyester.  Higher product sales and shifting of product placement from exports to the domestic market boosted EBITDA by 10.3 percent QoQ to Rs 9,756 crore for the quarter. EBITDA margin remained flat at 11.6 percent.  Strong rebound in oil and gas segment: The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment, which includes exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas, witnessed a 21.4 percent QoQ rise in revenue at Rs 431 crore due to higher commodity price realisation and incremental production from R-Cluster.  EBITDA of this segment, which was in the negative in the September quarter, turned positive and stood at Rs 4 crore in the December quarter. EBITDA margin stood at 0.9 percent.  Retail: COVID-related curbs on store operations eased during the quarter, enabling 96 percent of stores to be opened, although only half of them were fully operational.  The company underscored that stores in smaller towns are recovering faster.  The segment's revenue from operations declined 9.7 percent QoQ to Rs 33,018 crore.  Revenue was impacted by the challenging operating conditions due to COVID-19. Besides, the transfer out of the fuel retailing business to the RIL-BP JV, and the decision to convert Reliance Market stores to fulfillment centres to enable city expansion of New Commerce also impacted the revenue of the segment.  EBITDA for the segment zoomed 53.9 percent QoQ to Rs 3,087 crore while EBITDA margin stood at 9.3 percent against 5.5 percent QoQ.  Reliance Retail added over 50,000 new jobs since the beginning of the pandemic and contributes positively to the social and financial well-being of all employees and their families.  Jio Platforms remains on an upward trajectory: Revenue from operations rose 5.3 percent QoQ to Rs 19,475 crore while EBITDA rose 6.4 percent QoQ to Rs 8,483 crore due to growing revenue and operating leverage.  The segment's EBITDA margin for the quarter stood at 43.6 percent which was at 43.1 percent in the September quarter.  Consolidated net profit of the segment grew 15.5 percent QoQ to Rs 3,489 crore.  Jio witnessed a net addition of 52 lakh customers in the December quarter. The total customer base as of December 31, 2020, stood at 41.08 crore.  The average revenue per user (ARPU) during the quarter came at Rs 151 per subscriber per month as against Rs 145 per subscriber per month in the September quarter.  Total data traffic during the quarter grew 4 percent QoQ to 1,586 crore GB whereas total voice traffic during the quarter grew 4.6 percent QoQ to 97,496 crore minutes.  During the quarter, Google invested, post requisite regulatory approvals, an amount of Rs 33,737 crore into Jio Platforms for 7.73 percent stake which took the total investment to Rs 1,52,056 crore by the investors for a stake of 32.88 percent in Jio.  Media segment recovers fully: The revenue of the segment rose 34 percent QoQ to Rs 1,422 crore, recovering fully from the pandemic impact.  Recovery in advertising was sharp and broad-based, resulting in group revenue reviving to pre-pandemic levels.  The segment's EBITDA grew by a whopping 96 percent QoQ and 21 percent YoY to Rs 324 crore while EBITDA margins rose to nearly 23 percent as all three verticals - entertainment, TV and digital news.  Subscription revenue was up 6 percent QoQ and 2 percent YoY. Domestic subscription revenue growth remained strong due to improved tie-ups in TV and digital, offsetting stress in international.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said: &amp;quot;We have delivered strong operational results during the quarter with a robust revival in O2C and retail segments, and steady growth in our digital services business.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate's profit in the previous quarter stood at&nbsp;Rs&nbsp;10,602 crore.  The company said it had recorded the highest ever quarterly consolidated profit before exceptional items at Rs 15,015 crore and EBITDA at Rs 26,094 crore.  Consolidated revenue from operations for the quarter increased 6.7 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs&nbsp;1,23,997 crore, rising sharply from Rs 1,16,195 crore in the September quarter 2020, with strong&nbsp;sequential rebound across all businesses.  The growth in revenue was primarily driven by higher price realisations and higher volumes in O2C segment, higher ARPU and fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) expansion in Digital services business.  &amp;quot;At a time when the Indian economy is poised for a confident recovery, we at Reliance are humbled that we have been able to contribute to it with our company's impressive performance in the third quarter of FY21.

Consolidated EBITDA at Rs 21,566 crore in Q3FY21 increased by 13.8 percent, driven by margin improvement across consumer businesses; with margin expansion of 130 bps at 18.3 percent compared to previous quarter.  On the year-on-year basis, RIL clocked 25.8 percent growth in profit in Q3FY21 at Rs 14,894 crore, and 21.1 percent decline in revenue at Rs 1,23,997 crore compared to corresponding period.  Reliance Jio  Reliance Jio delivered strong performance in the quarter ended December 2020, with consolidated profit rising 15.5 percent sequentially to Rs 3,489 crore and revenue up 5.3 percent QoQ to Rs 19,475 crore.  Average revenue per user (ARPU) in Q3FY21 at Rs 151 per subscriber per month&nbsp;against Rs 145 in the previous quarter.  With net addition at&nbsp;5.2 million customers during the quarter, total customer base stood at 410.8 million as of December 2020, said the company.  On the operating front, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 6.4 percent QoQ to Rs 8,483 crore with margin expanding&nbsp;50 bps QoQ to 43.6 percent due to growing revenue and operating leverage.  &amp;quot;India is today among the leaders driving the Digital Revolution in the world. In order to maintain this lead, Jio will continue to accelerate the rollout of its digital platforms and indigenously developed next generation 5G stack and make it affordable and available everywhere. Jio's 5G service will be a testimony to the vision of AtmaNirbhar Bharat,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  Jio Platforms has achieved a milestone this quarter with annualised operating revenue run-rate of $10 billion with strong revenue and EBITDA growth, said the company in its BSE filing.  Reliance Retail  Reliance Retail delivered a healthy performance with record profit delivery in an operating environment that continued to remain challenging with sporadic COVID related restrictions and local issues, the company said in its BSE filing.  Retail's EBITDA surged 53.9 percent sequentially to a record Rs 3,087 crore with margin expansion of 380 bps QoQ at 9.3 percent for the quarter ended December 2020, whereas revenue from operations declined 9.7 percent QoQ to Rs 33,018 crore for the quarter and value of sales and services for Q3FY21 decreased by 8 percent QoQ to Rs 37,845 crore.  &amp;quot;The underlying operating margin (excluding the impact of the investment income) stood at 7 percent, coming in ahead of last quarter and same time last year. This was led by near doubling of Fashion and Lifestyle earnings, continued benefits from cost management initiatives and a boost from higher investment income of Rs 775 crore,&amp;quot; said Reliance.  With the Indian economy poised for a rapid recovery in 2021 after overcoming the COVID-19&nbsp;constraints, Reliance Retail is confident of maintaining its industry leading and market beating&nbsp;performance.  In November, Reliance Retail Ventures, the subsidiary of RIL, completed fund-raising of Rs 47,265 crore by selling a 10.09 percent stake in the company.  Oil to Chemicals  Reliance's oil to chemicals (O2C) business, which has formally reorganised reporting segments to reflect new strategy and management matrix, clocked 10 percent sequential growth in revenue at Rs 83,838 crore for the quarter ended December 2020 on higher volumes mainly in transportation fuels, PTA and polyester supported by improved product realization across polymers, intermediates and polyester.  At operating level, the segment registered a 10.3 percent QoQ growth in EBITDA at Rs 9,756 crore on higher product sales and shifting of product placement from exports to domestic market, with flat margin at 11.6 percent compared to previous quarter.  Its EBIT grew by 13.3 percent to Rs 7,647&nbsp;crore with margin expansion of 20 bps at&nbsp;9.1&nbsp;percent compared to previous quarter.  On O2C basis, the company said total throughput has increased from 16.8 MMT to 18.2 MMT on QoQ basis due to improved product demand in Q3 and scheduled shutdown taken in Q2.  &amp;quot;The reorganised structure in O2C business will facilitate holistic and agile decision making and enable us to pursue attractive new opportunities for growth, with strategic partnerships with the best and the biggest in this business globally. The O2C platform will increasingly move further downstream and become closer to customers,&amp;quot; billionaire Mukesh Ambani.  Oil and Gas (Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production)  Oil and gas (exploration &amp;amp;amp; production) business reported a 21.4 percent sequential growth in revenue at Rs 431 crore in Q3FY21 due to higher commodity price realisation and incremental production from R-Cluster.  In December, Reliance Industries and BP started production from the R Cluster, ultra-deep-water gas field in block KG D6 off the east coast of India. Both are developing three deepwater gas projects in block KG D6&ndash; R Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ&ndash;which together are expected to meet around 15 percent of India's gas demand by 2023.  In fact, at the operating level,&nbsp;the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment&nbsp;turned profitable with EBITDA at Rs 4 crore (against loss of Rs 194 crore) and margin at 0.9 percent (against -54.6 percent) for the quarter ended December 2020.  Reliance said outstanding debt as on December 2020 was Rs 2,57,413 crore and cash &amp;amp;amp; cash equivalents were at Rs 2,20,524 crore. &amp;quot;Balance capital commitment receivables (on account of Rights issue) are in excess of quarterend net debt levels.&amp;quot;  RIL retained its domestic credit ratings of 'AAA/Stable' from CRISIL and 'AAA/Stable' from India Ratings, and an investment grade rating for its international debt from Moody&rsquo;s as 'Baa2' and 'BBB+' from S&amp;amp;amp;P.

Reliance Jio has also sought directions to the state and central governments to take necessary action including prosecution against the persons involved.  &amp;quot;Vested interests inimical to the petitioner and its parent company, Reliance Industries Limited and its affiliates with a view to advancing their own interests and agendas are actively engaged in spreading false rumours to the effect that Reliance and affiliates are somehow the beneficiary of the recent legislation passed by Parliament governing marketing of agricultural produce,&amp;quot; the writ petition said.  Following these developments, Reliance has gone nationalistic in a big way. Jio is the only telecom company which has not used Chinese equipments and Airtel and Voda-Idea have used majority Chinese equipment's.  Jio has built India's own indigenous 5G technology, a major step in the direction of Prime Ministers &amp;quot;AtmaNirbhar Bharat&amp;quot; agenda. Sources said this is not digestible to all the foreign forces, political parties aligned to such foreign interests and businesses who are opportunistic at the cost of nationalism and they are together acting as vested interests.  Reliance Jio has already complained to DoT and TRAI against Airtel and Voda-Idea. Sources say these are majority controlled by multinationals are playing a dirty game rather than fighting in open markets. They had played similar games in 2016 when Jio launched it's service by denying interconnect to their network. TRAI and DoT both have imposed penalties of Rs 3,000 crore on Airtel-Voda-Idea but for unknown reasons DoT is not acting to collect such high amount of penalties. This has emboldened them to take law in their hand again.  Reliance Retail is the only retail company providing support to small merchant retailers to survive against the onslaught of Amazon and Walmart like giant and big purse multinationals. These multinationals are interested in damaging Reliance Retail so that they can use their money power to destroy Indian small merchants and retailers and establish their dominance in India's large market, they are trying the East India company's methodology of divide and rule by making Indians fight with each other.  There are large corporates and having interest in corporate farming are diverting attention of nation by false propaganda and blaming Reliance where there is no truth.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

The protests have become ammunition in a political war, and the assets and reputation of large corporate organisations such as Reliance Industries are collateral damage.  Our democracy gives everyone the right to protest, whether or not we agree with their views. But this has to be within the laws of the land. The only way that the farmer movement can remain focused and gain traction is by following the law. Farmers are fast losing friends by choking up the highways leading to the National Capital Region inconveniencing the general population, let alone the vandalism in Punjab.  It is also unfortunate that farmers have dragged a company that has nothing to do with the farm sector into the protests. Large companies, irrespective of their contribution to the country&rsquo;s growth, development, and employment, seem fair game to anyone who wishes to fling mud at the government. Moreover, how can the farmers and their leaders justify the vandalism unleashed on RIL and its subsidiaries in Punjab and Haryana by way of damaging telecom towers?  In this instance, RIL has nothing to do with farms and contract farming, as it has said in a petition. Through its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL), in a petition filed at the&nbsp;Punjab and Haryana High Court on January 4,&nbsp;RIL said it has nothing whatsoever to do with the three farm laws and in no way benefits from them. As such, the sole nefarious purpose of linking the name of Reliance to these laws is to harm its businesses and damage its reputation.  RIL has further explained in the petition that it has not done any &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; or &ldquo;contract&rdquo;&nbsp;farming&nbsp;in the past, and has no plans&nbsp;to enter this business. &ldquo;Neither Reliance nor any of our subsidiaries have purchased any agricultural land,&nbsp;directly or indirectly, in Punjab/Haryana or anywhere else in India, for &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; or &ldquo;contract&rdquo; farming&rdquo; it said in a statement.  The company also said it has never entered into the long-term procurement contracts to gain an unfair advantage over farmers or sought that its suppliers buy from farmers at less than remunerative prices, nor will it ever do so.  The company has effectively staked its corporate reputation by making this statement to the courts and stock exchanges. A globally respected brand can ill afford to risk dilution, let alone the upkeep of its promise and what it has committed in the courts and to the regulator.  If farmers and their leaders are serious about the cause, they should focus their arguments against the government and take up the fight in the judiciary. Launching an unprovoked attack on corporate entities and individuals is nothing but pure theatrics.  Even if these are symbolic, they will only weaken the actual cause especially if the action brings economic loss, social unrest, and inconveniences the common man. It will prove detrimental to achieving the ultimate objective. In this case, the repeal of the three farm acts.  Vandalism can never be a means to a just end. More than 140 lakh RJio subscribers in Punjab and more than 40 lakh subscribers in Haryana, were incapacitated by the towers' attack. Who benefitted? Only the competitors of Reliance and a few vested interests.  Did it serve the purpose for which the farmers have been agitating for more than 40 days in the severe cold and rain? Certainly not. On the contrary, it will be seen as a loss of public property, which has nothing to do with three farms acts.  Allegations, till proven with facts and evidence in the courts, have no value. So, if farmer leaders are preaching that a few corporate actors are the architects behind the three farm acts, let them prove it in the courts and let the law take its course.  They should focus their attention and energy on the government if they wish to achieve what they have set out to do. If they can convince the government or courts, that the three farm acts are faulty, de facto, corporates become inconsequential.​  Disclosure:&nbsp;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd."

RIL&nbsp;said that its subsidiary&nbsp;Reliance Retail does not purchase food grains directly from farmers. &amp;quot;We shall insist on our suppliers to strictly abide by the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism, and/or any other mechanism for remunerative price for farm produce, as may be determined and implemented by the government,&amp;quot; Reliance said in the statement.  The company said it had &amp;quot;never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain unfair advantage over farmers or sought that its suppliers buy from farmers at less than remunerative prices, nor will it ever do so.&amp;quot;  In recent weeks, there have been reports of around 1,500 mobile towers and telecom gear owned by RIL&rsquo;s Jio being vandalised in Punjab, allegedly by farmers protesting against the new farm laws that seek to liberalise the market for agricultural produce and commodities.  The company said it has filed a writ petition in the Punjab&nbsp;and&nbsp;Haryana High Court against vandalism of its communication towers. It urged the High Court to issue a suitable order to help protect its employees and property from vandalism. Some vested interests and business rivals were behind the vandalism, the company said.  In November, some groups of farmers had shut down Reliance Fresh&nbsp;stores in parts of Punjab. Some farmers fear that the new laws will pave the way for corporate exploitation and their land could be &amp;quot;snatched&amp;quot; by big firms.  Follow LIVE updates of the farmers' protest here  Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana,&nbsp;have been&nbsp;staging a sit-in&nbsp;along Delhi's borders since November 26. The farmers are demanding a complete rollback of the three farm laws and a guarantee that the MSP system will not be done away with.  Multiple rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmers&rsquo; union leaders have ended in a stalemate. Protesting farmers fear that the new agricultural reform laws will dismantle the MSP system and corporatise farming. However, the Centre has maintained that these reforms will benefit farmers.  The Centre and farmers&rsquo; unions are scheduled to hold&nbsp;another round of talks&nbsp;on January 4.&nbsp;In the previous round, the Centre and farmer unions agreed on issues related to the electricity act and stubble burning but there was&nbsp;no&nbsp;agreement on the two key demands&mdash;legal guarantee for MSP and withdrawal of the three farm laws.
