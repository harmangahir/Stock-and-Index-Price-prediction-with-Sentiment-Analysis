It bought the Indian operations from Diana Retail, promoted by DLF Brands for USD 26 million (around Rs 175.52 crore).In another interesting deal, Future Retail acquired online furniture seller FabFurnish.com from its owner, Bluerock eServices Private (BEPL).Besides, Mahindra Retail merged operations of Babyoye, which had both online and offline presence, with that of FirstCry.com -- one of the larger online players in the maternity and babycare space.&amp;quot;The next couple of years will see more consolidation and a much greater maturity of omni-channel retail and sustainable retailing practices,&amp;quot; Retailers Association of India (RAI) CEO Kumar Rajagopalan told PTI.The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, which is making a significant push in telecom with Reliance Jio, also forayed into online retail with its fashion portal Ajio.com.However, gains made by retailers during the year came under pressure due to demonetisation.&amp;quot;Demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes had an immediate impact on retail, with sales of retailers seeing a plunge of up to 70 per cent in the first few days. Sales of large discretionary items like electronics too plunged.However, essential consumable goods by stores that accept cards/digital money saw an uptake,&amp;quot; Rajagopalan said.Giving outlook for the next year, Rajagopalan said impact of demonetisation will continue for the first few months of 2017.He, however, added that demonetisation served as a wake- up call for retailers that had not adopted modern retailing practices such as accounting every sale and accepting digital payments.&amp;quot;Demonetisation has opened up a host of opportunities for innovative partnerships between digital wallets and retailers to embrace digital technologies,&amp;quot; he said.2016 came as a delight for customers as foreign brands like Ted Baker, Scotch &amp;amp;amp; Soda, Izabel London and Simon Carter announced their entry into the Indian market."

RIL and its its partners BP Plc of the UK and Canada's Niko Resources, who had on November 11 slapped an arbitration notice against the government disputing the USD 1.55 billion demand, have named former UK high court judge Bernard Eder to the panel. &amp;quot;They (RIL-BP-Niko) named the arbitrator last month and the government has nominated Singhvi on the panel now,&amp;quot; a senior official said. The two arbitrators will now decide on a presiding judge of the three-member arbitration panel. The oil ministry had on November 3 issued a notice to RIL, Niko and UK's BP Plc seeking USD 1.47 billion for producing in the seven years ended March 31, 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal unit of gas that had seeped or migrated from the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal. After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources. The official said the arbitration will get underway once all the three-members are in place. The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee. The Shah panel, in its August 28 report, concluded that there has been &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML. The government, the official said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from RIL-BP-Niko for &amp;quot;the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained&amp;quot;. So, a notice was sent, he said, adding that the government is also pressing RIL to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than targets. The cost recovery issue is also being arbitrated separately. Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL. Under direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah however said the compensation should go to government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.Disclaimer: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is part of the Reliance Group."

While under the automatic route (ECB), major borrowers included Reliance Industries USD 184.28 million for refinancing of earlier ECB, Delhi International Airport USD 522.6 million for refinancing of rupee loans/earlier ECB; and Thermal Powertech Corporation India USD 246 million for other purposes. Dr Reddy's Laboratories raised USD 150 million for refinancing earlier ECB; IL&amp;amp;amp;FS Transportation Networks USD 50.0 million for general corporate purpose while Greenply Industries USD 47. 20 million and Essar Shipping USD 44.92 million for import of capital goods each. Those who raised money through RDB facility were HDFC Ltd and Fullerton India Credit USD 74.91 million each for on lending. ECL Finance USD 149.82 million for general corporate purpose from masala bonds.

IOC plans to import LPG at Kandla in Gujarat and move it through the 1,987 kilometer pipeline to Gorakhpur via Ahmedabad (in Gujarat), Ujjain, Bhopal (in Madhya Pradesh), Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi and Lucknow (in Uttar Pradesh). In comments on IOC proposal made to oil regulator PNGRB, RIL said it is &amp;quot;interested in meeting its own demand in the geographical areas that is serviced by this pipeline and seeks capacity access in the pipeline.&amp;quot; RIL said it wants to put in its own LPG, possibly produced at its Jamangar refineries in Gujarat, in the pipeline for transportation to hinterland. The pipeline will carry 3.75 million tons per annum of LPG, IOC said in an application to the sector regulator PNGRB seeking approval for laying the pipeline. Of this, 25 per cent will be common carrier capacity that can be provided to third parties. &amp;quot;As you are aware the Government is keen on rural penetration of LPG due to health, safety and environment (HSE) imperatives. RIL has been marketing (LPG) only in rural areas and would compete in predominantly rural areas serviced by this pipeline,&amp;quot; it said. Besides getting right to move its own LPG through the pipeline, RIL also wanted third party access to storages IOC will build along the pipeline route for stocking the gas before sent to bottling plants for filling in cylinders for sale to consumers. RIL said assistance at the allied storages proposed en route is vital for it to compete and rural penetration. &amp;quot;Since the facilities of storage also fall within the definition of 'Petroleum &amp;amp;amp; Petroleum Products Pipelines', we request that you declare all the facilities and the pipelines as 'common carrier',&amp;quot; RIL said in the letter to PNGRB. If needed, IOC should also provide facility for loading bulk trucks, cost of which can be recovered in pipeline transportation tariffs. The company, which owns refining capacity of 62 million tons, said aggregation of demand will help avoid infructuous investment in the parallel pipeline, bringing down the cost of transportation. &amp;quot;Access to RIL will also enhance rural penetration, one of the policy imperatives of the Government,&amp;quot; it added. IOC plans to feed LPG into the pipeline at Kandla port as well as its Koyali refinery in Gujarat. It will connect eight of IOC's LPG bottling plants in Central and Northern India. This will be the biggest LPG pipeline in the country. GAIL currently operates a 1,415-km line from Jamnagar in Gujarat to Loni near here. The line carries 2.5 million tons of LPG annually."

Financially strained Niko had in February last year announced plans to sell its 10 per cent stake in the KG-DWN- 98/3 or KG-D6 block to pay off USD 340 million debt. It had planned to sell off the interest by April 30, 2015 but later extended it to May 31 and then to September 15, 2015. It called the sale off apparently because it could not find a buyer. The firm's interim Chief Executive Robert Ellsworth said the company had &amp;quot;re-launched the sales process for our interest in the D6 Block&amp;quot; due to &amp;quot;favourable developments with respect to natural gas pricing applicable to the company's undeveloped deep water fields&amp;quot;. While gas from existing producing fields are priced at rate equivalent to price prevailing in gas surplus economies like Russia, US and Canada, the government has given a pricing freedom subject to a cap for undeveloped gas finds in deep-sea blocks. KG-D6 has several undeveloped gas discoveries. &amp;quot;As previously communicated to shareholders, the company is in the midst of a strategic plan to enhance the value of our core assets with the objective of ultimately monetising these assets for the benefit of the company's stakeholders,&amp;quot; he said in the earnings statement for the quarter ended September 30. RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with a 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK owns 30 per cent stake. Ellsworth said Niko believes the KG-D6 block offers &amp;quot;a number of compelling attributes to potential bidders&amp;quot; but the sale &amp;quot;will inevitably be complicated&amp;quot; by the USD 1.55 billion claim made by the government against the three firms in respect of gas reckoned to have migrated from neighbouring blocks of ONGC into D6. &amp;quot;While we believe the D6 Block offers a number of compelling attributes to potential bidders, the sales process will inevitably be complicated by the recent claim made by the Government of India against the contractor group of the D6 production sharing contract in respect of gas said to have migrated from neighbouring blocks to the D6 Block,&amp;quot; he said. Niko, he said, believes the contractor group is not liable for the amount claimed and &amp;quot;is working with the contractor group to defend against the claim by invoking the dispute resolution mechanism in the D6 Block production sharing contract.&amp;quot; RIL says the government's claim was based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the production sharing contract and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world. &amp;quot;The liability of the contractor has not been established by any process known to law and the quantification of the purported claim is without any basis and arbitrary,&amp;quot; it had stated after the government slapped a USD 1.55 billion demand notice for &amp;quot;unfairly enriching&amp;quot; by producing ONGC's share of gas.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which owns Network18, also publishes Moneycontrol.com."

Since both the ministry as well as the Shah panel had cited provisions of the signed PSC between the patners and the government, the issue may be headed for arbitration. RIL contests that it had knowingly produced any gas belonging to ONGC as all the wells it drilled were within the boundary walls of KG-D6 block and with explicit permission of the government. While RIL and partners are likely to contest the compensation claim, arbitration is likely to be resorted to as that is the dispute resolution mechanism set out under PSC for settling any differences between the government and a private contractor. The cost disallowance issue is already under arbitration. RIL did not offer any immediate comments but a BP spokesperson said: &amp;quot;We have received a letter from the government on the issue of migration of gas from the neighboring block.

RIL launched its telecom business under the Jio brand in September 2016.,,"4G, Business, Fitch, growth, Jio, petrochemical business, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/fitch-affirms-rils-ratingstable-outlookrobust-biz_7890181.html,"Fitch today affirmed Reliance Industries' rating at 'BBB-' with a stable outlook on robust refinery and petrochemical business as also &amp;quot;strong growth potential&amp;quot; in recently launched telecom venture. It said the robust operating cash flows from its refining and petrochemical businesses will provide some cushion against any weak cash generation from the telecom operations for some time. RIL launched its telecom business under the Jio brand in September 2016. Fitch Ratings has affirmed Reliance Industries' (RIL) Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-', and its Long-Term Local-Currency IDR at 'BBB'. The outlook on the ratings is 'stable', the US-based agency said in a statement. &amp;quot;RIL's ratings are supported by its strong business profile - a large-scale refinery with capacity of around 1.24 million barrels per day - and robust asset quality, which enables it to consistently deliver gross refining margins (GRM) above regional benchmarks. The company also has a strong market position in petrochemicals,&amp;quot; it said. Large investments nearing completion will further enhance the company's competitiveness in these areas, Fitch added. It said robust refining and petrochemical operations are supported by their large scale, asset quality and the company's leading position in the two segments. During the six months to September 30, RIL recorded Gross Refining Margin (GRM) of USD 10.8 per barrel. &amp;quot;We expect the GRM to narrow in the near term in line with the industry trends; although the commissioning of a gasification unit in FY'17 should result in a sustained increase in RIL's GRMs by around USD 1.5-2.5 per barrel,&amp;quot; it added. Fitch expects the benefits from its investments in the refinery and petrochemical operations to start accruing from 2017-18 and support improvement in its profitability and operational cash flows. &amp;quot;We also expect lower overall capex after FY'18 although the company may continue to invest in its telecom business,&amp;quot; it said, adding RIL has already planned a total capex of Rs 1.5 lakh crore for telecom business and acquired additional spectrum for Rs 13,700 crore in the recently held government auction in October 2016. Fitch said it expects strong growth potential in telecom business, and we expect RIL to be able to take advantage of the strong growth potential in the India telecom market. &amp;quot;RIL has invested significantly in its telecom infrastructure and expects to cover 90 per cent of the population by end-FY18. We expect the robust infrastructure along with its affordable 4G data offerings to support Jio's growth,&amp;quot; it said. Fitch said that Jio will face intense competition from the financially strong incumbent Indian telecom players, but falling data tariffs will support significant expansion of overall data consumption in India over the medium term. &amp;quot;We also expect Jio's wide range of offerings, including media and entertainment content (offered free till end-2017), to help in subscriber additions and data consumption, which will drive cash generation. Future capex relating to Jio will depend on the growth of its customer base,&amp;quot; it said.Disclosure: RIL owns Network18, which publishes moneycontrol.com."

India has traditionally been a net exporter of fuel oil, the residue oil left after initial crude refining that is typically used in shipping and power generation. That is about to change. Three state-run energy firms -- Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum -- plan to spend USD 20 billion on refinery expansions to add units by 2022 that would process fuel oil into gasoline and diesel, boosting their output to meet growing local demand for transport fuels. &amp;quot;Our fuel oil production will be less because everywhere we are going for residue upgrades,&amp;quot; said B. Ashok, Chairman of the country's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC). Private refiners Reliance Industries and Essar Oil have already invested heavily to build advanced refineries which produce gasoline at the expense of fuel oil. With state refiners now doing the same, India will soon have to sharply raise imports of fuel oil, two traders that participate in the market said. India's net fuel oil exports averaged 109,000 tonnes from April to September, according to the country's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, and the traders estimate this could flip into a need to raise fuel oil imports as early as late 2017. As a result, the price difference between diesel and fuel oil could narrow further from its current USD 17.61 a barrel, as Indian shipping fuel demand rises with the government's thrust on the coastal movement of cargoes, considered more cost efficient than road transport. &amp;quot;Already, gasoil and fuel oil differentials have started shrinking from about USD 30 three years ago to USD 16-USD 18 now and it is likely to narrow further as refiners are destroying fuel oil to produce gasoil and gasoline,&amp;quot; said S. Thangapandian, director at Gulf Petrochem. Indian refiners' expansion plans almost coincide with changing shipping fuel norms from 2020 requiring the use of low-sulphur fuels. IOC is the biggest expansion investor, planning to spend 500 billion rupees (USD 7.48 billion) by 2022 to raise its refining capacity by about 30 percent to 2.08 million barrels per day (bpd) including expanding its Panipat refinery in northern India to about 400,000 to 500,000 bpd. HPCL and BPCL plan to spend USD 11.25 billion to expand refineries and install fuel oil upgrading units, halting fuel oil output in almost all plants."

Net profit increased 1.5% QoQ and declined 22.1% YoY; QoQ rise is mainly on account of stable refining margins and higher production from refining and petchem segment. GRMs stood at USD 10.1/ barrel compared to USD 11.5/ barrel in Q1FY17 and USD 10.6 in Q2FY16. GRMs were lower because of decline in gasoline cracks. On a QoQ basis, gasoline cracks declined 34.3% and disel cracks declined 10.0%. Petchem EBIT increased by 21.8% QoQ and 35.5% YoY, as product deltas held up well despite lower prices along with higher volumes. Retail business has been consolidated and posted an EBIT of INR 1620 mn for the quarter up 9.5% QoQ and 42.1% YoY. Other income was up 0.63%% QoQ and 63.9% YoY to INR 23930 mn. RIL's outstanding debt was higher at INR 1891320 mn as on Sep 30, 2016 as compared to INR 1803880 mn as on Mar 31, 2016. Cash in the books stood at INR 825330 Vs INR 899960 mn in as on Mar 31, 2016. These were in bank deposits, mutual funds, CDs and Government Bonds and other marketable securities. The capital expenditure for the quarter ended Sep 2016 was INR 172100 mn (&amp;amp;#36; 2.6 billion) including exchange rate difference capitalization. Capital expenditure was principally on account of ongoing expansions projects in the petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar, Dahej and Hazira, Jio Infocomm and US Shale gas projects. We believe over the medium to long term refining margins to remain range bound as capacity additions though it is delayed will eventually match the demand growth. RIL will further gain from efficient crude sourcing and product placement. We expect RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s GRMs to be between &amp;amp;#36;10.0-11.5/bbl in FY17 (will go up by &amp;amp;#36;2.5/bbl post commissioning of petcoke regasification terminal). We expect margins to remain stable in petchem segment along with the petchem capacity addition and operational optimization. We also remain very positive on Jio and believe that all the issues related to inter connectivity will be sorted out.

LPG consumption is growing by over 10 per cent and private refiners RIL and Essar Oil want a pie of it. Currently, public sector retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum control retail LPG market, selling cooking gas in 5-kg, 14.2-kg and 19-kg cylinders. They sell 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg or 34 bottles of 5-kg per year to households on subsidised rates and any requirement above that on market price. The 19-kg cylinder is for commercial use. Private firms are not entitled for government subsidy and they have to sell fuel at market price. But with the government restricting volume of subsidy as well as barring consumers earning more than Rs 10 lakh per annum from subsidised LPG, a ready-made market is now available for private oil companies. &amp;quot;Mobile App rolled in all operating states to enhance customer experience,&amp;quot; RIL said in the presentation. The company sells most of the LPG produced by its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat to public sector retailers. While RIL did not disclose the price at which it is marketing the 4-kg cylinder, a 5-kg subsidised domestic LPG cylinder costs Rs 158.50 in Delhi. A 5-kg cylinder for domestic use is priced at Rs 181 while it costs Rs 252.50 for non-domestic use. A subsidised 14.2-kg cylinder costs Rs 427 in Delhi and a non-subsidised bottle comes for Rs 490. A 19-kg cylinder is priced at Rs 895. Domestic LPG consumption rose 10.8 per cent in April-September this year to 10.2 million tonnes, nearly half of which was imported. The government had last year permitted RIL to sell up to 1.2 lakh tonnes of LPG produced at its plants to private cooking gas marketers. The LPG Control Order mandates that all cooking gas (LPG) produced locally must be supplied to state-run fuel retailing companies as India is deficient in LPG and has to import a part of the requirement. However, under the Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers. &amp;quot;Packed LPG Business sales grew at 10 per cent year-on-year basis,&amp;quot; the company said in the presentation.

During the quarter, Reliance Retail added 59 stores across various store concepts, strengthened its distribution network for consumer electronics. The firm runs formats like Reliance Fresh, Reliance Super and Reliance Hyper and operates 3,442 stores across 679 cities in India.Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com."

India's richest man had stormed his way into the telecom sector last month announcing a 'Jio Welcome Offer' beginning September 4. The sector regulator TRAI in an order said as per regulations the free services by Jio will be limited to 90 days, which ends on December 3. &amp;quot;The revised offer of free services by Reliance Jio has been limited to 90 days i.e. December 3, 2016 and therefore is consistent with the guidelines on promotional offers,&amp;quot; TRAI said in an order. When contacted, a Jio spokesperson said, &amp;quot;benefits of&amp;amp;nbsp;free unlimited voice and data of 'Jio Welcome Offer' or 'JWO' will be available to all subscribers up to December 31, 2016. But, the JWO will be available to new consumers for subscription till December 3, 2016,&amp;quot; the spokesperson said. He said consumers who have not subscribed services till December 3 will be able to subscribe to New offers as well as tariff plans that are available from Jio. &amp;quot;Jio will continue offering consumer friendly plans to enhance data and voice experience of all consumers,&amp;quot; he added. Ambani while announcing the launch on September 1 had said that voice calling on Jio will be free for life and data would be charged at rock-bottom rates after the welcome offer ends. After the TRAI order, the company did not indicate the tariffs to be charged to users taking services after December 4. Incumbent operators like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone along with industry body COAI had approached the regulator against the new entrant's scheme of offering free calls and unlimited data access to consumers till December 31, 2016. They had also complained that given the free data offer, a &amp;quot;tsunami&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;asymmetric&amp;quot; traffic originating from Reliance Jio network was coming to their networks, leading to an increased number of call drops. However, the regulator said the submissions made have been examined and it is found that the tariff plans filed with TRAI cannot be considered as IUC non-complaint, predatory and discriminatory, at present. It added that the Authority would continue to keep a close watch on the tariffs being offered in the market by all players, including Reliance Jio.Disclosure: Reliance Jio is a part of Reliance Industries that owns Network 18 Media &amp;amp;amp; moneycontrol.com"

S&amp;amp;amp;P said RIL's spending of Rs 13,700 crore on the spectrum purchase was much higher than anticipated and reflects focus on meeting growth in data with adequate capacity and also the strong subscriber response to the launch of its Jio service in September 2016. The rating on Reliance Industries is unaffected by the company's large spectrum purchase, S&amp;amp;amp;P Global Ratings said in a statement. The US-based agency said RIL's brownfield and greenfield projects will soon start generating cash flows and support significant improvement in financial ratios. The company will continue to have financial ratios weaker than our expectations for the rating in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, it said. S&amp;amp;amp;P, which has a 'BBB+' rating on RIL with a stable outlook, said some uncertainty remains over the revenue and EBITDA that Jio will generate because it remains in the early stages of operations and is going to be free until December 31, 2016. The agency said RIL's energy business provides good cash flow visibility and will support significant improvement in financial ratios over the next two years. The commissioning of the energy projects, which comprise a petrochemical expansion project, an ethane import project, a petcoke gasification project, and a refinery off-gas cracker, will support the improvement. &amp;quot;We expect these projects to be commissioned over the next nine months and to generate annual incremental EBITDA of USD 2.5-3 billion by fiscal 2018. This will result in about a 50 per cent increase in energy business EBITDA, which has been about USD 6 billion annually over the last few years,&amp;quot; S&amp;amp;amp;P said. Reliance Industries which launched its mobile network Jio in September has achieved 16 million subscribers in its first month of operations, it said. &amp;quot;We have assumed telecom operations will register EBITDA of USD 1-1.5 billion in fiscal 2018 and USD 2.5-3 billion in fiscal 2019,&amp;quot; S&amp;amp;amp;P said.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network18, which owns and publishes moneycontrol.com)"

Jio, a new entrant in the 4G market, has achieved this growth faster than any other telecom operator or start-up in the world, including the likes of Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype, Reliance Jio Infocomm said in a release. &amp;quot;We are delighted and humbled by the overwhelming response across India to the Jio Welcome Offer. Jio is built to empower every Indian with the power of data,&amp;quot; said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Industries (RIL). &amp;quot;We are delighted that people have recognised this and are utilising our services to the fullest. We are customer-obsessed and committed to improving every day to exceed expectations of our customers.&amp;quot; Reliance Jio Infocomm is a subsidiary of RIL. It launched its commercial services on September 5. At RIL's 42nd annual general meeting, Ambani had said his new telecom venture would aim to acquire 100 million customers &amp;quot;in the shortest possible time and create a new world record&amp;quot;. This would translate into a data usage of 250 crore gigabyte per month, he had then said. Jio has introduced Aadhaar-based paperless Jio SIM activation across 3,100 cities and towns. This enables the customer to complete the SIM activation process in a matter of minutes, with only his/her Aadhaar number. &amp;quot;This process will be extended across the country and fully stabilised for satisfactory on-boarding experience in the next few weeks,&amp;quot; the release said. Jio, whose controversial entry into the world's second-largest telephony market sparked off a tariff war, had onboarded 1.5 million users on its 4G network during the test phase. It is competing head-on with players such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone by offering users data services free for four months from September 5, after which it will offer 10 tariff plans starting at Rs 19 a day for occasional data users, Rs 149 a month for low data users and Rs 4,999 a month for heavy data subscribers. Vodafone had over 200 million subscribers and Idea about 177 million subscribers in August while the subscriber count of Aircel stood at 89.7 million. Telenor's came in at 53.2 million and that of state-owned MTNL was about 3.6 million at August-end. Bharti Airtel's broadband base (3G+4G) read 35 million. Vodafone and Idea together as of date have 25 million broadband users. They achieved these numbers in about 15 years while Jio has got 16 million broadband users in less than a month. Jio may have 35 million 4G users by October-end, crossing Airtel's user base, industry observers said.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com."

This will be the fourth reduction in the last 18 months following the formula approved by the government in October 2014. Price of natural gas produced from the existing fields of ONGC and RIL is likely to fall to USD 2.5 per mmBtu with effect from October 1 as opposed to USD 3.06 currently, he said. &amp;quot;The price of normal domestic gas has been coming down because it is linked to gas price in certain markets. We have Canadian and the US price. They have been coming down,&amp;quot; he told reporters here. &amp;quot;We had started from USD 5.05, which used to be earlier USD 4.2 mmBtu. The current price is USD 3.06. As per the workings (calculations) which we have made, which will be effective October 1, it is going to be somewhere around or even less than USD 2.5 per mmBtu.&amp;quot; As per the new gas pricing formula approved by the NDA- government in October 2014, gas prices are to be revised every six months and the next change is due on October 1. The gas price was last slashed on April 1 to USD 3.06, from USD 3.82. On October 1 last year, the price of natural gas was lowered to USD 3.82, from USD 4.66. A price reduction on October 1 this year will put further pressure on finances of upstream producers that do not find the current rate higher enough to invest more in oil and gas hunt. &amp;quot;In terms of revenue, there will be a reduction of Rs 4,200 crore per dollar in a year. It translates into Rs 2,400 crore on the bottom line and Rs 4,200 crore on top line, Sarraf said. He went on to add that the government will support explorers if price is unremunerative. &amp;quot;I have full confidence that if our exploration or exploitation is not viable at USD 2.5 per mmBtu, then the government would definitely consider increase in price like they did for difficult fields,&amp;quot; he said. The government had earlier this year approved marketing and pricing freedom for all undeveloped discoveries in difficult areas subject to a cap.

Reliance Industries Ltd's telecom arm has announced free lifetime voice calls and roaming services for its users along with data charges at about one-tenth of the prevailing rates. The company is targeting 100 million subscribers in shortest possible time, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani said yesterday while unveiling the 4G service. While market watchers described the move as a &amp;quot;knockout punch&amp;quot;, they also feel that incumbents (like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular) are likely to formulate a new pricing and marketing strategy over the next few days to protect market share. &amp;quot;We believe R-Jio would need 75-80 million subscribers with an average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 180 for EBITDA break-even over the next 2-3 years - execution and customer care is the key,&amp;quot; IDFC Securities said in a note. It added that growth for RJio would primarily be driven by market share shift from fringe players and modest gain from incumbents, who have a relatively weak data footprint. Goldman Sachs expects RJio to hit EBIDTA break-even by FY 2019-20 with 75 million subscribers. The current monthly data usage in India is between 600- 900MB, say industry watchers. Given RJio's aggressive pricing structure, its strategy is to drive up ARPUs through higher usage. Another brokerage, Motilal Oswal said a subscriber base of 75 million with an ARPU of Rs 244 would help RJio generate revenues of about Rs 18,400 crore, but remain loss-making at EBITDA level (Rs 1,580 crore). &amp;quot;Assuming 400 minutes of usage (MOUs in line with Bharti) and 80 per cent off-net calls for the 100 million subscriber target indicated by RJio, annual interconnect cost to be borne by RJio works out to be Rs 5,300 crore...We expect RJio to break even in the third year at EBITDA level,&amp;quot; it added. Analysts also expect to see 20-25 per cent drop in voice and data realisation for incumbents over the next four quarters. They said the incumbent players will eventually move to bundled plans with unlimited voice, which could hurt revenue growth rates. Interestingly, Edelweiss Securities said it does not expect incumbents to match RJio's unlimited voice offering, but instead exploit large gaps in price points to target specific users. &amp;quot;With only 2 packages priced under Rs 500, which are likely to accommodate maximum number of users, we expect incumbents to offer multiple packages in this band to target different set of users to minimise churn,&amp;quot; it added. It added however that users would perceive more value in RJio due to the unlimited offerings and free usage till December 2016, leading to strong demand for its services.

Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, took the wraps off the Jio network on Thursday touting free calls and rock-bottom data prices that sent shares of established players into a nosedive on fears of an all-out price war. &amp;quot;RJio has disrupted industry pricing more than we imagined, with consequences for incumbents likely more difficult than we expected,&amp;quot; said George, who trimmed his price target on Bharti Airtel to Rs 290 from Rs 335, and that on Idea Cellular to Rs 85 from Rs 100. Idea shares were down nearly 3 percent in early trading, while India's largest wireless player Airtel slid less than a percent. Shares of Reliance Communications, the telecom venture run by Mukesh's younger brother Anil Ambani, also fell 1.7 percent. &amp;quot;We have been concerned over Jio's launch for a couple of years, and the event is turning out to be as negative as we had feared,&amp;quot; Credit Suisse analyst Sunil Tirumalai wrote in a note.

The government has disallowed USD 2.756 billion of the cost RIL and its partners had sunk in the flagging Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, for missing gas production target for five fiscal years beginning April 1, 2010. The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) allows RIL and its partners BP plc and Canada's Niko Resources to deduct all capital and operating expenses from the sale of gas before sharing profit with the government. Disallowing costs results in government's profit share going up. Consequent to disallowing USD 2.756 billion cost, the government has claimed additional profit petroleum of USD 246.9 million from the three. RIL and its partners have challenged the cost disallowance through an international arbitration insisting that the output fall was not its doing but a natural phenomenon. &amp;quot;And we are very confident of finding an acceptable solution. So we will work constructively, we will not give up our legal rights and we expect the results in consultation with our partner BP as we have to respect our partnership... and I want to assure you that business has long term value,&amp;quot; Ambani said. Besides the cost recovery arbitration, RIL is also locked with the government in another arbitration over deferring of a natural gas price hike due to the company from April 1, 2014. The company and BP are reportedly are keen to end that arbitration to get the advantage of getting market price for KG-D6 and other discoveries. The government had mandated that any company seeking to get market price for natural gas produced from difficult areas like deepsea should withdraw all legal challenges raised over gas pricing policy.

Currently, the average 1 GB data plan costs Rs 150-250.1.05 pm: However, analysts say there are concerns over&amp;amp;nbsp;whether&amp;amp;nbsp;Rel Jio's data-optimised network would be able to weather the load of free calls.1.00 pm: Back of the envelope&amp;amp;nbsp;calculation&amp;amp;nbsp;suggests that Airtel, Vodafone and Idea have about 64 crore customers between them, which may contribute about Rs 80,000 crore by way of voice revenues (assuming&amp;amp;nbsp;average revenue of about Rs 130 per user).By waiving call charges forever, Reliance Jio has put that much&amp;amp;nbsp;revenues at risk only between the top three operators. In all, India has a little over 100 crore users.12.52 pm: Financial analysis now coming in&amp;amp;nbsp;from experts. The takeaways?&amp;amp;nbsp;Thousands of crores of voice revenues for incumbents is at risk. The viability of Reliance Jio's own pricing strategy being questioned by some. Consolidation is inevitable. Only three-four operators will survive over the long term.12.45 pm: Market analyst SP&amp;amp;nbsp;Tulsian says&amp;amp;nbsp;that the Jio tariff couldn't have been more aggressive. &amp;quot;If Reliance Jio gets about 12 crore users by FY18 and the average revenue per user is about Rs 500, it translates into revenues of about Rs 70,000 crore. But I wonder if&amp;amp;nbsp;there will be profits.&amp;quot;12.40 pm: &amp;quot;The whole paradigm has changed, now that voice has been made free,&amp;quot; he admits. &amp;quot;It is good for the customers.&amp;quot;Telcos, however, earn about Rs 2,500-3,000 crore through&amp;amp;nbsp;interconnect revenues.12.37 pm: Mathews says that the September 5 launch, as in effect, should be treated as commercial launch. &amp;quot;Never before has a test launch been attempted on this magnitude and with so many customers.&amp;quot;12.34 pm: &amp;quot;The price points are very aggressive but not totally detrimental to the industry,&amp;quot; says COAI&amp;amp;nbsp;Director-General&amp;amp;nbsp;Rajan Mathews.COAI is the body of existing&amp;amp;nbsp;telecom companies that has been at loggerheads with Reliance Jio over the issue of spectrum charges and the contentious issue of interconnection ports&amp;amp;nbsp;and whether Reliance's preview offers are within the regulatory ambit.12.31 pm: &amp;quot;This is destructive competition at the outset,&amp;quot; says fund manager UR Bhat. Voice calls, on which Jio has promised to waive off charges forever, contribute about 70 percent to telecom company.12.30 pm: Reactions now coming in&amp;amp;nbsp;to Jio's announcements today.12.29 pm: Ambani is now talking about Reliance Foundation and Nita Ambani's elevation to the RIL board.12.25 pm:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;I am confident that the retail will become&amp;amp;nbsp;a major pillar for Reliance Group,&amp;quot; says Ambani.12.23 pm:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Reliance Digital is the undisputed leader in the consumer electronics business.&amp;quot;12.22 pm: Reliance Fresh and Reliance Mart continue to be India's preferred destinations for grocery.&amp;amp;nbsp;Our cash-and-carry Reliance Market serves thousands of retailers.12.21 pm: Reliance Retail&amp;amp;nbsp;has become India's&amp;amp;nbsp;most admired,&amp;amp;nbsp;largest and most profitable retail chain.12.19 pm: &amp;quot;Our channels reached out to 500 million viewers last year,&amp;quot; he said.12.16 pm: The RIL chairman is now talking about its media business, which it acquired with its Network18 buyout.12.14 pm:&amp;amp;nbsp;Ambani now talks about the company's mammoth petcoke gasification project, which will help it produce syngas. &amp;quot;This is the world's largest project of this scale.&amp;quot;12.12 pm: &amp;quot;Reliance delivered yet another robust year with over 40 percent EBIT growth.

The one-man Committee headed by Ajit Prakash Shah, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, submitted to Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan a report containing not just the compensation to be paid for ONGC's gas migrating to adjacent KG-D6 block of RIL in the Krishna Godavari basin, but also recommendations for avoiding such disputes in future. As much as 11.122 billion cubic meters of ONGC gas had migrated from its Godavari-PML and KG-DWN-98/2 blocks to adjoining KG-D6 of RIL between April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2015. At prevailing prices, the gas was worth Rs 11,000 crore. While ONGC's reservoirs have almost emptied, RIL continues to produce gas from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in KG-D6 block, some of it being of ONGC. Refusing to divulge contents of his report, Shah said the report is &amp;quot;comprehensive&amp;quot; and addresses all terms of references. &amp;quot;The Committee has also recommended future course of action for the ministry,&amp;quot; he said. Pradhan said the ministry has one month to decide on the report. &amp;quot;Government will take appropriate action,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Justice AP Shah has submitted a comprehensive report on gas migration issue. He has preliminary briefed us on report,&amp;quot; he said without giving details. The panel has given &amp;quot;some observations&amp;quot; on the report of the independent expert DeGolyer &amp;amp;amp; MacNaughton (D&amp;amp;amp;M) that established reservoir continuity between the KG-D6 and contiguous ONGC operated blocks. Asked if the Shah panel, like the D&amp;amp;amp;M report, had established that gas from ONGC block had migrated to KG-D6 fields, Pradhan said, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; The Shah Committee has &amp;quot;detailed economic and legal implications&amp;quot; of the gas migration under the signed Production Sharing Contract, he said, adding that the report would be made public after the ministry has studied it. &amp;quot;Allow me to get back to you with detailing of the report,&amp;quot; he said. D&amp;amp;amp;M had in its November 2015 report indicated that as on March 31, 2015, 44.32 per cent of the gas initially in place in Godavari PML and 34.71 per cent in KG-DWN-98/2 (both of ONGC) had migrated to KG-D6 of RIL. The report projected a higher proportion of gas migration and its production through RIL operated KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) block by end of 2019. Pradhan said he had asked the Shah Committee was asked to look into legal, financial and contractual provisions on the gas migration row. It was also asked to report any &amp;quot;acts of omission and commission&amp;quot; on part of all the stakeholders including RIL, ONGC, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons and the government, he said.Disclosure: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is a part of the Reliance Group."

RIL has an integrated refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Jamnagar district with a marine terminal in the Gulf of Kutch that has five single-point mooring (SPMs) and a liquid jetty comprising five liquid berths to facilitate supply of crude oil to the refinery and evacuate the products manufactured. To handle more products, the company has proposed expansion of its existing liquid jetty by setting up an additional berth of capacity to handle about 8 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa). RIL's proposal was examined at a recent meeting by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) under the Union Environment Ministry. &amp;quot;EAC has recommended the ministry to grant environment and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearances to the RIL's proposal to expand its jetty facility at Jamnagar in Gujarat,&amp;quot; a senior government official said. The panel also suggested the ministry to stipulate specific conditions, along with other environmental conditions, while considering accord of environmental clearance, the official said. The company plans to complete the expansion in two years after the grant of final green clearance from the ministry. The cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 750 crore. Among specific conditions, EAC has suggested that the company should not carry out any construction activity in the eco-sensitive area. RIL should ensure there is no damage to the existing mangroves patches near the site and there is free flow of water to avoid damage to the mangroves. It has also been told to undertake additional mangrove plantation in 100 hectares. It has been told to take steps so that no creeks or rivers are blocked due to any activity at the project site and free flow of water is maintained, besides regularly monitoring the marine ecology. The company has been asked to comply with the commitments made during the public hearing. According to RIL, the proposed berth will be established within coastal waters off the Gulf of Kutch and will be the part of the existing captive terminal.Disclosure: Reliance Industries has acquired management control of Network18, which owns TV18 Broadcast and moneycontrol.com."

Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJIL), a unit of Reliance Industries, said absence of incumbent operators to provide it points of inter-connection (PoIs) -- connection between their facilities, equipment and network -- led to unusually high call failures during its beta run. The Mukesh Ambani-run firm on August 12 wrote to Trai Chairman R S Sharma saying the dominant operators under the aegis of COAI has &amp;quot;categorically mentioned that its member operators (which incidentally include Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea) shall not be expected to provide PoIs to RJIL during the test trials&amp;quot;. The unequivocal denial to provide PoIs, it said, was a &amp;quot;blatant breach of the licence agreement&amp;quot;. The licence agreement provides for obligation of the licensee to provide inter-connection facilities to other licensees. &amp;quot;It may be pertinent to note that the obligation of a licensee to provide PoIs is absolute and not contingent on any other factors, including any traffic imbalance or the licensee not having announced commercial launch,&amp;quot; said RJIL, which since December has been doing test runs for its pan-India high-speed 4G network in preparation of a commercial launch. The company said it is following payment terms for such inter-connection and inter-connection usage charge (IUC) set by Trai in respect to test users. Arguing that inter-connection between service providers is the basis of a telecom network, Reliance Jio said it is necessary that requisite PoIs, which are required to maintain minimum quality of service to ensure calls are completed to all destinations, must be unconditionally facilitated inter se between all operators, subject alone to payment of relevant IUC charges. &amp;quot;The current number of PoIs provided or being provided to RJIL are far from adequate and this is more than evident from the fact that the current call failure rate is in excess of 65 per cent, resulting in more than 1.6 crore call failures per day between RJIL and the networks of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea,&amp;quot; it said. It expressed concern that this situation will only get worse without expediting the requisite PoI augmentation. Reliance Jio submitted that there was no legal or any other basis for the operators to deny or even delay the provisioning of PoIs for inter-connection. It asked Trai to immediately direct the operators, including members of COAI, to provide PoIs to Reliance Jio without any demur or delay. Also, it should &amp;quot;take any or all applicable action/s against the errant telecom service providers (TSPs) for any continued denial or delay in the provisioning of PoIs to RJIL and subsequent breach of the respective licences,&amp;quot; it added.Disclosure: Reliance Jio is a part of Reliance Industries that owns Network 18 Media &amp;amp;amp; moneycontrol.com"

This will be the fourth reduction in last 18 months following the formula approved by the government in October 2014. Price of natural gas produced from existing fields of ONGC and RIL is likely to fall to USD 2.45 per million British thermal unit with effect from October 1 as opposed to USD 3.06 currently, a senior official said. This rate is on gross calorific value (GCV) basis. The gas price was last cut on April 1 from USD 3.82 per mmBtu to USD 3.06 per mmBtu. On a net-calorific value (NCV) basis, the gas price was on that day cut to USD 3.4 per mmBtu as compared to USD 4.24 previously. On NCV basis, the new gas price is likely to be USD 2.7 from October 1. As per the new gas pricing formula approved by the NDA- government in October 2014, gas prices are to be revised every six months and the next change is due on October 1. The reduction in natural gas prices would mean lower raw material cost for compressed natural gas (CNG) and natural gas piped to households (PNG) and would translate into reduction in retail prices. This will be the fourth consecutive reduction since the implementation of the domestic gas pricing formula that calculates the rate on a volume weighted average of rates in gas surplus nations of the US, Canada and Russia, based on the 12-month trailing average price with a lag of three months. The price of gas has declined by around 39 percent since the implementation of the gas pricing formula in October 2014. On October 1, 2015 price of natural gas was lowered to USD 3.82 per mmBtu from USD 4.66. The price cut on October 1, 2016 will put further pressure on finances of upstream producers who do not find the current rate incentivising enough to invest more in oil and gas hunt. The official said the cap price based on alternative fuels for undeveloped gas finds in difficult areas like deep sea will also fall to around USD 5.2-5.3 per mmBtu from USD 6.61 currently. The government had earlier this year approved marketing and pricing freedom for all undeveloped discoveries lying in difficult areas subject to a cap. The cap for April 1 to September 30 was USD 6.61 per mmBtu on GCV basis and USD 7.3 on NCV basis, the official said."

Side-track campaign has also been initiated in MA field. Sources said the existing and enhanced production from these fields only get the price as per the formula that was approved in November 2014. Price according to this formula currently is USD 3.06 per million British thermal unit and is expected to be revised lower in October 2016. At these prices, leave alone new investment, even the base business will struggle to yield any profits, they said. Sources said RIL-BP have started working towards developing R- Series and satellite discoveries.

Improvement in earnings was aided by stronger gross refining margins (GRM) and higher product spreads in the petrochemical business,&amp;quot; it said. The company earned USD 11.5 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel compared to a GRM of USD 10.8 per barrel in the immediately preceding quarter while the Singapore benchmark slipped to USD 5 from USD 7.7 per barrel over the same period. &amp;quot;RIL's GRM out-performed the regional benchmark by USD 6.5 a barrel during the quarter which was the highest in the last eight years,&amp;quot; Moody's Investors Service said. The improvement in RIL's gross refining margin was mainly attributable to the weakness in fuel oil cracks. A crack is the profit margin between the refined products (in this case fuel oil) and crude oil. Its Jamnagar refineries in Gujarat produces no or negligible amount of fuel oil as a result of which a weakness in fuel cracks is favorable for RIL's refining margins. Improvement in gasoil cracks during the quarter also supported RIL's GRMs. &amp;quot;We expect RIL's GRM to improve by another USD 2 per barrel, once it completes its ongoing projects within the energy business by fiscal 2017 while the Singapore complex is expected to remain range bound within USD 5-6 over the next 4 -6 months,&amp;quot; Moody's said. On a year-on-year basis, RIL reported an earnings growth of 17 percent in April-June backed by earnings improvement in the refining and petrochemical segment. &amp;quot;As RIL continues to invest towards its ongoing projects in the energy and consumer businesses, borrowings remain on an uptrend,&amp;quot; it said adding the company's net debt increased to Rs 95,900 crore as of June 2016 compared to Rs 90,400 crore in March 2016. Moody's said it expects RIL's credit metrics to improve once the ongoing projects are complete and start contributing to earnings over the next 12-18 months. &amp;quot;We expect fiscal 2018 to be the first full year for cash flows coming in from the next projects,&amp;quot; it said. RIL's petrochemical business saw an earnings growth of 4 percent during the June quarter. Improvement in earnings was attributable to increased polymer demand which boosted product deltas. Higher natural rubber prices led to increased demand for synthetic rubber which in turn led to higher elastomer. On a y-o-y basis, the petrochemical segment saw a 20 percent growth in earnings backed by higher production volumes. &amp;quot;We expect earnings from the petrochemical segment to improve further as the company completes its ongoing expansion within the petrochemical segment over the next 12-18 months,&amp;quot; it added."

Majority of brokerage houses retained their buy rating on the stock, saying its downstream expansion and Reliance Jio launch will be next key triggers. With maintaining buy rating, Goldman Sachs says it likes RIL's exposure to three themes - high refining complexity, high gasoline yield and organic earnings growth. The brokerage house has increased earnings per share estimates for FY17-19 by 3.4 percent/0.4 percent/0.5 percent to reflect Q1 results and also raised target price to Rs 1,160 from Rs 1,145 earlier. CLSA has also reiterated its conviction buy on the stock, saying start of over USD 30 billion projects in 6-9 months is a key potential share-price catalyst. The brokerage house expects the company's 2HFY17 to be action packed. &amp;quot;Reliance reiterated that its downstream expansions are on track to achieve 100 percent utilisation in FY18 as they start in the next few months with Paraxylene coming in Q2 and remaining projects in 2HFY17. Jio is in the final stage of optimising the 800MHz band in 18 of its 22 circles and the service may be nearing commercial launch. Reliance believes that Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s network can easily handle well over 100 million subscribers with data usage of 5GB per month,&amp;quot; CLSA says in its note. Of Reliance's Q1 consolidated capitalisation of Rs 26,700 crore, Rs 8,000 crore is on downstream expansions and Rs 13,000 crore on telecom, which takes total balance sheet size of Reliance Jio to Rs 1.34 lakh crore. However, consolidated net debt fell marginally to USD 14.2 billion. Reliance Industries' first quarter earnings beat analysts' expectations with the highest ever standalone profit at Rs 7,548 crore, growing 4.4 percent compared with preceding period on the back of robust refining margin. Gross refining margin surged to USD 11.50 a barrel in Q1 from USD 10.8 a barrel in March quarter, which was much ahead of USD 9.5-10.3 a barrel estimated by analysts, though the company indicated that there were exceptional gains of nearly USD 2 a barrel during the quarter due to product crack hedging/inventory gains. Nomura has remained positive on the stock given optimistic view on its core refining and petchem business. Over the next three years, it estimates an ex-telecom EBITDA CAGR of 11 percent driven by petchem /refining projects. With its buy recommendations on the stock, Deutsche Bank says over the next six to nine months, RIL should commission projects with investments of USD 38 billion (75 percent of its market cap), adding contribution from capacity additions in its core business and robust downstream margins should drive EBITDA (excluding telecom) growth of over 50 percent in FY16-18. Commissioning of petcoke gasifier should be in 2HFY17 and ethylene off-gas cracker in Q3FY17. Paraxylene (PX) capacity should be commissioned in Q2/Q3FY17, the brokerage says.

On year-on-year basis, this was a massive 50.12 per cent spike from Rs 1,584 crore the company reported in June 2015 quarter when its net profit stood at Rs 5,916 crore. The same stood at Rs 1,953 crore in the March 2016 quarter on a total net profit of Rs 6,925 crore. When asked whether the company has been increasing its play in the treasury market or has it booked some profits from its massive investments, RIL deputy chief financial officer V Srikanth told PTI that the numbers reflect the higher yields the market has been returning during the quarter. While refusing to share the specifics of the company's investment in government bonds, Srikanth said RIL for long has been parking its surpluses, which stood at almost Rs 97,000 crore as of end June, in government bonds, mutual funds, fixed deposits and other fixed income instruments. And the same continued in the reporting quarter as well. RIL, which is one of the biggest players in the treasury markets, was netting over 40 per cent of its total net profit from treasury gains or other income, which started declining after the banking regulator began to frown upon corporates' large influence in the money and government debt markets. Reliance, which has the highest cash balance, is also one of the highly indebted companies in the country.

Accordingly, the company's interest payout jumped to Rs 1,206 crore from Rs 915 crore a year ago and from Rs 842 crore from the March quarter. About the forex components of the debt pile, Srikanth said over 90 per cent of RIL bet is in US dollars while almost the entire Rs 47,000 crore debt of Rel Jio is rupee-denominated. RIL, which operates the world's largest oil refinery with a 63 mt annual capacity, today reported a hefty 18.1 per cent jump in June quarter net profit at Rs 7,113 crore or Rs 24.1 per share on account of highest refining margin in the past eight years and robust petrochemical earnings.Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com."

The company has been awarded exploratory rights for hydrocarbons prospecting in the offshore block DY-III-D5 under the New Exploration Licensing Policy-III. RIL has already been given the environment clearance to drill 11 exploratory wells in this block. As on date, Reliance Industries has drilled nine wells and discovered hydrocarbons in three wells. Since seismic data and the drilling campaign shows presence of hydrocarbons in the block, RIL is planning to carry out 8 additional exploratory well drilling to establish the reservoir capacity. &amp;quot;Based on the recommendation of the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), the Environment Ministry on June 30 gave environment clearance for the RIL's exploratory drilling project in Tamil Nadu,&amp;quot; a senior government official said. The clearance to the Rs 800 crore project has been given subject to certain conditions, the official added. Among key conditions specified, RIL has been asked to ensure gas produced during the testing should be flared with appropriate flaring booms. It should also ensure that there is no impact on flora and fauna due to drilling of wells in the offshore sea. It should undertake conservation measures to protect the marine animals/biota in the region. The company should monitor the petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals concentration in the marine fish species regularly and submit report to the government. Among others, the Panel suggested that all the hazardous waste generated at the rig/offshore facility should be properly treated, transported to on shore and disposed of in accordance with the norms. The company has also been asked to take permission from the Shipping Ministry for commencement of the drilling operations. Reliance forayed into the exploration and production business by partnering British Gas in an unincorporated joint venture in Panna Mukta and Mid and South Tapti blocks, where it holds 30 per cent stake. Besides Panna Mukta and Tapti blocks, their domestic portfolio comprises of five conventional oil and gas blocks in Krishna Godavari, Mahanadi, Cauvery Palar, Gujarat Saurashtra and Cambay Basin and two Coal Bed Methane blocks in Sohagpur East and West in Madhya Pradesh.

Previously the company had largely invested in mutual funds.",,"Banks, Barclays, Bonds, Business, cash holdings, government bonds, Larsen and Toubro, Reliance Industries, Reserve Bank of India, rupees, State Bank of India, Tata Consultancy Services",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/cash-rich-firms-may-deepen-govt-bond-mktspur-volatility_6845681.html,"India's largest information technology company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has become the third conglomerate to invest large cash holdings in government bonds, a trend that could boost the young debt market but also stir volatility. TCS ploughed USD 3 billion into the market from January to March, its annual balance sheet showed last month, shifting funds that totalled 80 percent of its surplus cash position. Previously the company had largely invested in mutual funds. TCS is the third company to have meaningful investment in government securities after Reliance Industries and construction firm Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro, which traders say is diversifying a USD 665 billion market dominated by banks and could portend a new investment trend for the country's conglomerates. &amp;quot;I expect more cash-rich companies to invest in government bonds as these are more liquid and carry a much better credit risk,&amp;quot; said Anindya Das Gupta, head of local markets trading at Barclays in India. However, this trend could create new risks, namely the volatility that a conglomerate selling a large amount of government bonds at once could create. When contacted by Reuters, TCS declined comment. While many banks have larger holdings, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates both banks and the bond market and thus can ensure that banks sell their holdings in a way that does not disrupt the market. The central bank has no sway over conglomerates as it does not regulate them. The RBI is happy for the investor base in government bonds to diversify, a senior policymaker said, and will monitor the market for any instances of manipulation or volatility tied to these investments. &amp;quot;There is nothing as of now which raises any alarm from such large purchases but we will monitor these entities closely as they are not the regular investors in this market,&amp;quot; said the policymaker, who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Indian companies could become bigger players in the government securities market as they confront the problem of what to do with growing cash stockpiles. The country's top six cash-rich companies have amassed around 1.7 trillion rupees (USD25.5 billion) worth of cash holdings, according to Reuters calculations, at a time when private capital spending is weak and bad loans are on the rise. As with TCS, most companies put their money in mutual funds, corporate bonds and bank deposits, which are losing their appeal versus government bonds in terms of both returns and safety. Investing via mutual funds entails an average fee of about 100 basis points of assets under management, according to debt fund managers and bankers. One-year bank deposits, at the country's largest lender State Bank of India which holds the largest amount of corporate deposits, yields 7.25-7.50 percent compared with nearly 7.5 percent for benchmark 10-year governments bonds. Das Gupta of Barclays said the narrower spread between bank deposits and 10-year bonds could be one reason companies buy &amp;quot;liquid and safe&amp;quot; government bonds. &amp;quot;On a risk-adjusted basis, the total return from a sovereign security has been much better than any other asset class like fixed deposits, mutual funds,&amp;quot; said Ashish Vaidya, executive director and head of trading at DBS Bank in Mumbai. Government bonds have rallied in the past year as the RBI has cut interest rates by 150 basis points to a five-year low of 6.50 percent. Further gains, however, may now be capped given that the RBI is expected to cut the repo rate only once more this year and inflationary risks have risen. Reliance Industries, India's biggest energy firm, has outstanding government bond investments worth 79.21 billion rupees as of March 2015, according to its 2014/15 annual report. Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro held 14.7 billion rupees of government bonds as of March 2015. It has yet to publish its annual report for 2015/16.Disclosure: Reliance Industries has acquired management control of Network18, which owns TV18 Broadcast and moneycontrol.com."

This will help return RIL's financial leverage back to levels comfortable for the rating,&amp;quot; S&amp;amp;amp;P said in a note. On the stable outlook, the agency said, &amp;quot;It reflects our expectation that RIL's leverage will significantly improve over the next two years with the debt-to-Ebitda ratio close to 2 times. &amp;quot;It also shows our expectation that RIL will continue to maintain its operating performance, and its competitive position will be supported by timely commissioning of large projects in refinery and petrochemical business over the next 12 months.&amp;quot; The agency further said it expects improvement in RIL's operating performance over the next three years from commissioning of large refinery and petrochemical projects as well as rollout of its much-delayed telecom operations, S&amp;amp;amp;P's Global Ratings Analyst Mehul Sukkawala said. He expects RIL to report an Ebitda CAGR of about 23 percent over the next three years as the low oil prices have already helped its operating performance. RIL is close to commissioning its multi-billion dollar expansion of its petrochemical project, ethane import project, a petcoke gasification unit, and a refinery off-gas cracker facility over the next 12 months. &amp;quot;We believe improvement in operating performance will enable RIL to reduce its leverage over the next three years.

RIL's overseas arm Reliance Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production DMCC owned 76 percent stake in GAPCO while Fortune Oil Corp, Mauritius held the remaining. Total is acquiring stake of both the firms. &amp;quot;Reliance Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production DMCC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of RIL and Total, have executed agreements on May 30, 2016 for the sale of the entire 76 percent interest held by REPDMCC in the Mauritius-incorporated Gulf Africa Petroleum Corporation (GAPCO),&amp;quot; RIL said in a statement. The proposed transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions that are customary for similar transactions. It, however, did not disclose the deal size. GAPCO is a holding company incorporated in Mauritius with affiliates in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania which are primarily engaged in petroleum product import and trading, storage, distribution, marketing, supply and transportation of oil products in East Africa. On conclusion, Total will get ownership of two logistical terminals in Mombasa in Kenya and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, as well as a retail network of over 100 service stations. The acquisition will be complementary to Total's existing operations in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania and will strengthen its logistics in the region.

The net proceeds for the sale will be finalised on completion of the transaction which is expected to be within the coming months, it added. RIL said the agreement signed by Reliance Exploration and Production DMCC (REPDMCC) to sell its interest in GAPCO was part of a joint transaction, wherein both REPDMCC and the minority shareholder have agreed to sell their entire respective holdings in for cash. &amp;quot;This acquisition is in line with Total's growth strategy for the distribution of petroleum products and services in Africa, which aims at expanding in fast-growing regions while maintaining high profitability,&amp;quot; said Momar Nguer, President, Total Marketing &amp;amp;amp; Services. The assets acquired, which complement Total's activities in East Africa, will help the firm fully &amp;quot;leverage synergies of size and build the most competitive integrated regional supply, logistics and marketing base,&amp;quot; he added.

Reliance Industries has been awarded exploratory rights for hydrocarbons prospecting in the offshore block DY-III-D5 under the New Exploration Licensing Policy-III. RIL has already been given the environment clearance to drill 11 exploratory wells in this block. As on date, the company has drilled nine wells and discovered hydrocarbons in three wells. Since seismic data and the drilling campaign shows presence of hydrocarbons in the block, RIL is planning to carry out eight additional exploratory well drilling to establish the reservoir capacity in this block. &amp;quot;In a recent meeting, the Expert Appraisal Committee of the Environment Ministry examined the proposal. After detailed deliberations, the committee recommended the project for environment clearance,&amp;quot; a senior government official said. The Committee has recommended the Ministry to give final clearance to RIL's project subject to certain specific and general conditions, the official added. Among key conditions specified, the Panel has suggested the company to ensure gas produced during the testing should be flared with appropriate flaring booms. The flare system should be designed as per good oil field practices and oil industry safety directorate guidelines. The company should ensure that there is no impact on flora and fauna due to drilling of wells in the offshore sea. It should undertake conservation measures to protect the marine animals/biota in the region. The company should monitor the petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals concentration in the marine fish species regularly and submit report to the government. Among others, the Panel suggested that all the hazardous waste generated at the rig/offshore facility should be properly treated, transported to on shore and disposed of in accordance with the norms. Reliance entered the exploration and production business by becoming a 30 per cent partner in an unincorporated joint venture with British Gas and RIL in the Panna Mukta and Mid and South Tapti blocks. Besides Panna Mukta and Tapti (PMT) blocks, their domestic portfolio comprises of five conventional oil and gas blocks in Krishna Godavari, Mahanadi, Cauvery Palar, Gujarat Saurashtra and Cambay Basin and two Coal Bed Methane (CBM) blocks in Sohagpur East and West in Madhya Pradesh. The company also has blocks in overseas.Disclosure: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is now part of the Reliance Group."

Also, its profit after tax (PAT) grew by 14% YoY and remained elevated like the last quarter at Rs7,320 crore. Apart from strong gross refining margin (GRM) of &amp;amp;#36;10.8 per barrel, the petro-chemical margin remained robust at 14% in the low absolute product prices environment. However, the profitability in exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) business was affected substantially with lower realisation and languishing volume. On the positive side, the retail business continued to sustain healthy growth and registered a 26% profit before interest and tax (PBIT) growth YoY. Consequently, RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s consolidated earnings grew by 13% YoY and was flat sequentially to Rs7,227 crore in Q4FY2016. Given the recent improvement in crude oil prices, the benchmark GRM is expected to cool off slightly in short term but RIL should continue to maintain a healthy premium over that. Further, large capital expenditure (capex) in downstream business is likely to yield positive result from the end of FY2017. Therefore, we expect RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s downstream business will continue to drive the earnings for the next two years, though oil &amp;amp;amp; gas business will remain subdued. Reliance Jio was launched for the group employees and other associates on a trial basis, which will be upgraded to commercial launch in a couple of months.

We hope to add a couple of hundreds more over and above the original number by the end of the current fiscal year.&amp;quot; The Mukesh Ambani-led company had reported its best set of numbers in eight years at Rs 7,398 crore in net income in the fourth quarter of 2015-16, up 16 percent over the year-ago period. Srikanth said the last year saw the best demand scenario in over 15 years and the company has sold over 3 million kilolitres of fuel in the domestic market. It can be noted that fossil fuel demand grew 11 percent in 2015-16, the best since 2000-01. Fuel use rose to 183.5 MT from 165.5 MT in the previous period. Diesel intake rose 7.5 percent to 74.6 MT, while gasoline/petrol usage rose 14.5 percent to 21.8 MT. The International Energy Agency (IEA) sees the country accounting for a quarter of global oil demand growth by 2040. It expects oil demand to touch 10 million barrels a day over the next 25 years, the fastest growth in the world. Indian Oil, which controls over 50 percent of fuel sales, expects petrol sales this fiscal to climb 11 percent and diesel by about 3 percent."

RIL, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat, is looking at quickly ramping up purchases to the earlier levels of about 5 million tonne a year. &amp;quot;Re-established relationship with Iran, sourced crude oil post lifting of sanctions,&amp;quot; the company said in an investor presentation after reporting 2015-2016 earnings. Bowing to international pressure to isolate Iran over its nuclear programme, RIL in January 2009 had stopped exporting gasoline or petrol to Iran. And from February 2010, it stopped buying crude oil from the West Asian nation. RIL, which has substantial investments in US shale gas projects, besides being a big supplier of fuel, shelved its business with Iran over fears of being sanctioned. With sanctions on Iran ending in January this year, RIL has re-established its ties with the country. Its joint CFO V Srikanth, in a press briefing in Mumbai on Friday, said the company is engaged in talks with Iran for bigger supplies, including a term or annual fixed quantity contract. &amp;quot;We have had engagements with Iran before the sanctions and they have grades of crude that are attractive to us,&amp;quot; he added. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL)andEssar Oil Ltd are the main buyers of Iranian oil in India, importing between them about 10 million tonnes a year. Besides, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) is looking at doubling imports from Iran to 4 million tonnes this year.Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) too may pick up small quantities this year. Soon after, Iran reached a deal with western nations on curbing its nuclear programme in exchange of lifting of sanctions in July last year, a top RIL official had stated that RIL would look again at starting petrol and diesel exports to the Persian Gulf nation. Nearly 63 percent of the oil products from RIL's refining complex at Jamnagar, with a total capacity of 62 million tonnes, are currently exported. RIL ships petrol to the Middle East, the US, South-East Asia and Australia while diesel is exported to Europe, Africa, South East Asia, the investor presentation said. &amp;quot;Successfully placed product into key markets of Turkey, East Africa and Australia,&amp;quot; it said. Domestically, it has operationalised 950 out of the 1,400 petrol pumps it has. &amp;quot;Achieved highest retail outlet throughout of about 240 kilolitres per month in March 2016 compared to all key competitors,&amp;quot; the presentation said."

UK's Vodafone Group, Telekom Malaysia from Malaysia, Omantel of Oman, UAE's Etisalat, Reliance Jio Infocomm and Dialog Axiata from Sri Lanka in a consortium built the BBG submarine cable system to link Malaysia and Singapore to the Middle East, with connections reaching out to India (Mumbai and Chennai) and Sri Lanka. Two branches of the ultra high speed communications system would connect with India at Chennai on the East Coast and Mumbai on the West Coast. Reliance Jio, the telecom arm of Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries, owns and operates the strategically important undersea cable landing facility in Chennai, providing a high-speed, high-capacity, low latency route connecting India to the rest of the world. The Mumbai landing of the BBG Submarine Cable System has been handled by Vodafone South. &amp;quot;We are excited about the launch of BBG as it offers not just direct connectivity in and out of India through Chennai and Mumbai but also acts as a state-of-the-art 100 Gbps extension of Jio's 100 Gbps core network,&amp;quot; said Mathew Oommen, President Reliance Jio. This brings key international content hubs closer to customers, delivering a much richer experience as an important part of driving India's broadband adoption, enabling consumers to shift away from the current high-cost low value propositions, he said. Providing robust, reliable, low latency connectivity, BBG strengthens one of the fastest growing global internet routes. BBG has deployed the latest submarine cable 100Gbps transmission technology, utilizing wavelength add/drop branching units along the route, with an initial equipped capacity of 9 terabits per second. From its terminating points in Barka, Oman to Penang, Malaysia, the cable measures a whopping 5,934 km in length. Four other branches split off from the main line - a 216 km branch to Fujairah, in the UAE, a 426 km branch to Mumbai, a 142 km branch to Colombo, Sri Lanka, and a 1,322 km branch to Chennai."

The move will help save the company Rs 3,000-4,000 crore needed to build offshore infrastructure to produce gas from the Daman gas field as well as C-26 Cluster projects, ONGC Director (Offshore) Tapas Kumar Sengupta told PTI here. &amp;quot;We plan to start producing gas from Daman using the abandoned Tapti facilities by August/September at the rate of 2 million standard cubic meters per day,&amp;quot; he said. Peak output of 8.35 mmscmd of gas and 9,286 barrels of condensate per day is likely by 2018-19, he said. C-26 Cluster will contribute another 3 mmcmd and about 2,000 barrels of condensate per day. With Mid &amp;amp;amp; South Tapti field output declining rapidly, partners in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields - RIL, BG and ONGC, decided to abandon the field last year. &amp;quot;Tapti at its peak produced 12 mmscmd of gas but the output dwindled to 0.1 mmscmd and partners decided to abandon it and return the field to the government. Government on its part handed over certain facilities of the field to ONGC to achieve early production from Daman,&amp;quot; he said. Abandonment means dismantling and removing infrastructure set up for production of oil and gas. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plans to use the Tapti field assets, which include sub-sea pipelines and gas gathering stations as well as process platform, to advance production of gas from its neighbouring Daman field. The assets include Tapti gas processing platform, which received gas from sub-sea wells, removes water and other impurities before transmitting it to onshore. ONGC will lay a small length of pipeline from the Daman field to the process platform, which is connected by a 70-km pipeline to its facility at Hazira. The official said the company is investing Rs 5,219 crore in bringing to production the Daman gas fields and another Rs 3,400 crore in C-26 Cluster. ONGC holds 40 per cent interest in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields while RIL and BP have 30 per cent each. The joint venture will continue to operate the Panna- Mukta field, which primarily is an oil bearing field located 90-km north-west of Mumbai in the Arabian Sea. It currently produces 19,000 barrels per day of oil and 5-6 mmscmd of gas. The JV members signed the Tapti Asset Transfer Agreement yesterday with ONGC, Sengupta said. This is first of its kind asset transfer agreement in India, demonstrating that facilities no longer required by an operator can be optimally used by another to expedite the field development activities and also to reduce capex burden. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

While Airtel offers 4G services in 15 circles, Idea has started 4G services in 575 towns across its 10 circles and intends to extend it to 750 towns by the first half of 2016. Having started its 4G services in five circles in February, Vodafone is promoting itself as 'World largest 4G network'. &amp;quot;We believe the delay in RJio launch has helped the market leaders to strengthen their 4G offerings,&amp;quot; UBS said. &amp;quot;We believe the market may be overly concerned over Reliance Jio's disruptive impact and ignoring rapid data growth in Indian mobile market which has led to significant operating leverage,&amp;quot; it said. Over the past 12 quarters Airtel and Idea data revenues are up 4-5 times and EBITDA margins up 800 basis points and 7000 bp respectively. &amp;quot;We believe that Indian data market is likely to grow 9 times (to USD 38 billion) by 2026 and Airtel and Idea are well positioned to benefit from this trend given accelerated 3G+4G rollout and Strong spectrum footprint,&amp;quot; UBS said. Post Videocon deal, Airtel has 4G coverage in 19 circles (88 percent of revenue base); Idea has 3G+4G spectrum in its 8 leadership circles. &amp;quot;We are also positive on Bharti Infratel as it offers a low beta play on data growth,&amp;quot; the note added."

Ambani also said Jio would target to expand the high-speed internet coverage in the country to over 90 percent by 2017, but remained silent on the exact commercial launch date of the much-awaited service. Speaking here at the inaugural session of Ficci Frames 2016, Reliance Industries Chairman said the opportunity to transform lives of 1.3 billion people motivated him to re-enter telecom sector and he believes Jio will drive the country's ranking in mobile Internet access to among top 10 from 150 currently. &amp;quot;As the world goes digital, we cannot afford to be left behind. Today, we are ranked 150 in the mobile Internet access rankings among 230 countries... 1.3 billion people cannot be left behind as the world enters a new era,&amp;quot; Ambani said.

The company was planning to commercially launch high-speed 4G network with focus on data services by last December, but later delayed the official launch. The company has not offered an official reason for the delay or the next possible date. Domestic media and entertainment industry has grown from USD 2 billion in 2004 to USD 18 billion in 2015, and it will be USD 100 billion in the next decade, Ambani said. &amp;quot;To my mind, digitisation is the defining trend of this century...If you don't have a globally competitive digital tool you will simply not survive, you will be disrupted, outcompeted, left behind and become irrelevant,&amp;quot; he said. On how Jio will aid the digital transformation, Ambani said the telecom offering will start services with 70 per cent coverage of the population from day 1, and the services will be very affordable. &amp;quot;With the efforts that Jio and all partners are making, high-speed internet coverage will be over 90 percent by 2017,&amp;quot; he said. Ambani promised quality offering, wherein Jio will offer speeds that are 40-80 times faster than the current Internet speed today.He also said Jio's network is engineered to provide a&amp;amp;nbsp;capacity of over 10 gigabytes of data per person, which is 100&amp;amp;nbsp;times the current data consumption average of 0.15 gigabytes a&amp;amp;nbsp;user per annum.&amp;quot;All of this is of no use if we cannot make it accessible&amp;amp;nbsp;and affordable to all and across the country,&amp;quot; Ambani said.&amp;amp;nbsp;Outlining five mega trends that define digital future, he&amp;amp;nbsp;said the world is moving from oral to visual medium and that&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;video will be the new voice of the network industry, driving&amp;amp;nbsp;learning, communication and entertainment&amp;quot;.Second, Ambani said opportunities will be larger in a&amp;amp;nbsp;digital ecosystem, as technology is exponential compared to&amp;amp;nbsp;human thinking which is linear.Third, telecom, ICT, and various media sectors are&amp;amp;nbsp;converging and the traffic is no longer linear, and have to be&amp;amp;nbsp;managed and regulated accordingly.He also said intelligent analytics is the key, as there is&amp;amp;nbsp;going to be an abundance of choice, distribution and content.&amp;quot;There will, however, be a scarcity of context, and&amp;amp;nbsp;purpose, and those who can address this will win,&amp;quot; he said.He also pointed out that technology cannot become the&amp;amp;nbsp;end-goal and it is only a means to make human life better.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18, which publishes moneycontrol.com"

Reliance is planning to lift the spot cargo in the first week of March, although there could be some delays, the source added.A Reliance spokesman said by email that the company does not comment on transactions as a matter of policy. NIOC's director general for international affairs, Mohsen Qamsari, did not immediately respond to emailed questions about the talks.Last month, Reliance's Chief Financial Officer V. Srikanth had said his company was evaluating buying crude from Iran after the lifting of international sanctions.Iranian oil, mainly heavy, sour grades such as Norouz and Soroush, accounted for about 8 percent of Reliance's overall imports in 2009. Analysts, however, said it could be difficult for Iran to resume supplying those grades, which Reliance would be seeking to achieve higher refining margins.It looks like most of Iran's output - except for the light oil grades known as condensate, judging from how much is held in storage - has already been full committed, said Ehsan Ul-Haq, senior analyst at London-based consultancy KBC Energy Economics.Some Indian refiners have recently expressed interested in buying Iran's West Karun grade, a blend of oil from four to five reservoirs, NIOC's Qamsari told Reuters last month, although it was not clear if Reliance was among them.Reliance may also restart refined fuel shipments to Iran that were stopped in 2007.&amp;quot;Iran still needs gasoline and Reliance is in a good position to supply that,&amp;quot; Haq said. &amp;quot;Iran will be more than willing to get gasoline from Reliance as its own refineries can not produce enough to meet demand,&amp;quot; he said.Reliance's sophisticated complex at Jamnagar in western Gujarat state can refine 1.24 million bpd of crude as varied as light West African to heavy sour Middle East and Latin American grades, allowing it to switch to whatever crude is cheapest.Disclosure: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is now part of the Reliance Group."

IOC has been looking at west coast for a refinery as catering to customers in West and South was difficult with its refineries mostly in the North. HPCL and BPCL have also been looking at a bigger refinery because of constraints they face at their Mumbai units. &amp;quot;The refinery will produce petrol, diesel, LPG, ATF and feedstock for petrochemical plants in plastic, chemical and textile industries in Maharashtra,&amp;quot; said Pradhan, who discussed the setting up of the refinery with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai yesterday. &amp;quot;Govt of Maharashtra and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas will closely work for early identification of land for refinery and finalisation of details of project,&amp;quot; he added. Fifteen million tonnes a year is the biggest refinery any public sector unit has set up in one stage. IOC recently started its 15 million tonnes unit at Paradip in Odisha. Reliance Industries holds the distinction of building the biggest refinery in India till now. It built its first refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 27 million tonnes, which was subsequently expanded to 33 million tonnes. It has built another unit adjacent to it for exports, with a capacity of 29 million tonnes. The refinery being planned by the state-owned firms will be bigger than that. The phase-1 itself will be bigger than any one single unit. It will cost Rs 2,500 crore per million tonnes and for the full 60 million tonnes it will cost Rs 1.5 lakh crore. It will also be accompanied by a petrochemical complex. Being on the west coast will provide the unit a natural advantage of easily sourcing crude oil from the Middle-East and Africa, officials said. Also, moving products to consumption heartland will not be difficult. IOC has six refineries with a total capacity of 54.20 million tonnes. It also has subsidiary refineries with 11.50 million tonnes capacity. Paradip has taken its refining capacity to 80.7 million tonnes."

As highlighted in our thematic report Shale we refine East!, dated July 17, 2015, a paradigm shift is playing out in regional refining competitiveness amid reversing WTI‐Brent spreads. This is structurally enhancing RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s GRM to levels last seen prior to the US shale revolution. Refining throughputs (116% utilisation) also expanded to historic highs (18MMT). Petrochemical EBIT rose 4% QoQ, bucking the trend of weaker benchmark polyester margins, as volumes rose 3% and margins expanded 170bps QoQ. The company has achieved industry leading throughput per outlet (TPO) of nearly 200kl/month from its 750 fuel retail outlets, while shale continued to face headwinds.

We have lowered our Brent forecast for FY16/17/18 to USD50/52/60 per barrel from USD53/60/65 on slower‐than‐anticipated cuts in US shale output and an expected production increase from Iran. We forecast earnings to double in 5 years as bulk of the USD32bn capex commissions over the next 2 years in addition to a structural upswing in GRMs. Despite a 23% outperformance vs. NIFTY in 2015, the stock still trades at attractive valuations (1.1x FY17E PBR).

Sudeep Anand of IDBI Capital Markets said the RIL's Q3 net profit of Rs 7,290 crore were ahead of his expectation of Rs 6,980 crore. Excerpts from the interview on CNBC-TV18.Latha: Is this inline or is it above your expectations?Joshi: Refining bang inline with what we were predicting. Petchem definitely surprised us both in terms of the absolute numbers and margins coming in at 14.4 percent.The important and pertinent point that I would like to raise is that expectations are always high and again I think that 11.5 number has come through, the market expectations were at 12 percent. I think it is good for the stock in a way that it normalized the expectations going forward as well because you cannot expect Reliance to keep on beating this number quarter after quarter. However having said that once these planned capacity expansions and the core capex that they have probably done specifically in terms of the petcoke gasification plant which will aid the refining margins going forward as well, I think that is going to be a big kicker for Reliance from FY17 onwards. Similarly on the petchem side, once you are looking at the off-gas cracker coming through and you are probably looking at the Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) plants coming through, you are probably going to see some amount of respite, even if you see the polymer and the polyester spreads probably getting determined by the supply demand dynamics in China. So, clearly it has out beaten expectations in terms of petchem performance, refining probably has been inline with expectations and probably is one of the best performance that Reliance has put up today. So, operationally the tax rates have been normalised, you are probably looking at no contribution incrementally happening from other income as well. So, it is an operational beat that has come in through. The throughput numbers that Anuj mentioned I think exceptionally good. So, over the past few quarters you have actually seen Reliance actually generate at around 110 percent in terms of throughput.Anuj: The stock has priced a lot of this in. Tomorrow morning what do you see on the stock? Do you see another rally, may be another 3-4 percent or do you think most of the good news is now in the price?Joshi: The expectations were running high. So, you might see some disappointment probably coming through. However you always have to see the large picture with Reliance and as I was mentioning earlier as well, they are almost at the end of their capex programme. What this effectively means is that the cash flows will now start improving because no capex is probably expected to come through incrementally at least on the core businesses, that is petchem or refining. Once those capacities start getting commissioned from the first half of FY16, FY17 numbers will be exceptionally good and consider that base over FY16.So, even if you see some amount of downside on to the stock, our own take is that the cash flows would improve, the RoEs which have probably got depressed because of the non-core capex specifically on the telecom part of almost Rs 1 trillion, I think even that will start contributing in a year, year and a half's timeframe. So, a lot of more positives are probably into the stock in terms of operational capabilities coming through. So, I will not be perturbed if the stock does correct tomorrow. In my opinion it might start lower. Clearly it becomes a very good buying opportunity for long term investors but this is not a stock that has to be seen on a quarter on quarter basis. If you look at FY17 numbers and if you predict those numbers I think they will be far better in our estimates compared to what FY15 and FY16 have given.Latha: Your first thoughts after looking at both the GRM margins and the EBIT?Anand: Results are definitely above our expectations mainly in led by petrochemicals segment. Though the refinery segment, GRM is in line with our expectation of USD 11.5 per barrel. However, EBIT of refinery segment is above our expectation of USD 61.3 billion.On petrochemicals segment we were expecting a margin of 12.7 percent while they have deported a very robust 14.4 percent, so that is clearly a beat. Overall our expectation for Rs 6,980 crore which they have surpassed significantly so result is definitely ahead of your expectation.Anuj: The stock has priced a lot of this in. Tomorrow morning what do you see on the stock? Do you see another rally, may be another 3-4 percent or do you think most of the good news is now in the price?Joshi: The expectations were running high.

HPCL has also been looking at a bigger refinery because of constraints it faces at the Mumbai unit,&amp;quot; he said.  So now, IOC, Hindustan Petroleum&amp;amp;nbsp;Corp Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;and Bharat Petroleum&amp;amp;nbsp;Corp Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;will jointly set up a &amp;quot;very large refinery&amp;quot; at a suitable location on the west coast, he said. &amp;quot;The concept has gone beyond thinking stage and is now under conception,&amp;quot; he said. Asked about the size of the refinery, he said, &amp;quot;It will be way bigger than 15 million tonnes.&amp;quot; Fifteen million tonnes a year is the biggest refinery any public sector unit has set up in one stage.  IOC recently started its 15 million tonnes unit at Paradip in Odisha. Reliance Industries holds the distinction of building the biggest refinery in India till now. It built its first refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 27 million tonnes, which was subsequently expanded to 33 million tonnes.  It has built another unit adjacent to it for exports, with a capacity of 29 million tonnes. The refinery being planned by the state-owned firms will be &amp;quot;bigger than that,&amp;quot; he said, adding that the refinery will cost Rs 2,500 crore per million tonnes. &amp;quot;The size, investment and configuration are all under works,&amp;quot; he said.  The refinery will also be accompanied by a petrochemical complex. Being on the west coast will provide the unit a natural advantage of easily sourcing crude oil from the Middle East and Africa, he said. Also, moving products to consumption heartland will not be difficult.  IOC has six refineries with a total capacity of 54.20 million tonnes. It also has subsidiary refineries with 11.50 million tonnes capacity. The 15 million tonnes refinery at Paradip will achieve &amp;quot;continuous production by month end,&amp;quot; he said.  This will take IOC's refining capacity to 80.7 million tonnes."

The falling crude oil prices have turned out to be a boon for the refiners with low feedstock, which is reflecting in strong benchmark gross refining margin (GRM). During Q3FY2016, the Singapore GRM improved sequentially to &amp;amp;#36;8 per barrel in Q3FY2016 and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is poised to record a hefty premium over the same. We expect RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s GRM to cross &amp;amp;#36;11 per barrel in this quarter and remain substantially higher (YoY) for FY2016. Going forward, commissioning of petcoke gasification project is likely to be accretive to refinery margin. In the petrochemical segment, the lower cost of feedstock (crude oil derivatives) and relatively stable product realisations have resulted in an improvement in margins. We have revised our earnings estimate to factor in lower crude oil prices and better margin for RIL. We have revised down our revenue estimate by around 15% to factor in lower crude oil prices. However, we have revised upward our earnings estimate by around 7-8% due to the prominent refining margin improvement trend. As the earnings are likely to witness strong growth, we have revised upward our price target to Rs 1,200 (earlier Rs 1,100) based on sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation and reiterate Buy rating on the stock.

Though, to be fair, consolidation in the telecom space began hotting up soon after the government approved spectrum sharing between telecom companies in September this year. However, if the deal does go through, it will help Vodafone double its geographical 4G presence from the five circles it currently has. The Economic Times reports Tikona had bought 2300 MHz (4G) spectrum in the 2010 auctions in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, UP (East), UP (West) and Rajasthan for over Rs 1,058 crore. Vodafone on the other hand does not have 4G airwaves in that band. It will be deploying its high-speed broadband services over the 1800 MHz band across five circles of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Karnataka and Kerala. India's second-largest telecom service provider has launched 4G services across 10 towns in Kerala only. Among the major telecom companies in India, only Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have airwaves in the 2300 MHz band. Meanwhile, in a bid to further consolidate its 4G footprint, Bharti Airtel too has acquired 74 percent stake in Augere Wireless Broadband India. Augere, owned by France Telecom and private equity funds such as Harbinger Capital and New Silk Route, had won 20 MHz of 4G spectrum in the 2300 MHz band in the Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh circle in the 2010 auction. Airtel has already launched 4G services across 350 towns and cities in India. Currently, Bharti Airtel has 4G spectrum in 15 circles (combination of 1800 and 2300 MHz band). Idea Cellular too has launched 4G services across South India on 1800 MHz band. The company hopes to cover all towns and cities in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana by March 2016. The company too is on a buying spree and recently acquired Videocon Telecom's spectrum in Uttar Pradesh (West) and Gujarat circles. In an earlier interview with CNBC-TV18, the company's managing director Himanshu Kapania had said that this acquisition will take Idea's 4G footprint from 10 to 12 circles. One of the reasons behind the consolidation wave&amp;amp;nbsp;may be because Reliance owns the second-largest amount of spectrum after Bharti Airtel. It has also set up a 2.5 lakh kilometre optic fibre network route connecting 18,000 towns across India already.However, former Airtel CEO Sanjay Kapoor cautions that while Reliance&amp;amp;nbsp;has got its first act right &amp;amp;mdash; putting a lot of effort into getting its network right, the challenge for telecom players across the globe is getting a glitch-free network, which&amp;amp;nbsp;is a trial and error process and it could take at least two years to perfect it."

When contacted, RIL spokesperson declined to comment.",,"Business, Jio, MF, Mukesh Ambani, petrochemical business, Reliance Industries, Sarvana Kumar",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ril-withdrawing-moneymfs-to-fund-capex-plans_4512941.html,"Reliance Industries, the largest investor in mutual funds worth around Rs 43,000 crore, is aggressively redeeming various funds of late to invest into its soon-to-be-launched telecom arm Jio, fuel expansion of its petrochemical business apart from paring debt. The move, which has seen the largest private sector company withdrawing close to Rs 15,000 crore in recent days, is also seen as a way to de-risk its investments as it expects interest rates to remain high, sources said. When contacted, RIL spokesperson declined to comment. For long, the Mukesh Ambani-led company has been the biggest treasury player and used to net around 40 percent of its total profit from such operations. However, for the past few quarters, it has been steadily lowering treasury play to around mid-20s and increasing its investments in MFs and other long-term investments. At the end of 2014-15, Reliance had Rs 43,005 crore in mutual fund debt schemes and other papers, up from a little over Rs 36,000 crore a year ago. Of this, Reliance has reportedly moved around Rs 15,000 crore in the past few days from duration schemes to liquid schemes of mutual funds. &amp;quot;RIL is investing large amount in various projects like telecom (around Rs 1 trillion) and petrochemicals. RIL's 4G telecom arm Jio was supposed to take off by the month-end, however, it has got delayed now. &amp;quot;Moreover, the company is looking for expanding its petrochemical business,&amp;quot; LIC Nomura Mutual Fund chief investment officer Sarvana Kumar told PTI. LIC Nomura, however, did not say whether it has seen any redemption by RIL nor did it say whether the company had invested in any of its funds. It can be noted that Reliance has undertaken a massive USD 32 billion capex a few years ago to set up infrastructure for its 4G telecom services, Reliance Jio, and to expand its oil refining and petrochemicals business. Already, the company has invested Rs 1 trillion in Jio. An analyst, who wished not to be named, said when RIL started all its multi-billion dollar expansion it had no debt on its book at a net level. &amp;quot;I think with these redemptions, company is creating liquidity with a view to make zero debt at the net level and become debt-free on a debt basis,&amp;quot; the analyst said. It can be noted that during the past AGM, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani had said that as investment cycles peak, the company would strive to become debt-free on a net level, which should start from next fiscal. Many funds believe domestic markets will face withdrawals by FPI if the US rates rise. &amp;quot;RIL is taking a call in view of the fact that the interest rate may harden post Fed rate hikes, which is likely to be around 25 bps when it reviews its monetary policy on December 16. &amp;quot;In their bid to protect capital appreciation, they are liquidating their duration investment and shifting towards liquid funds which are free from any interest rate risks,&amp;quot; he added. Duration investment schemes are medium-term mutual funds that offer good returns when interest rates are low, while liquid schemes are almost cash equivalent."

However, volatility sustained within the range of a few hundred points on the Nifty in the earnings season. The close fight in the Bihar assembly election and mixed global news flow are adding to the nervousness in the Indian equity market. During the last month, the Top Picks folio marginally lagged the benchmark indices with gains of 0.5% largely due to a correction in Lupin and Tata Consultancy Services after their weaker than expected results. On the other hand, the quarterly performance reported by Top Picks constituents like Reliance Industries, Maruti Suzuki and Zee Entertainment Enterprises was ahead of expectations. In this month the lone change in the Top Picks basket relates to churn within the pharmaceutical sector. We are replacing Lupin (which has more than doubled since we introduced it in the Top Picks basket at Rs 917 in January 2014 and has significantly outperformed the benchmark indices) with Dr Reddy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Laboratories. The change is more of a tactical call as Lupin&amp;amp;rsquo;s financial performance would remain weak for one or two more quarters whereas the near-term growth outlook for Dr Reddy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Laboratories is quite encouraging. Though we would add a caveat that Dr Reddy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Laboratories is facing issues (observations under Form 483; not serious in nature) with the US Food and Drug Administration at its bulk drug facility at Srikakulam but the same, we believe, should get resolved soon.Top Picks: Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Cadila Healthcare, Dr. Reddy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Lab, IndusInd Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Relaxo Footwear, Reliance Industries, SBI, TCS and Zee Entertainment.

But despite impressive growth rates, many firms are struggling with balance sheets stretched by costly spectrum auctions and rock bottom tariffs, making the telecoms sector in India prime for mergers and consolidations.In the first such move in seven years, Reliance Communications (RCom), owned by Ambani's younger brother and rival Anil, has agreed to buy Russian group Sistema's Indian mobile phone business.&amp;quot;One thing is clear: India has too many players and too much regulation in this space. Not everybody can make a profitable business out of it on a sustainable basis,&amp;quot; said a telecoms and technology M&amp;amp;amp;A banker with a leading U.S. bank.&amp;quot;The dealmaking conditions were ripe for many years, but the push is now coming from Reliance's entry into the sector,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;There will be a few more deals happening over the next couple of years, and some (players) will fall by the wayside.&amp;quot;The arrival of Reliance Industries into the sector, under the brand name Jio, will further squeeze players such as RCom and Bharti Airtel.Bankers expect smaller players to be pushed into the arms of larger rivals, bulking up to battle Reliance's Jio.Currently most carriers operate on wafer-thin margins, with 8 of the dozen carriers, including Aircel -- a unit of Malaysia's Maxis Communications Bhd -- and Tata Teleservices, holding a market share of less than 10 percent, according to sector regulator TRAI.Players including Aircel, which owns coveted 3G and 4G spectrum, could be a likely buyout target, analysts and bankers said, in a market overshadowed by large players including Bharti Airtel and the Indian unit of Vodafone. Aircel did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Tata Teleservices, the seventh-biggest mobile operator, is, according to sources, looking for a buyer for the stake Japan's NTT DoCoMo owns in the joint venture. DoCoMo decided to pull out last year, as the JV did not meet performance targets.RCom's Monday deal gave it access to more high-speed fourth-generation spectrum that Sistema owned, critical at a time when there is a huge demand for quality and fast data connection as more Indians access the Internet through their smartphones.Others will follow suit, bankers and analysts said.&amp;quot;The industry world over has three to five major players. India has to follow that,&amp;quot; said Hemant Joshi, a partner at consultancy Deloitte in India.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network18, which owns and&amp;amp;nbsp;publishes Moneycontrol.com)"

Commercial operation will most probably be in March 2016,&amp;quot; he said at the sidelines of Downstream Asia, an annual event held in Singapore. &amp;quot;We are running into a gasoline shortage and it is compounded by the fact that India will move into Euro V and Euro VI (gasoline specifications).&amp;quot; India, which has some of the world's most polluted cities, trails mature markets in the emission rules it follows. While the big cities follow what are known as Bharat Stage IV norms that are the equivalent of Euro IV controls, smaller cities follow Bharat Stage III. Europe currently follows stricter Euro VI norms. When the Paradip refinery hits full capacity, IOC would cut its gasoline imports but that would last a year or a year-and-a-half, after which it would have to rely on imports again as demand would outgrew its supplies, said George. India has surplus refining capacity, mainly because of Reliance Industries and Essar Oil, but IOC on its own is lacking in gasoline supplies for now and importing the fuel is more economical.

Net profit increased 8.0% Q-o-Q and 12.5% YoY; the rise is mainly on account of higher refining margins. GRMs stood higher at USD 10.6/ barrel compared to USD 10.4/ barrel in Q1FY16 and USD 8.3 in Q2FY15. GRMs was higher due to strong gasoline cracks (19.4 in Q2FY16 vs 19.8 in Q1FY16) product mix flexibility, robust risk management coupled with opportunistic crude sourcing and lower energy cost. Petchem EBIT increased by 8.3% on a Q-o-Q basis and 7.2% YoY, led by strong polymer deltas and healthy polyester chain deltas along with higher volumes. Retail business has been consolidated and posted an EBIT of INR 117 crs for the quarter up 5.4% QoQ and 18.2% YoY. Other income was lower primarily on account of lower accruals on investments. RIL's outstanding debt was higher at INR 172,765 crs as on Sep 30, 2015 when compared to INR 170,814 crs as on June 30, 2015. Cash in the books stood at INR 85,720 Vs INR 87,391 crs in Q1FY16. These were in bank deposits, mutual funds, CDs and Government Bonds and other marketable securities. Capex incurred for the quarter ended Sep 30, 2015 was INR 20,000 crs Vs INR 32,651 crs in Q1FY16 including exchange rate difference capitalization. Capital expenditure was principally on account of ongoing expansions projects in the petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar, Dahej and Hazira, Jio Infocomm and US Shale gas projects.Valuation: We believe over the medium to long term refining margins to remain range bound as capacity additions though it is delayed will eventually match the demand growth. RIL will further gain from efficient crude sourcing and product placement. We expect RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s GRMs to be between &amp;amp;#36;9.5-10.5/bbl in FY16 and FY17 (will go up by &amp;amp;#36;2.5/bbl post commissioning of petcoke regasification terminal).

The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) last month issued a notice to the declared 20 pipelines of IOC, accounting for close of half of the company's pipeline capacity of 80 million tons, as common carrier by reserving some portion of lines for use by third parties. The move would allow private firms like Essar Oil and Reliance Industries to get rights to move products on the 5,900-km network. The 20 pipelines have a combined capacity to move 38.59 million tons of products annually. Strongly opposing the move, IOC in its comments on the proposal said all of the 20 pipelines are for captive use. &amp;quot;IOC's pipelines are not being used for supply of petroleum and petroleum products to any consumer,&amp;quot; it said adding all of them are dedicated pipelines being used for captive purpose. The pipelines, it said, originate from IOC's refineries and terminate at the company's depots. &amp;quot;These pipelines merely serve as a mode of evacuation and of stock transfer.&amp;quot; IOC said petroleum product pipelines are not natural monopolies as alternative modes of transport (rail/road) are available. &amp;quot;It is not a case of natural gas pipelines where there is a natural monopoly as natural gas cannot be transported on land by any other modes. &amp;quot;Hence the basic criterion for bringing in competition for petroleum product pipelines is totally different, and as per that market dynamics, competition already exists in the market. Further IOC's pipelines since inception are intended and being used for captive purpose,&amp;quot; the company said. IOC said its pipelines are not 'common carrier' under provision of the PNGRB Act of 2006 and the regulator's authority in respect of those pipelines which are not covered within the definition of common carrier is limited. &amp;quot;IOC's pipelines are for captive use and as such dedicated pipelines under the 2006 Act. Without such dedicated pipeline, no refinery can be conceptualised and implemented on economic viability. &amp;quot;If the pipelines are not treated as dedicated pipeline, then the entire refinery industry will be hampered adversely, leading to non-fulfilment of public requirement,&amp;quot; it said. IOC argued that a pipeline can de declared a 'common carrier' only when there is more than one consumer. It says its pipelines cater exclusively to its own logistic requirements. Among the pipelines PNGRB had sought to be declared as common carrier include Barauni-Kanpur, Koyali-Ahmedabad, Mathura-Delhi, Panipat-Ambala-Jalandhar, Chennai-Bangalore, Haldia-Barauni and Guwahati-Siliguri."

Meanwhile, the tribunal also adjourned the hearing on Reliance Industries (RIL) appeal challenging Rs 13 crore penalty imposed by Sebi for alleged non-disclosure of a key earnings ratio by the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate.

This week, equity benchmarks saw biggest weekly loss in last four years. The Sensex shed 4.5 percent and Nifty dropped 4.3 percent.&amp;amp;nbsp; The BSE Sensex crashed more than 2 percent on Friday to end at lowest closing level since July 2014. Foreign institutional investors have sold Rs 1,287.12 crore worth of shares on Friday (as per provisional data on exchange), taking the total selling to nearly Rs 4,000 crore in September. On the other side, domestic institutional investors bought Rs 1,128.7 crore worth of shares, who have been consistent buyers since August 11. But fret not! According to IIFL, dramatic fall in Indian equities recently, triggered by global sell‐off, offers a significant buying opportunity for investors. The best part is that one needn&amp;amp;rsquo;t go hunting for small gems as many blue‐chips are trading at attractive long‐term valuations. &amp;amp;ldquo;Large caps offer reasonably high business visibility and their relative attractiveness has improved with midcap valuations catching up in last few months,&amp;amp;rdquo; it says in a note. The brokerage recommends 11 large cap stocks as high conviction buy ideas&amp;amp;nbsp; with a combined market capitalisation of Rs 1,371,739 crore or 14.3 percent of total equity market cap. The large caps may provide a margin of safety vis‐a‐vis midand small caps in situation when volatility is expected to be high for the rest of 2015 on account of global factors. Here are 11 largecap stocks to buy: State Bank of India Setting a target price of Rs 328, IIFL says SBI&amp;amp;rsquo;s domestic loan growth is set to improve from current 5 percent year-on-year to 15‐17 percent (Y-o-Y) in FY18 on the back of economic recovery and supported by a healthy capital position. It says even a modest 12‐13 percent loan CAGR over FY15‐17 should drive a strong 25‐26 percent annual earnings growth. Reliance IIFL has a target price of Rs 1150. The brokerage feels over the next three years core businesses will drive a strong 25 percent CAGR in standalone EBIDTA on the back of commencement of large projects‐off gas cracker and petcoke gasification. It expects recovery in gas prices over the longer term as demand remains strong for the cleaner fuel. IIFL thinks a re‐rating is due given strong earnings growth profile in the coming years. ICICI Bank While the credit conditions remain challenging, the bank expects lower quantum of stress assets addition in FY16 as compared FY15. Credit cost for the year is expected at 90‐95 basis points. IIFL estimates ICICI Bank to deliver healthy earnings CAGR of 18 percent and sustain RoA at robust 1.8‐1.9 percent over FY15‐17.It has a target price of Rs 380 per share. Coal India An increase in share of non‐power sales volume would lead to higher realisations for the company as sales to non-power consumer is done at 30‐35 percent premium to FSA rates. Coal India is expected to report an increase in its margins led by higher production, reducing man power headcount, increased outsourcing and lower oil prices. Downside from current levels would be supported by strong dividend yield, with a target of Rs 454 per share. Britannia With a target price of Rs 3956 per share, IIFL says the company has immense room for growth in the core biscuit segment. Apart from cost rationalisation, key trigger for margin expansion from hereon will be premiumisation, increased focus in international business and aggressive roll‐out in higher margin business like cakes, rusks, dairy &amp;amp;amp; snacks. Larsen and Toubro The company has guided for 15 percent order inflow growth on the prospect pipeline for balance FY16. Revenue growth likely to be strong over the next three years as IIFL expects execution to pick up in the domestic market from H2 FY16. Management has guided for margin expansion of 100 bps in FY16. IIFL has a price target of Rs 2161. Axis Bank Axis Bank may deliver healthy earnings CAGR of 18 percent over FY15‐17 in spite of a marginal softening of NIMs. The return on asset and and return on equity (RoE) may remain stable at 1.7 percent and 17‐18 percent respectively over the period. IIF says for significant re‐rating, the bank needs to deliver on its asset quality guidance. It has a target of Rs 650. Tata Motors IIFL thinks absolute volumes from China will only improve from levels reported in Q1 FY16. XE can drive volumes for Jaguar portfolio as Evoque did to Land Rover portfolio. LCV segment is also expected to pick up from H2 FY16. Fall of 30% in the past three months has more than factored in the weakness and IIFL expects an earnings CAGR of 18 percent. It has a revised target price of Rs 485. Aurobindo Pharma IIFL says the pharma company is clearly building a differentiated product portfolio with large sub segments within the complex generics space and focus on vaccines and inhalers. It forecasts 22 percent earnings per share (EPS) CAGR and margin ramp up of 270 bps over FY15‐17E. It has a target of Rs 960. IndusInd Bank The management expects asset quality to remain sanguine in FY16 and therefore credit cost would likely be lower than budgeted 55‐60bps. A strong asset growth and NIM expansion would drive 30 percent annual earnings growth over FY15‐17 for IndusInd Bank. Industry‐best RoAs of 1.9‐2 percent and robust profit growth calls for incremental valuation re‐rating of the stock, says IIFL. Target price is Rs 1111. Motherson Sumi IIFL believes valuations are sustainable given the strong earnings CAGR expectation of over 50 percent. It thinks there is high probability of the company meeting its 2020 targets considering its strong track record and good visibility provided by the customers. Target price is Rs 400 per share.

ONGC board earlier this month approved submission of the draft FDP for one set of oil and gas discoveries made in the eastern offshore Block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, which sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 area. &amp;quot;We are looking at producing 77,000 barrels per day of oil and 14 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the first set of discoveries by 2018-19,&amp;quot; a senior company official said.  The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km). ONGC has divided 12 oil and gas discoveries in KG-D5 and gas discovery in an adjacent G-4 block in the Bay of Bengal into three clusters to quickly bring them to production. Cluster-1 comprises D&amp;amp;amp;E discoveries as also G-4 find in the neighbouring area which ONGC estimates can produce 14.5 mmscmd of gas for 15 years.  Cluster-2A mainly comprises oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,000 barrels per day (3.75 million tonnes per annum). Cluster-2B, which is made up of four gas finds -- R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA, envisages a peak output of 14 mmscmd of gas with cumulative production of 32.5 bcm of gas in 14 years. The official said ONGC is presently focused on developing Cluster-2A and 2B and a draft FDP for these has been submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).  &amp;quot;There are some issues regarding conformity tests for discoveries in Cluster-1. So until they are sorted out, a FDP cannot be prepared for them,&amp;quot; he said. The draft FDP for Cluster-2A and 2B does not detail the investment that would be required to bring the discoveries to production, he said.  &amp;quot;There is some more technical work that needs to be done before we arrive at a number but the investment should be in the range of USD 6-7 billion,&amp;quot; he said, adding first gas production is planned by mid-2018 and first oil by mid-2019. If discoveries in Cluster-1 get approved, the total investment will climb to USD 8.843 billion, he said. Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA.  &amp;quot;UD-1 lies in water depth of 2,400-3,200 meters and there is no technology to produce from such depths. And so Cluster-3 is presently not being pursued for development,&amp;quot; he said. While gas from the block will be evacuated to Odalarevu onshore terminal in Andhra Pradesh through 20-inch, 35.5 km sub-sea pipeline, oil is proposed to be taken on to an FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) anchored in high-sea.  Oil from FPSO will then be transfered to tankers for transportation to refineries."

India has surplus refining capacity, but there has been maintenance at some plants and petrol demand has risen after a cut in diesel subsidies increased the attractiveness of petrol cars. Petrol imports from April to June were the highest in more than four years, official data showed. As a result, Asia's average petrol profit margin for refiners, or the crack, in the first seven months of 2015 was USD 12.60 a barrel, the highest for the period since 2009, based on Reuters data going back to the second half of 2008. &amp;quot;Petrol imports are there as we are seeing a robust growth in demand,&amp;quot; said B. Ashok, chairman of Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's biggest refiner, which undertook maintenance at its Koyali refinery from March to April. In the first six months of the year, India's petrol demand grew 14.17 percent, official data showed, and trade sources expect growth this year to reach 17 percent. Although India still exports more petrol than it buys, a government source said state refiners would continue importing at least until the end of this fiscal year to March 31 2016. Higher domestic demand meant that total petrol exports for January-June 2015 fell about 5.2 percent to 7.2 million tonnes or 337,400 barrels per day (bpd), while imports have spiked to about 23,400 bpd from about 2,850 bpd. For all of 2015, consultancy JBC Energy expects India's petrol surplus to fall to around 310,000 bpd and drop below 300,000 bpd in the next few years, versus 345,000 bpd in 2014. IOC, the key importer of petrol, has sought almost 700,000 tonnes for March-September delivery. State refiners also buy petrol and diesel from private firms Reliance Industries and Essar Oil, but since they charged more for coastal supplies an IOC source said his firm had switched to imports. Further tightening the market, has been a switch by some north Indian states to less polluting Euro IV petrol. IOC's Panipat refinery is only able to meet 75 percent of demand for Euro IV, the IOC source said. India's strong petrol demand comes as major consumers Japan and Australia shut refining capacity and switch instead to imports. Overall demand is also growing. ESAI Energy research agency expects global petrol consumption to grow by 50,000 bpd to 420,000 bpd this year."

The state-run firm booked Rs 118 crore more profit than the Mukesh Ambani-run firm net income of Rs 6,318 crore. Better refining margins arising from lower oil prices and almost full payback of subsidies by the government helped the nation's biggest oil company Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to report a massive more than two-fold jump in the June quarter net profit at Rs 6,436 crore. IOC's refining margins soared to a seven-year high during the reporting quarter. For Reliance, losing the numero uno slot comes within two quarter as in the December 2014 earnings season as well it had lost out to TCS as it booked more profit than RIL with a net income of Rs 5,328 crore. The loss in the December 2014 quarter was the end of RIL's 23-year run as the most profitable firm with a net profit in the country, overtaking the long-standing champion Reliance which saw its profit dip to Rs 5,256 crore as falling crude prices hurt its core business. The third most profitable company in the June quarter was Tata Consultancy Services with net income at Rs 5,684 crore for the June quarter, up 2 percent y-o-y, while its revenue rose 16.1 percent to Rs 25,668 crore. With this, IOC thus also becomes the first domestic company to sniff at the billion-dollar club in quarterly earnings based on the closing price of the rupee on the earnings day (65.10) while it was well in the club on the as the rupee had closed at 63.64 on June 30. During the reporting quarter the crude prices on an average fell 43.5 percent for both the companies. Even in the December 2014 quarter, IOC was very close to RIL with quarterly net profit of Rs 6,285 crore. The loss of RIL is more pronounced as only last fiscal year (FY15) the company had overtaken the state-run oil and gas giant ONGC to become the most profitable company in the country both on an annual basis with a annual net income of Rs 23,566 crore, against the public sector company's net profit of Rs 18,334 crore.(Disclosure: RIL owns Network18, which owns and published moneycontrol.com)"

Augur Overseas Operation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Augur Aeronautical Centre (AAC), a leading aerostat and airship designer, builder and supplier globally. Augur Aeronautical Centre has already tied up with Pipavav Defence, a company acquired by Reliance Group.  &amp;quot;This is part of strategic technical partnership to collaborate on new technologies both for the civil and military market as part of 'Make in India' policy,&amp;quot; a statement by the Reliance Group said. Under the agreement, the two companies will form a joint venture company, with Reliance controlling 51 per cent stake, consistent with the current Government regulations. The joint venture (JV) will be involved in development, production, sales, modification and life support for different sizes of aerostats, airships and lighter than air systems.  This JV will address the requirements of domestic market and also the regional and global markets. As part of the existing arrangement, the first medium size Aerostat envelope was delivered recently, the statement said. This was after successful acceptance tests were performed at Pipavav facilities.  The tests included integration and simulated mooring; verification of equipment and functioning of Aerostat envelope together with pressurisation system. In the present changing security scenario in the Indian context, there is a constant need of monitoring as the country has almost 14,000 km long international border, including a nearly 7,500 km coast line. Aerostat radars are a force multiplier as they are deployed extensively in the surveillance, reconnaissance and communication roles by the armed forces.  These are also useful in detecting low-flying fighter aircraft. As per the latest market research report, the aerostat market is projected to rise from Rs 25,000 crore in 2014 to Rs 65,000 crore by 2020, the statement said. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Accepting a government offer to conduct Drill Stem Test (DST) under limited cost to retain gas discoveries that otherwise would have been taken away for not meeting timelines, RIL has opted to do confirmatory test on two of the three contentious gas finds in the KG-D6 block and one of the two discoveries in question in NEC-25 block. RIL and its partners -- BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources -- will relinquish discoveries D-40 in NEC-25 block off the Odisha coast and D-31 in KG D6 block, sources privy to the development said. The company will conduct DST on discoveries D-32 in NEC-25 block and D-29 and D-30 in KG D6 block. Sources said the budget for doing the DST within the government prescribed cost of USD 15 million each was approved at block oversight panel, called Management Committee, meeting last week. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had in April approved a policy to allow operators to develop a dozen contentious natural gas discoveries worth about Rs 1 lakh crore at current prices. The new policy gives companies options to either develop the finds at their own risk or perform upstream regulator DGH-prescribed conformity tests before developing them and recoup the entire cost. Sources said the policy approved by CCEA settled long pending issue with regards to 12 discoveries in five blocks pertaining to&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) (six discoveries) and RIL (six discoveries). The 12 finds hold reserves of around 90 bcm of gas. The CCEA allowed companies to either relinquish the blocks or develop the discoveries after conducting DST with 50 percent cost of DST being disallowed as penalty for not conducting the test on time. The cost recovery for carrying out DST capped at USD 15 million. Alternatively, the companies were allowed to develop the discoveries without conducting DST in a ring-fenced manner i.e. at their own cost. The expenditure incurred in developing these finds will be recouped only if the fields are commercially producible. RIL had notified the Dhirubhai-29, 30 and 31 finds in 2007 and submitted a formal application for declaring them commercial in 2010, well within the timelines set in the Production Sharing Contract. But the Oil Ministry's technical arm DGH refused to recognise them in absence of prescribed confirmatory test. Same was the case with its gas discoveries in North-East Coast block NEC-0SN-97/1 (NEC-25) which hold recoverable reserves of 1.032 trillion cubic feet. For the very same reasons, DGH had not agreed for DoC of ONGC's D, E and UD-1 finds in KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block.

Barring a 6-month cracker delay, core projects are largely on track. Telecom launch in Dec-15 and its first ever detailed disclosure gave glimpse of Reliance Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s network, content creation/affordable handset efforts and likely pricing. While voice strategy remains uncertain, we believe 4G subscriber conversion would be key. Large non-core investments even if accretive over long-term; any gains will be back-ended, diluting overall return ratio in the interim. While Reliance JIO commercial launch is delayed to Dec-15 (vs expected phased launch in CY15), a combination of (a) significant expected decline in the 4G handset price to INR4,000 by Dec-15 (vs INR8,000-10,000 now) and (b) significant capacity/scale of JIO planned at launch date (~100m wireless subscribers) would lead to increased activity in the telecom data market. Reliance JIO&amp;amp;rsquo;s voice strategy remains uncertain as no particular details were shared about how it would be providing voice services which currently constitute ~80% of the Indian wireless market revenue. We expect potential tie-up with existing operators for circuit-switched-fall-back (CSFB). Large-scale population coverage planned by JIO combined with low 4G handset prices can enable mass adoption of 4G services. However, rate of subscriber up-take would be the key as JIO would be largely targeting churn from existing subscribers with the proposition of a cheaper and better data offering. &amp;quot;A six month delay in cracker and low shale gas returns could be offset by better GRM&amp;amp;rsquo;s in FY17. On FY17E basis (standalone), the stock trades at 9x adj. EPS of INR104 and EV/EBITDA of 6.8x. SOTP-based target price stands at INR965/sh. Neutral&amp;quot;, says Motilal Oswal research report.

A government official said there had been no change in the ban and that Cairn India might simply be trying to establish a price for its oil via the tender process ahead of negotiations to sell it to local buyers. Cairn India, backed by billionaire Anil Agarwal, did not respond to telephone calls and an email seeking comment about the export notice. India is the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer and imports about 80 percent of its oil needs, leading it to place restrictions on the export of locally-produced oil. Despite this, Cairn India has sought expressions of interest from &amp;quot;reputed prospective international buyers&amp;quot; for the export of about three to five cargoes of 600,000 barrels each in the quarter starting October, according to the copy of the notice. &amp;quot;They may be looking at discovering price for their oil because the previous pricing formula was valid till March 31 and also now oil prices have declined,&amp;quot; said the government official, who declined to be named. Cairn India has been selling oil to Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;, Essar Oil&amp;amp;nbsp;and Indian Oil Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;for the past five years on the basis of a negotiated formula that allows a discount of about 10-15 percent to Brent rates . Demand for Cairn India's oil in the current fiscal year is likely to be higher than a year ago. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd's managing director H. Kumar said recently his firm could buy 8,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Rajasthan crude this fiscal year, while Indian Oil Corp plans to raise purchases buy a third to 40,000 bpd. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, a joint venture of state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp and steel tycoon Lakshmi N. Mittal, has told the government it could also process some Rajasthan crude, the government source said. Cairn India is the operator of the Rajasthan block with a 70 percent stake, while the remainder is held by state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;."

We will get a firm fix on the numbers once studies are completed. &amp;quot;IOC owns and operates eight refineries and has only a few weeks back added ninth refinery at Paradip in Odisha. Its eight refineries have a cumulative refining capacity of 54.2 MT of crude oil and addition of 15 MT at Paradip refinery has helped it regain the top refiner slot in the country. It overtook Reliance Industries, which has twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 62 MT. Essar Oil&amp;amp;nbsp;is the only other private refiner having a 20 MT a year unit at Vadinar in Gujarat. The official said IOC is also looking at raising capacity of its 13.7 MT a year Koyali refinery in Gujarat by 4.3 MT as well as hiking capacity of Mathura refinery in Uttar Pradesh by three MT to 11 MT. A small capacity addition of 0.5 MT is also planned at 7.5 MT Haldia refinery in West Bengal.Panipat Refinery was commissioned in 1998 with a capacity of six MT per annum. The refining capacity was doubled to 12 MT in 2006 and then raised by a further three MT to 15 MT in2010. The new expansion planned will cater to fuel needs of north and western India. &amp;quot;We are working on raising fuel quality specifications to meet Euro-IV and V standards at our refineries and so the Panipat expansion too is being reconfigured to meet the new specifications,&amp;quot; he said. Panipat refinery processes a wide range of both indigenous and imported grades of crude oil. It receives crude from Vadinar through the 1370-km long Salaya-Mathura Pipeline which also supplies crude to Koyali and Mathura refineries of IOC. Petroleum products are transported through various modes like rail, road as well as pipelines. The refinery caters to the high-consumption demand centres in North-Western India including the States of Haryana, Punjab, J&amp;amp;amp;K, Himachal, Chandigarh, Uttaranchal, as well as parts of Rajasthan and Delhi."

RIL, through its subsidiary Reliance Holding USA Inc had acquired 49.9 percent stake in EFS Midstream LLC in June 2010. The Midstream system consists of 10 gathering plants and about 460 miles of pipelines. The system gathers and separates produced condensate from produced gas. It also stabilises the condensate, where necessary, and treats the gas produced from the Eagle Ford upstream joint venture operated by Pioneer with 46 percent. RIL holds 45 percent interest in the Eagle Ford upstream joint venture and the rest 9 percent is with Newpek LLC. It is being speculated that RIL may be looking at selling this stake as well. RIL, which bought 45 percent interest in Pioneer Natural Resources Co's Eagle Ford shale formation of south Texas for USD 1.3 billion, is working with Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to find a buyer. The Eagle Ford assets, spread over 230,000 acres, have become more attractive after the US Commerce Department, in June last year, gave Pioneer permission to export a type of ultralight oil known as condensate produced from the region. Besides Eagle Ford, RIL has two more shale ventures in the US - 40 percent stake in Chevron's Marcellus shale acreage and a 60 percent interest in Carrizo Oil and Gas Inc's Marcellus shale acreage in Central and Northeast Pennsylvania. &amp;quot;Enterprise Products Partners LP on Monday announced it has executed definitive agreements to purchase all of the member interests in EFS Midstream LLC from affiliates of Pioneer Natural Resources Company and Reliance Industries Limited for USD 2.15 billion,&amp;quot; the statement by the New York listed firm said. Under the terms of the agreements, the Pioneer and Reliance to use the EFS Midstream for moving condensate and gas for 20 year on fee-based arrangement."

The just completed Ranbaxy deal, its biggest to date at USD 3.2 billion, has given India's biggest drugmaker sufficient scale in generics and emerging markets to think about its next step - beefing up expertise in higher margin products and gaining a bigger global presence. On Sun Pharma's radar are US and European companies that develop biosimilars - cheaper copies of biotech drugs which have become some of world's hottest selling medicines, investment bankers say. &amp;quot;What has changed after the Ranbaxy acquisition is that their ambition has grown and now they want to become a global company which is more innovation-oriented,&amp;quot; said a banker at a foreign bank with knowledge of Sun Pharma's plans. Dilip Shanghvi, who with his family controls Sun Pharma and is India's second richest man according to Forbes magazine, feels the need for a &amp;quot;transformational acquisition&amp;quot;, but will be patient about finding the right candidate, he added. Sun Pharma, which has a market value of nearly USD 36 billion, is also interested in non-biotech complex generic medicines that offer better margins than the simpler copycat drugs Indian drugmakers usually specialise in. It is willing to look at either whole companies or acquire complex generics on their own, the bankers said, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media on the matter. In one potential near-term opportunity, they said Sun Pharma may emerge as a bidder for some drugs Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , the world's biggest generic drugmaker, will likely be required to divest if it is successful in its unsolicited &amp;amp;#36;40 billion bid for rival Mylan . A Sun Pharma spokesman declined to comment for this article. Shanghvi said last month the Ranbaxy deal did not preclude Sun Pharma from further M&amp;amp;amp;A, especially if the target company has capable management. But he also said Sun Pharma will focus for the time being on resolving quality problems at Ranbaxy factories. NEW M&amp;amp;amp;A CHIEF With a cash balance of USD 1.5 billion and a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.13, Sun Pharma would find it easy to take on debt to fund any large acquisition, the bankers said. &amp;quot;The company is also generating lot of cash every year and if they don't use it to fuel growth, it will erode shareholder value,&amp;quot; said an India M&amp;amp;amp;A head at a European bank. Sun Pharma, already the most acquisitive of India's drugmakers, this month hired Arvind Kumar, a former M&amp;amp;amp;A executive at Reliance Industries Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;and JSW Steel Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;, to head its acquisitions team, sources said. Kumar's LinkedIn profile confirms the appointment, although a Sun Pharma spokesman declined to comment. In recent years, Sun Pharma has weighed bids for eye products-maker Bausch &amp;amp;amp; Lomb Holdings Inc, which was later sold for USD 8.7 billion, Swedish drug firm Meda AB as well as German generic maker Stada Arzneimittel AG , sources have said. But now, Sun Pharma is most likely to gun for a biosimilar deal, bankers and analysts say, as biotech medicines currently account for six of the 10 biggest-selling drugs in the world and as it lags domestic rivals Biocon Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;and Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;in the field. The global biotech market, currently worth over USD 100 billion annually, will reach USD 200 billion in 2016-2017, according to forecasts by IMS Health. Previous Sun Pharma deals include the USD 230 million purchase of US-based dermatology specialist Dusa Pharmaceuticals in 2012 and USD 450 million acquisition of a majority stake in Israel's Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd."

With Tapti output declining rapidly, partners in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields - RIL, BG and ONGC, have decided to abandon the field. &amp;quot;Tapti abandonment (has) achieved resolution with Government of India,&amp;quot; RIL said a presentation to analysts after the company's fourth-quarter results.  Gas output from the field has almost halved to 14.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) in 2014-15 while oil production was 0.2 million barrels, down 22 per cent from previous fiscal. RIL said: &amp;quot;ONGC will take over Tapti Part A facilities in accordance with Tapti Production Sharing Contract (PSC) along with abandonment obligation.&amp;quot; The other part will be abandoned. &amp;quot;Joint venture (will be) responsible for abandonment obligation for the Tapti Part B facilities,&amp;quot; it said.  Abandonment means dismantling and removing infrastructure set up for production of oil and gas. ONGC official said the company plans to use the Tapti field assets, which include sub-sea pipelines and gas gathering stations as well as process platform, to advance production of gas from its neighbouring Daman field. The assets include Tapti gas processing platform, which received gas from sub-sea wells, removes water and other impurities before transmitting it to onshore.  ONGC will lay a small length of pipeline from the Daman field to the process platform, which is connected by a 70-km pipeline to its facility at Hazira. The official said the company is investing Rs 5,219 crore in bringing to production the Daman gas fields. Production is expected by July 2016 at the rate of 2 million standard cubic meters per day and peak output of 8.35 mmscmd of gas and 9,286 barrels of condensate per day is likely by 2018-19, he said.  ONGC holds 40 per cent interest in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields while RIL and BP have 30 per cent each. The joint venture will continue to operate the Panna-Mukta field, which primarily is an oil bearing field located 90-km north-west of Mumbai in the Arabian Sea. It produced 7.2 million barrels of oil and 70.7 bcf of gas.  According to RIL, the oil production from Panna-Mukta was almost flat while gas registered 8 per cent increase. Primarily gas-bearing Tapti field is located 160 km north-west of Mumbai and is currently producing about one million standard cubic meters per day and even this output is expected to taper off to zero before the year end. The Panna-Mukta fields are expected to stay in production till fiscal 2019."

However, revenue is likely to be at Rs 65,000 crore during January-March quarter against Rs 80,196 crore in previous quarter. Gross refining margin (GRM) of the company is set to surge to a 2-year high of USD 9.9 a barrel against USD 7.3 a barrel in previous quarter. Some brokerages also said there was a possibility of Reliance reporting a GRM of USD 11 a barrel . Singapore GRM was USD 8.4 a barrel during March quarter against USD 6.3 a barrel in previous quarter. The improvement in GRM may be on account of improved crack spreads in key products and also due to the absence of significant inventory losses. Crack spreads were buoyed by a 30 percent reduction in crude prices and planned/unplanned refinery outages. During the quarter, refining throughput may have fallen due to planned shutdown but surge in GRMs could offset that fall. Petchem profitability may improve sequentially as Q3 was impacted by low realised spreads on deferred purchases by consumers.

Among the domestic factors, Lok Sabha elections 2014, in which BJP under the leadership of Mr Modi had got the decisive mandate removing the political uncertainty and brought hopes for good governance. Sharp drop in crude oil prices and stronger rupee had improved fiscal health and led to a turnaround in Indian macros. Globally, steady recovery in the US economy had led to the US Fed ended the QE and readying for increase in interest rates, confirming the healthy recovery in the worlds&amp;amp;rsquo; largest economy. Our Wealth Maximizer 2014 performed well with Nine out of ten stocks exceeding the targets. We retain six out of the ten stocks and replaced four stocks due to expected under-performance in the next few quarters. Outlook for 2015Economic growth to reach 6.5%-7.0% during 2015 driven by good governance under the leadership of Mr. Modi: During the year 2015, Indian economic growth could be driven by reform momentum. The government has taken the initiatives to introduce GST, land acquisition amendments, insurance sector reforms and coal blocks auction bills. Under the &amp;amp;lsquo;Make in India&amp;amp;rsquo; campaign, Govt is opening opportunities for domestic manufacturing in Defence, Electronics Hardware &amp;amp;amp; Medical equipment from the 25 sectors identified to be given priority. The ordinance route chosen by the government for three out of the above four bills indicates the urgency in reviving the economic growth. Interest rate cuts to help in credit growth: Expectations over RBI cutting the interest rates by over 50 basis points were reflected in 10Year G-Sec yields. The reduction in interest rates coupled with the improving business climate could trigger a pick-up in credit cycle. Subdued inflation amid softening commodity prices: Crude oil prices after falling nearly 40% in 2014, are expected to remain soft in 2015 due to supply glut and lack of consensus among OPEC countries to cut the production. Expectations over lower consumption from China, European Union and lower import demand from the US could keep the global crude oil price under check. Up-cycle in interest rates in the US reflects confidence about the sustainability of growth: US Fed is expected to increase the interest rates by up to 75 bps during 2015, for the first time after 2006, amid expectations over strong recovery in GDP growth to around 3%. The sharp increase could result in outflow of capital from emerging markets to the US. However, rising interest rates reaffirm the health of the US economic recovery. Improved macros could bring stability in Indian currency markets: Amid expectations over lower fiscal deficit of 4% and current account deficit of 2%, on the back of lower import bills for crude oil and gold, INR is expected to display relative strength during 2015. Sustainability of earnings growth: Corporate earnings in India are expected to grow over 15%-18% during 2015, which is likely to be revised further based on improvement on execution at ground level, softening commodity prices and sustainability of the global growth momentum. Large equity issuance through disinvestment: Large equity issuances either to comply with SEBI guidelines on minimum public holding or new issuances like RINL could help the Government in meeting the disinvestment target as well as keep the IPO market buoyant. Money flows into Indian equities to remain robust during 2015: Indian equities continue to be the 2nd best performing asset in the world equity markets, as well as the best performing asset class in India. Indian equities are expected to attract FII inflows in 2015, that were around Rs 97,600 cr in 2014. Amid political/economic stability, direct participation of retail investors has increased, while retail participation through mutual funds has also risen as indicated by the increase in individual folios by 8.4 lakh during Apr-Nov 2014, reflecting confidence among the retail investors on Indian equities. Our take on the marketWe expect Sensex to trade in the band of 27720 - 35640. There could be short-term volatility as markets have priced in growth post the elections and multiples are at the middle of the trading band. The Sensex consensus EPS for FY15E is Rs.1635 and for FY16E is Rs.1980, implying a P/E band of 14 - 18x for FY16EPS. Sensex currently trades at 14x FY16E EPS. We remain overweight on Automobiles, BFSI, Cement, Consumer Goods, Infrastructure, Metals, Software and Pharma. We expectEarnings upgrades and in a more conducive environment for the businesses, corporate earnings are expected to grow over 18% in the next one year On ground execution of the capex cycle to pick up Stable currency and improved government finances along with a decline in inflation likely to present the case for lower interest rates Growing income levels and better job prospects trigger for higher domestic consumption Overall, the scenario is conducive for cyclicals, manufacturing and export oriented sectors. With the expected growth in corporate earnings, continued inflow of funds from FII&amp;amp;rsquo;s and renewed interest from the domestic investors, we expect equities to outperform other asset classes in the next one year and recommend to stay invested in equities. Wealth Maximizer 2015: Our top ten Largecap picks in the Wealth Maximizer (for a time frame of 9-12 months) are Asian Paints, Divis Lab, HDFC Bank, ITC, JSW Steel, L&amp;amp;amp;T, Reliance Industries, Tata Motors,&amp;amp;nbsp;TCS and Ultratech Cement.
