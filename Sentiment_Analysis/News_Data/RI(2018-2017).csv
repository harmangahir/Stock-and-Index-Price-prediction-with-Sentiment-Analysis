Reliance-BP are targeting to bring to production the R-Series and satellite fields in KG-D6 block by 2020, just around the time KG-D6 block's currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields cease to produce.  These fields along with the ultra deep MJ find are to produce 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of peak natural gas.  McDermott's DLV2000 vessel will install deepsea pipelines to connect the R-Series and satellite cluster discoveries to production system.  &amp;quot;2019 will see work pick up speed, three projects on track to bring gas on shore,&amp;quot; BP India tweeted and attached a blog on DLV2000.  DLV2000 is a class 3 dynamic positioning vessel combining a 2,200-tonne revolving crane with a deepwater underdeck S-lay pipeline system configured to install pipelines with diameters ranging from 4.5 to 60 inches in water depths up to 10,000 feet.  &amp;quot;On 26th December, we completed the as planned mobilization of the ?DLV2000 on Reliance R / S Cluster 8 well OBO development project in Bay of Bengal, East Coast India for season 1 offshore campaign,&amp;quot; BP said in the blog.  OBO refers to fields operated by others.  Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP plc holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada holds the remaining 10 per cent.  The D1 and D3 fields, the first of the one-and-a-half dozen gas discoveries in KG-D6 that were brought to production in April 2009, will cease to produce by end-2019 or early 2020.  This shutdown will coincide with upgradation, modification, and preparation of facilities and operating system to connect new fields, sources said, adding the R-Series is likely to give first gas in mid-2020 while satellite and MJ field may begin output in 2021 and 2022.  Reliance has till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to begin production (in September 2008). D1 and D3 fields went onstream in April 2009. ?  MA field stopped production this quarter, sources said, adding that the field at its peak had produced 1,08,418 tonnes of oil in May 2010. Output has been declining since then. It produced 0.14 million barrels (1,960 tonnes) in the April-June quarter.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 mmscmd in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of wells.  D1 and D3 fields too peaked that year in March with an output of 61.4 mmscmd. Output thereafter has only declined. KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This comprised production from both D1-D3 and MA fields.

During that visit, he also held talks with Ambani but choose to tweet about those discussions only this week.  In an Arabic tweet, which was translated using online tools, Al-Falih said he was delighted to meet Ambani.  At the meeting &amp;quot;we discussed opportunities for joint investments and cooperation in petrochemical, refining and communications projects.&amp;quot;  He also tweeted a picture of the meeting where Ambani is dressed in a business suit, a sharp contrast to other pictures of his in traditional attire during the pre-wedding festivities held on December 8 and 9.  No details of the meeting were available from Reliance.  Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar with a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum.  Reliance plans to expand its only-for-exports SEZ refining capacity to just over 41 million tonnes from current 35.2 million tonnes but does not have any plans to set up a new refinery in the country.  It is presently focused on expanding petrochemical and telecom business, industry sources said.  Crude oil is the basic raw material for the manufacturing of petrochemicals.  Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is keen to get a foothold in the world's fastest-growing fuel market so as to get a captive customer for crude oil it produces.  Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, and its partner Abu Dabhi National Oil Co (ADNOC) have picked up 50 per cent stake in a planned USD 44-billion refinery in Maharashtra but the project is facing problems in acquiring land due to protests from local politicians.  Aramco and ADNOC will together hold 50 per cent stake in the 60 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) refinery and adjacent 18 MTPA petrochemical complex planned to be built at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra by 2025.  The two will supply half of the crude oil required for processing at the refinery.  Like other major producers, the two are looking to lock in customers in the world's third-largest oil consumer through the investment. Kuwait too is looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.  Saudi Aramco is also keen on retailing fuel in India. A refinery in India can also be a base for it to export fuel to deficit countries in Europe and the Americas.  India has a refining capacity of 247.6 million tonnes, which exceeded the demand of 206.2 million tonnes."

The unspent component of the mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) rose to Rs 1,717 crore in fiscal 2018 as against Rs 1,574 crore in the previous fiscal year, according to the data released by Prime Database.  The agency did not offer any particular reasons for a large quantum of money going unspent, though. It could be because of there was no demand for the money from third-party agencies or it could be a reflection of the overall rise in the profitability of these companies.  The new Companies Act of 2013 mandates publicly traded companies with Rs 100 crore in annual profit or Rs 500 crore in annual turnover to set aside 2 percent of their profits for affirmative/inclusive social action.  Only half of the 1,708 companies listed on NSE have a CSR committee in place despite the CSR Act mandating the same.  However, the overall spends by the 1,080 NSE-listed companies who fall under the 2 percent mandatory CSR spend category rose 11 percent in fiscal 2018 to Rs 10,030 crore from Rs 9,060 crore in the previous year.  In the past four years since the introduction of the mandatory CSR spends, the spending by the NSE-listed companies has grown at a compounded rate of 16 percent per annum.  It said inequalities reduction, national heritage, the Armed forces, sports, technology incubators and slum development were the most neglected areas when it comes to corporates choosing for their CSR spends.  The spending list was topped by education sector at Rs 3,817 crore and followed by healthcare which saw inflows of Rs 2,509 crore, it said.  Maharashtra topped the list of states receiving the largest amount of money for CSR, followed by Gujarat and Rajasthan, while eight states saw a decline in spends.  The top companies in the list of spenders were led by Reliance Industries at Rs 745 crore, followed by ONGC (Rs 503.44 crore), TCS (Rs 400 crore and HDFC Bank (Rs 374.54 crore), it said.

The company is preparing to take on Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries-owned Reliance Jio&nbsp;by expanding its 4G network mobile tower sites. It is also planning to&nbsp;divide its market into four categories and adopt a specific strategy for each of them, sources told the paper.  The management of the loss-making Vodafone Idea, which was formed after Idea Cellular and Vodafone India merged in August, reportedly held&nbsp;a meeting with telecom analysts on&nbsp;November 21 to discuss its revival plans and strategy.  A person present at the meeting told the paper that the management believes a tariff hike is imminent and that it will be significant one, given the company's negative free-cash situation.  Vodafone Idea currently 4G coverage in 50 percent of the areas it serves. It hopes to push this to 70 percent in the next six months, and to 80 percent in 2019-20, the person was quoted as saying.  The telecom giant is currently awaiting full realisation of merger synergies, as the&nbsp;integration of spectrum assets and networks of both Vodafone and Idea is underway.  The merger of Idea Cellular and Vodafone was triggered by fierce competition in the telecom sector after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.  Vodafone Idea announced its first quarterly results in September, reporting a loss of Rs 4,970 crore. The company's average revenue per user (ARPU) came in at Rs 88, much lower than Airtel's Rs 101 and Jio's Rs 131.70.  Last month, Airtel said it had simplified 7-8 of its tariffs, with minimum recharge plans starting at Rs 35. The aim was to reduce the number of marginal customers it had, control expenses and provide better services to its users.  The board of Vodafone Idea has set up a committee of directors to explore avenues to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore of capital. The committee will also look into a potential sale of the company's fibre network, which has over 156,000 km of intra-city and inter-city fibre routes.  The company has acknowledged a liquidity crunch in the telecom sector and has sought the government's help to meet its financial obligations, a government official said.

Speaking at the 24th MobiCom conference here, Ambani, who heads the oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries, said India's digital transformation is &amp;quot;unmatch and unprecedented&amp;quot; after it took leadership position from being 155th in wireless broadband technology adoption in just 24 months.  Back in the 1990s, when Reliance was building its oil refinery and petrochemical projects, India's gross domestic product (GDP) was around USD 350 billion and had just come out of a severe financial crisis.  &amp;quot;Very few in the world thought that our country's prospects were bright. Today our GDP is nearing USD 3 trillion, and India is well on its way to becoming one of the three richest countries in the world,&amp;quot; he said.  Ambani, the richest Indian, said mobile computing as a catalyst is driving massive data consumption &ndash; and this has given young Indians a fertile ground for disruptive ideas.  Cloud computing and networking technologies have used broadband as a foundational enabler &ndash; leading to Indian entrepreneurs starting to make a global impact.  &amp;quot;In the next two decades, I can confidently say that India shall be leading the world and shall contribute to the next wave of global economic growth,&amp;quot; he said.  India languished on the fringes during the first two industrial revolutions powered by coal and steam and electricity and oil, respectively, and only started playing catch-up in the computer-driven third industrial revolution, he said.  &amp;quot;The fourth industrial revolution is now upon us. It is marked by a fusion of technologies straddling the physical, digital and biological worlds,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I can say with full confidence that India has a chance of not just participating in the fourth industrial revolution, but also leading it.&amp;quot;  This is possible because the India of today is remarkably different from the India of yesterday. &amp;quot;India's vast tech-savvy young population is its key strength. Just imagine the kind of connected intelligence India can create if the power of billion-plus minds is combined!,&amp;quot; he said.  Also, being a democracy that is run on the model of equitable and inclusive growth, it is openly embracing the digital technologies of tomorrow. It is a rich and fertile ground for entrepreneurship and has emerged as the fastest growing start-up base worldwide, he said.  &amp;quot;Today, the nation is home to the third largest number of technology-driven start-ups in the world. Never before has India witnessed such an explosion of entrepreneurial spirit,&amp;quot; he added.  Ambani said India needs to prepare itself for a period of information and digital abundance, adapt itself to the scorching pace of innovation and learn to collaborate on scale, quickly transform the idea into a breakthrough innovation, shift from a system of time-bound education to a mode of continuous learning and create more employment opportunities than what new and disruptive technologies take away.  &amp;quot;We have to groom our children to be digitally-savvy right from school. Schools should train students in 'the four C-s' &ndash; critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. These are the skills required to build the foundation for a sustained leadership in the digital age for India.  &amp;quot;Within a single generation, we can empower and enrich our vast and young human resources to give India a competitive edge in the world,&amp;quot; he said.  Governments, businesses and civil society organisations should put together an ecosystem for massive upskilling of the workforce, he stated.  &amp;quot;We now have the opportunity to digitally reinvent all sectors of our economy &ndash; be it financial services, commerce, manufacturing, agriculture, education, and healthcare. India can leapfrog the competition and lead the world in each of these sectors,&amp;quot; he said.  Ambani said there was a pressing need to create a digital green revolution by encouraging adoption of technologies for water conservation, soil management, precision farming and waste reduction to enhance agricultural productivity.  Secondly, there is a need for good quality education to make India's youth a productive asset, he said adding there is also a requirement to make healthcare affordable.  Talking about Reliance Jio, his telecom venture that stormed the industry by combining free voice calls and SMS with cheap data, he said India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband.  &amp;quot;Jio is determined to move India to among the top 3 in fixed-line broadband, too,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Our state-of-the-art digital infrastructure provides mobile and broadband connectivity across the country, with the largest fibre footprint.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

While the refining and upstream oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segments bore the brunt of rising crude prices, petrochemicals registered healthy top-line growth and margin improvement. However, what stole the show was the momentum observed in the retail (Reliance Retail) and telecommunication (Reliance Jio) divisions.  Mukesh Ambani, in his address to Reliance Industries' shareholders in the FY18 annual report, set his vision to ensure that the revenue contribution of these consumer-centric segments is on par with the non-consumer ones (refining, upstream oil and gas, petrochemicals) over the next decade. Consequently, a major shift in the conglomerate&rsquo;s long-term strategy, which is aimed at tapping markets and consumers across the country, is worth taking note of.  Since B2C segments are steady in nature and also happen to be less volatile to economic/global/commodity uncertainties in comparison to the B2B segments, prospects of revenue and earnings visibility are likely to be better.  Furthermore, it is pertinent to understand the synergies that Reliance Industries could derive by integrating the customer base of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio. For instance, a Jio user can get good deals on purchasing products from the online platforms or brick-and-mortar stores of Reliance Retail, whereas Reliance Retail can leverage its deep pan-India presence to increase the number of Jio subscriptions through various offers.  While Jio&rsquo;s entry in 2016 changed the landscape and dynamics of India&rsquo;s telecom industry dramatically and structurally, Reliance Retail could possibly do the same on the retailing front. So, what&rsquo;s in store for the retail mammoth in times to come?  About Reliance Retail   Reliance Retail is India&rsquo;s biggest multi-category product retailer in terms of store network and sales.        As on 30th&nbsp;September&nbsp;2018, Reliance Retail operated 9,146 stores with an area of over 19.50 million square feet and 512 petro outlets.  Q2 FY19 review  Accelerated store additions and healthy demand across all consumption brackets caused revenues to more than double year-on-year (YoY). Reliance Retail clocked sales of Rs 32,436 crore in Q2 as against Rs 14,646 crore in the same quarter of FY18. 138 new stores and 535 Jio Points were added during the quarter.  Margins for the quarter stood at 3.8 percent, up 155 basis points YoY, on account of operating leverage.  The path ahead  For Reliance Retail, most of the incremental revenue growth in the coming fiscals will be driven by aggressive store additions across all segments (lifestyle, grocery, white goods, fuel, connectivity). Extensive use of omnichannel (i.e. a blend of online and brick-and-mortar retail) will be important in widening the market reach. Therefore, top-line traction is expected to be intact.  In the case of apparel and consumables, the share of private labels to annual turnover is likely to increase gradually too. Besides enhancing brand and product visibility, the move should aid margin accretion owing to economies of scale and lower procurement costs.  With more than 50 million customers already covered under loyalty programmes, a lot would depend on how Reliance Retail capitalises on its&nbsp;strengths to achieve higher conversion-to-footfall ratios. Should it succeed in this regard, the improved asset turns will have a positive rub-off on the financials.  In the case of fuel retailing, top-line growth will be volume-driven. Commissioning of new outlets, coupled with re-commissioning of existing ones, would be the factors to watch out for.  How big can Reliance Retail be?  Amid economic uncertainties at the domestic and international level, consumption theme, being the most secular in nature, has been the Street&rsquo;s favourite. Unsurprisingly, valuations of most retail stocks, even after witnessing sharp corrections of late, continue to trade at elevated multiples.  In the context of Reliance Retail, this fact assumes even more importance considering its huge revenue base, large store count, growing contribution to Reliance Industries&rsquo; consolidated sales in the recent past and an ambitious plan going forward.    Its target is to open more than 6,000 outlets across the nation with a top-line potential of approximately $20 billion by FY20-end.&nbsp;If this goal is achieved, Reliance Retail could capture roughly 5 percent of India&rsquo;s fast-growing retail market.  Given Reliance Retail&rsquo;s growth pace in the past, this objective seems achievable. In the last 5 years, it has been consistently expanding at the rate of more than one new store each day and footfalls at outlets have nearly doubled every 2 years. It also enjoys the first-mover advantage in many cities.  If the recent quarterly results of Reliance Retail are anything to go by, its margins could, at the very least, be in the range of 4.5 to 5 percent by the end of FY20.  Reliance Retail has been valued using the market cap to sales methodology to understand its significance to the parent company (i.e. Reliance Industries). We considered the median market cap to sales multiple of India&rsquo;s leading retail names for our analysis.  Using a market cap to sales multiple of 3, we derive the value of Reliance Retail at Rs 3,73,668 crore, which is close to 56 percent of&nbsp;Reliance Industries' current market capitalization.    If we exclude the retail portion, Reliance Industries&rsquo; market cap stands at approximately Rs 4,13,826 crore. Reliance Retail&rsquo;s valuation, in this case, would be almost similar to all the other segments of Reliance Industries put together.  So, if Reliance Retail is able to earn better margins, its market cap to sales multiple will witness a re-rating. This could be a major game changer for Reliance Industries and drive its valuation upward.  What also sets Reliance Industries apart from the rest is its increasing focus on futuristic businesses. The company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired 12.7 percent stake in SkyTran, a high-speed public transportation (through magnetic levitation) company.  In due course, we see a lot of steam in Reliance Industries on the back of initiatives undertaken by it in synergistic domains (stake acquisitions in Den Networks and Hathway), consumer-oriented consistent growth verticals (Reliance Retail, Reliance Jio) and differentiated technologies (SkyTran). Investors should, therefore, keep a close eye on how developments pan out on the organic and inorganic fronts.

",,"Business, India, Podcast",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/podcast-|-editor39s-pickday-â-why-reliance-is-onacquisition-spree_11565261.html,"Rakesh Sharma Moneycontrol News  The second quarter results of Reliance Industries are out and the response to the earnings has been mixed to say the least. Despite registering its highest-ever quarter profit, Reliance was one of the major drags on the Sensex today. What else is also out is the news that RIL has been making a few new deals.    Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), acquired 12.7 percent shareholding in SkyTran Inc. A US-based technology company, SkyTran aims to solve traffic congestion by introducing personal rapid transit systems. The news of this Reliance alliance with SkyTran comes close on the heels of two strategic investments that RIL made in Den Networks and Hathway Cable and Datacom. RIL made an investment of Rs 2,290 crore for 66 percent stake in Den and Rs 2,940 crore for 51.3 percent stake in Hathway. What these alliances mean for Reliance will be the major talking point on this edition of our Pick of the Day. My name is Rakesh Sharma, and you are listening to Moneycontrol.  Nitin Agrawal, writing for Moneycontrol, goes on to note, &ldquo;In recent times,&nbsp;Reliance Industries (RIL) has shifted its focus from traditional to futuristic businesses driven by advanced technology that could improve quality of life and make the business relevant for the future.&rdquo;  Jio, launched last year and quite possibly the biggest disruptor in the mobile technology space we have seen in recent times, is driven by VoLTE technology, an advanced technology to transfer calls over data networks. It is in the same vein of future-forwardness that this acquisition of 12.7 percent shareholding (on fully diluted basis) in SkyTran can be seen. RIL also has the option to further invest up to $25 million in convertible notes, subject to approval from SkyTran&rsquo;s board.  Anyone stuck in Bangalore traffic, or for that matter, LA traffic, knows only too well what a menace intense road traffic can be to a good quality of life, and indeed economic development across the globe. SkyTran is a company that aims to address this all too familiar, all too global, problem by creating a transport option that is high-speed, scalable, and low-cost. Commenting on the investment, Akash Ambani, Director, Reliance Jio, said, &ldquo;Our partnership with SkyTran reflects our commitment to invest in futuristic technologies. Reliance is well-poised to capitalize on its existing business portfolio and capabilities to accelerate the development of SkyTran across the world and especially in India.&rdquo;  John Cole, Founder and CEO at SkyTran, said, &ldquo;We are excited to be working with Reliance. Reliance brings tremendous infrastructure and technical expertise and the ability to execute at the largest scale. We believe our partnership with Reliance has the potential to improve the lives of people in India and across the globe.&rdquo;  SkyTran, which has partnered with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the US and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in Israel, has developed magnetic levitation (MagLev) technology for implementing personal transportation systems aimed at solving the problem of traffic congestion globally.&nbsp;MagLev is a technology some of us are familiar with &ndash; the fastest speeds achieved for a train &ndash; 603 kmph &ndash; was in Japan by JR Central's L0 superconducting Maglev on 21 April 2015.  SkyTran has 8 approved patents and 40 plus patents are pending approval, globally, including in India. The proposed SkyTran network would consist of &ldquo;computer-controlled passenger pods running on its patented Passive Magnetic Levitation technology and would use IT, Telecom, IoT and Advanced Materials technologies to transport passengers in a fast, safe, green, and economical manner.&rdquo; Following this investment, Reliance said it will work closely with SkyTran to develop pilot implementations followed by implementation of its network in India at scale. Reliance would also play an active role in further advancing the SkyTran solution, especially in Telecom (4G/5G/IoT/Giga Fiber), Digital Platforms and Services, Advanced Materials &amp;amp;amp; Electric Batteries areas. Reliance would also nominate a director on the Board of SkyTran.  Reliance is not the first big name to be interested and investing in SkyTran. The company has received funding from well-known names like Google Chairman Eric Schmidt. Even the US Department of Transportation has provided funding to SkyTran.  The SkyTran partnership with RIL in India aims to address the burgeoning personal and economic problem of road congestion by building a rapid transit system. Run on non-polluting technology, this partnership also aims to address the increasing levels of pollution in modern India. From the perspective of Reliance, the partnership with SkyTran is an indication of a growing willingness to participate in the technology of tomorrow, and position the petrol-to-telecom giant as a leading figure in adapting to the ways of a fast-changing world. Considering the alarming report from the UN IPCC, it is about time that behemoth corporate houses that rely on non-renewable sources not just for their own profits but also as the fuel for nation-building, start thinking of ways to race towards zero emission, and this may well be seen as a token step in that direction. How practical it will be, and if it will ever take off, or levitate shall we say, is anyone&rsquo;s guess.  Recent acquisition spree by alliance  Reliance, being Reliance, does not need the excuse of Diwali and Dussehra to go on a shopping spree. It has been on one for the past year or so. As of July this year, the company had struck at least 12 deals over 12 months with an estimated tab of about Rs 28,900 crore ($4.21 billion), according to calculations by Jefferies Group LLC and Bloomberg. Ten of these are related to Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s consumer business. Ambani has also capitalized on India&rsquo;s ongoing bad-debt issues with purchases of distressed or insolvent companies including a local textile-maker, a carbon-fiber firm and the wireless assets of an indebted telecom company, reported Mint earlier in July this year.  The acquisitions also point to a certain pattern, according to industry-watchers. To build an integrated digital offering around the emerging crown jewel of the Reliance family, Jio. If pre-2017 was the era of petrochemicals and building massive refinery complexes, it seems post-2017 is going to be a new big chapter in the Reliance saga with Jio as its protagonist with all these other acquisitions and deals in one way or other lending a supporting role to the hero, Jio Ambani. Jio Ambani also hopes to be the leader of the new tech space. Last month, RIL invested $8 million in San Diego-headquartered NetraDyne Inc., an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up. In June,&nbsp;RIIHL&nbsp;had invested $16 million in the start-up that focuses on fleet management, automotive, security and surveillance.&nbsp;The company&rsquo;s latest investment translates into a 37.4 percent equity stake in the firm, RIL said in an exchange filing.  In the past year alone, RIL and its subsidiaries, have been acquiring stakes in various ventures that can one way or other be linked to the bouquet offerings that Jio hopes to be &ndash; in terms of boosting digital content for Jio, there are partnerships with The Indian Film Combine, Eros International, and Saavn.  In order to enhance the artificial intelligence arm of Jio, in addition it to its venture with NetraDyne, Reliance has pumped in $180 million in Bangalore-based Embibe, which uses data analytics to deliver personalised learning outcomes to students. KareXpert, another venture that RIL has invested in, is developing a one-stop digital health platform. Earlier in June, Reliance acquired Oregon-headquartered Radisys Corporation, which it said would help accelerate Jio&rsquo;s global innovation and technology in areas of 5G, IoT and open-source architecture adoption.  Considering it&rsquo;s Navratri, I am tempted to think of Durga with her ten arms, each wielding a different weapon. Jio seems to be morphing into a similar entity &ndash; godly or not &ndash; with each of these ventures arming it with new qualities. The businesses that established RIL as a gargantuan force will, no doubt, continue to play a role in the company&rsquo;s evolution into the 21st century, but the lead will be taken over by the new digital kids on the block &ndash; Jio and JioGigaFiber &ndash; currently in prep school, acquiring all that they need to be the new (and hopefully green) leaders of the Reliance family, and therefore by extension, 21st century India.

Although slightly soft compared to the preceding quarter, gross refining margins were substantially above the Singapore benchmark. The overall strong performance was majorly driven by growth in the petrochemical, digital and retail segments. Consumer business maintained its momentum.  Jio continued to impress with quarterly performance. Despite strong competition, operating revenue increased and the company was able to sustain operating margins as well.    Segment wise performance       Petrochemical &ndash; robust performance  As expected, the petrochemical segment reported a robust performance and contributed to overall profitability. The 56 percent topline growth was driven by a mix of higher prices and higher volume, especially in the new products of paraxylene (PX) and refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC). EBIT growth of 63 percent was driven by higher volumes with the stabilisation of the ROGC, its downstream units and the new PX facility. Better margins in the integrated polyester chain also helped improve segment profitability though gains were partially offset by softer polymer margins  Refining - sequentially soft    Gross refining margin at $9.5 per bbl was way above the benchmark Singapore GRM of $6.1 per, but slightly soft sequentially. While revenue increased by 41.6 percent year-on-year (YoY), the segment EBIT declined by 19.6 percent YoY. The performance was affected by substantially higher crude oil prices, soft gasoline margins, and tighter light-heavy differential. The shutdown of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCC) also impacted the segment's performance.  Upstream segment - performance remained weak  Volumes in the upstream oil and gas business saw a natural decline which led to an almost 12 percent contraction in revenue, despite higher prices of crude and gas. Production from both the domestic business and US operations fell 25 and 31 percent, respectively.  Reliance retail &ndash; strong traction  Accelerated store additions and traction across all consumption brackets led to strong revenue growth in the retail segment. Around 138 new stores and 535 Jio Points were added during the quarter. Reliance Retail operated 9,146 stores with an area of over 19.50 million square feet and 512 petro outlets.  Operating leveraged aided a margin expansion of 155 basis points YoY to 3.8 percent.  Going forward, revenue growth will be predominantly driven by network expansion across all verticals (Reliance Trends, Reliance Fresh, Reliance Smart, Reliance Digital, Jio Points).  In the grocery and apparel segments, the emphasis is on improving the private label brands portfolio, developing the omnichannel network and leveraging the loyalty programme customer base of over 50 million customers. In fuel retailing, re-commissioning of fuel outlets and volume growth will be the factors to watch out for.  Jio &ndash; adding to the muscle  Jio&rsquo;s net revenues rose 13.9 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 9240 crore. Growth was driven by a net addition of 37 million subscribers during the quarter. Subscriber addition was higher than all competitors put together and the base has touched 250 million within 25 months of its commencement of services.  Jio&rsquo;s ARPU (average revenue per user) witnessed a marginal dip of 2.1 percent on QoQ basis to Rs 131.7 per month.    Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA margin was flat compared to the preceding quarter. Interest cost outlay increased by 29.7 percent leading to 11.3 percent increase in profit-after-tax (PAT), lower than the growth in EBITDA.  Jio plans to launch JioGigaFiber and reach 50 million homes across 1,100 cities. To expedite this, it has bought a strategic stake in Den Networks Limited (Den) and Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited (Hathway). This will also help Jio access &nbsp;local cable operators, content producers and the companies.  Outlook   RIL has completed most major planned capital expenditures and the units have started stabilizing. With projects starting to deliver, the company is likely to see steady cash flows during the year which would enable further operating efficiencies and higher returns. The overall macro environment is also conducive for the various verticals where the company has exposure.  With full commissioning of the ROGC and PX units, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business.  The company is now focussing on aggressively expanding the retail consumer business presence. The segment has been delivering stellar growth and we expect this to continue and margins to improve further with increasing volumes.  We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of significant capacity, latest 4G technology, rollout of JioGigaFiber, partnership with Den and Hathway and huge unmet potential available in India.

The deal is expected to be positive for the company as it would increase its broadband business, brokerage houses said.  &amp;quot;Potential deal will give Reliance Industries access to broadband homes and subscribers, and will drive market share gains and help gain wallet share among consumers at top-end,&amp;quot; CLSA said in its research note.  Macquarie said the primary benefit of this deal would be gaining access to the last mile, and the deal will strengthen the&nbsp;bargaining power of Hathway and Den with regard to broadcasters.  According to CNBC-TV18 reports on October 16 which quoted unnamed sources, Reliance is likely to announce the&nbsp;acquisition of Hathway Cable and Den Networks on October 17.  The board meetings of both companies Hathway Cable and Den Networks is to be held separately on Wednesday, to consider a proposal for raising funds by issuance of equity shares through one or more methods including further public issue/ADR/GDR/qualified institutional placement/preferential issue.  Even the board meeting of Reliance Industries is scheduled Wednesday to announce earnings for the quarter ended September 2018.  Sources told CNBC-TV18 Reliance may buy stakes via fresh equity issuance, which is likely to trigger an open offer for both companies.  The deal will help boost Reliance Jio's GigaFiber services as it expands its subscriber base and this deal is going to add premium customers for Jio improving their ARPU, above mentioned sources said.  CLSA said the absolute investment for acquisition would be small compared to its telecom capex. Reliance invested $35 billion for capex in its telecom business.  The acquisition will help get permissions, but still investment in laying last mile fibre is required, it feels.  Macquarie said the blending of Hathway and Den's cable operations with Jio&rsquo;s plans will be key monitorable going forward.  The research house feels the deal will strengthen the&nbsp;bargaining power of Hathway and Den with regard to broadcasters, but put pressure on urban-focussed DTH operators like Tata Sky and Airtel.

Weakening rupee combined with a surge in the crude oil prices continue to weigh on the market sentiment.  Though it made an attempt to recover in the middle&nbsp;but the decline in global indices worsened the situation in the following session. The final session brought in some relief as participants took note of recovery in rupee and softening crude oil prices on Monday.  All eyes will be on earnings season as some of the big names like Reliance Industries, Infosys, Hero MotoCorp and ACC will announce their numbers during the week along with several others.  We expect further rebound in markets but the upside also seems capped. The Nifty may face hurdles in the 10,550-10,700 zone while 10,100 would continue to act as crucial support.  Having said that, a lot depends on how earnings pan out. Besides, movement in the rupee and performance of global markets will remain on traders&rsquo; radar. We advise investors to keep hedged positions and focusing more on the stock selection.  Here is a list of top three stock which could give 5-8 percent return in the next 1 month:  Lupin&nbsp;: Buy| Target: Rs 950| Stop loss: Rs 845| Return: 7.9 percent  In line with other pharma majors, Lupin also witnessed some decent profit taking and retraced closer to its immediate support around Rs 830.  After spending nearly a week around that zone, it has surged strongly on Monday and completed the formation of fresh buying pivot. We advise initiating fresh longs within Rs 870-880. It closed at Rs 886.8 on October 15, 2018.  Tata Global Beverage&nbsp;: Buy| Target: Rs 248| Stop loss: Rs 220| Return: 6.8 percent  After a strong rally from Rs 110 to Rs 320, Tata Global has been witnessing a correction for the last nine months or so. It has formed a short-term reversal pattern and is likely to witness a breakout from the declining trend line as well.  The positioning of confirmation indicators is also in favour of further surge. We advise using any dip in the range Rs 228-232. It closed at Rs 234.9 on October 15, 2018.  Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro&nbsp;: Sell Futures| Target: Rs 1,155| Stop loss: Rs 1,265| Return: 5.7 percent  L&amp;amp;amp;T has been consolidating in a broader range of Rs 1,200-1,400 for the last eight months and is currently hovering around the lower end of the range.  Though it has shown the resilience of late but indications are now in the favour of breakdown. Traders can initiate fresh shorts in the range Rs 1,225-1,235. It closed at 1,221 on October 15, 2018.

Revenue is expected to grow robustly at more than 20 percent but due to margin headwinds and extended provisioning requirements of corporate lenders, bottom-line improvement is slow.  For Q2FY19, we expect Nifty companies to report EPS growth of 10 percent. IT, Consumers and global cyclical expected to report healthy numbers while PSU banks, auto and infra to report muted results this quarter.  Automobiles: Revenue growth of 14 percent YoY is expected. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margin is expected to drop on account of rising raw material prices and rupee depreciation. Capacity constraints in 4-wheeler space and competitive intensity in 2-wheeler are added negative.  Infrastructure and capital goods: Slow execution, tightening liquidity and high-interest rates causing stress on working capital of companies. Infrastructure companies may report 25-30 percent sales growth,&nbsp;though&nbsp;the profits may grow by a mere 11 percent.  For capital goods, net profit&nbsp;is expected to decrease by 4 percent, though sales growth of 15 percent is expected for the quarter.  Cement: Volume growths could be at 7 percent for pan-India players and 13-15 percent for companies based in southern India. Petcoke and diesel prices have raised by 5 percent QoQ and imported coal by 9 percent QoQ. These costs will keep net profits growth muted at negative single digit for the industry.  Consumer: Efforts on increasing distribution network will come into play yet again. Volume growth will be backed by sustained rural demand, urban demand recovery and new product launches. Sales growth is expected at 12 percent,&nbsp;EBITDA at 15 percent and profits at 16 percent for the quarter  Healthcare: US sales are expected to stabilise on account of new product launches. Overall sales growth is expected to be at 8 percent while the net profit is expected to decline by 5 percent.  Metals: Buoyant prices will keep sales high,&nbsp;though the volatility in earnings may persist. Sales may grow at 20 percent while net profit is expected grow at 44 percent for the quarter. We expect ferrous companies to report better performance on account of better pricing.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas: Inventory gains and marketing margins are expected to stay healthy. City gas distributors to report a healthy 21 percent sales growth. Reliance may report 52 percent YoY sales growth. ONGC and OIL are expected to witness 45-60 percent growth in EBITDA due to higher realizations.  Technology:&nbsp;The depreciation in rupee will be positive for tech firms. Companies are expected to report an average 22 percent sales and net profit growth for the quarter.  Financials: We may see a&nbsp;healthy advance growth of 25 percent and pre-provisioning profit growth of 12-14 percent&nbsp;in these companies. Though, provisions remain the key component to monitor.  Axis Bank, SBI, Coal India, ONGC, Reliance and Sun Pharma are key contributors to Nifty earnings growth for FY19 and FY20 and thus are the key results to track.

Large telecom operators often borrow funds from the market by issuing bonds of various maturities. If bond yields rise, they would need to pay more interest on the securities they issue.  Since a lot of these companies also borrow from overseas markets&nbsp;regularly,&nbsp;the weakening of the rupee will increase their cost of borrowing in those markets, thereby eroding the benefit they enjoy of raising money from abroad.  &amp;quot;The days of freebies for mobile consumers may be finally coming to an end as the high cost of money is definitely hurting telcos and putting pressure, particularly on the incumbents, which should lead to some tariff hikes in the next two quarters,&amp;quot; Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice-President, Markets and Corporate Affairs, IIFL, told&nbsp;the paper.  Industry experts also believe that mobile tariffs may go up in the next two quarters given that consumption is surging, the cost of diesel is rising and the rupee is weakening.  However, Rajan Mathews, Director General of the Cellular Operators Association of India, observed that fierce competition&nbsp;will likely force telcos to keep tariffs largely unchanged for the next two-to-three quarters.  Reliance Industries-controlled Reliance&nbsp;Jio Infocomm,&nbsp;which has kept tariffs largely unchanged since January, entered the market in September 2016 with competitive prices, pushing other telecom operators to drop rates, analysts told the paper.  While the move benefited subscribers, it weeded out smaller carriers and to consolidated the industry&nbsp;to three large private players -- Vodafone&nbsp;Idea, Bharti Airtel and&nbsp;Jio -- making it an ideal market situation for pricing power to return over time, they said.  Telecom operators may now have to redesign some of their less-popular bundled offers and induce customers to upgrade to higher-value deals for the same amount of data and free voice calls,&nbsp;Bhasin was quoted as saying.  He added that operators could also 'selectively ring in modest increases in monthly rentals of some bundled packs' to boost overall revenue.

Markets fell with above average volumes, suggesting selling by institutional players mainly in hitherto stronger shares including IT services, Reliance Industries, some private banks and insurance companies.  Traders seemed to have taken cues from the technical breach and build short positions in select counters.  Key issues concerning the markets include the direction of the rupee which is the past month's worst performing emerging market currency. It&nbsp;fell to a new record low of 73.90 earlier in the session. On Thursday,&nbsp;however, the rupee showed some signs of stability in the first half of the session.  Market participants are pinning their hope on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and government taking necessary measures to arrest the decline in the value of the rupee.  Most Asian markets are down sharply in response to the spike in US Treasury yields to levels unseen since 2011, which makes it challenging for other asset classes to attract buying. 10-Year yields in the US touched 3.17 on Wednesday and has inched up further on Thursday.  Crude prices which have touched a 4-year high is another reason for concern for Indian markets as it affects the macros and then indirectly the growth rate of the economy.  Trade war situation seems to be escalating lately which could impact global trade and its consequent effect on the Indian economy.  The government has been proactive and trying to tackle the situation keeping fiscal discipline in mind. Timely apt decisions (a series of them) from the govt/RBI could help in turning around the sentiments in the bond and equity markets even as one hopes that the global situation does not worsen much in the near term.  While the Indian markets are now much cheaper than a month back, analysts will have to rework their earnings estimates based on the recent developments locally and across the globe.

However, oil consumption will still increase to 480 million tonnes by 2040 as the renewable push will not completely halt oil demand growth, he said, citing official statistics.  To meet that consumption, India has been boosting its overall refining capacity with first production from its upcoming West Coast refinery expected in 2022.  India has plans to add 190 million tonnes per year of refining capacity over the next 10 years to its existing 228 million tonnes per years, he said.  &amp;quot;Over a period of time, some additional refining capacity would also come and some of the exports which are happening through the private sector will probably get curtailed and would get consumed in the country itself,&amp;quot; he said.

",,"Business, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance-permanently-shuts-down-ma-oil-fieldkg-d6-block_11452361.html,"Reliance Industries Friday said it has permanently shut down its only oil field in the flagging KG-D6 block after production declined to nil. Reliance Industries (RIL) had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.  &amp;quot;This is to inform that MA (D26) field in Block KG-DWN-98/3 (KGD6), which is being operated by RIL as an operator of the joint venture consisting of RIL (60 per cent), BP (30 per cent) and NIKO (10 per cent), has ceased production on September 17, 2018,&amp;quot; the company said in a regulatory filing.  Post-cessation, activities related to the safe shutdown of the field are underway.  &amp;quot;Production from the field had been under natural decline and facing continuous challenges due to high water production and sand ingress. The field has cumulatively produced about 0.53 trillion cubic feet of gas and 31.4 million barrel of oil and condensate and had no remaining reserves,&amp;quot; the company said.  For Q1 FY19, MA field contributed less than 0.1 per cent in terms of revenue at RIL consolidated level.  RIL said the Dhirubhai-26 (D26) oil, gas and condensate deep-water discovery was made in 2006. The discovery was developed and put on production in September 2008.  This was India's first deepwater development (water depth up to 1,250 metres), with seven wells tied back through a sub-sea production system to a purpose-built, state of the art dis-connectable turret moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) production facility.  &amp;quot;Relevant governmental agencies have already been informed,&amp;quot; it added.  The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).  Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in April-June quarter this year.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic meter per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 and D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.  Output, thereafter, has only declined.  KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 and D3 and MA fields.The shutdown of the MA field coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a FPSO unit, which processes output from the field.  Reliance is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.  RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.  The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.

The company has officially thrown open the window starting August 15, 12am midnight. Interested users can get themselves registered on the MyJio app or on Jio&rsquo;s official website Jio.com.  The fixed-line fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service will rollout broadband connections with speeds of up to 1 Gbps to more than 1,100 cities simultaneously across the country. Apart from ultra-high data transfer speeds, GigaFiber will provide a host of other services such as high speed wall-to-wall Wi-Fi coverage, IPTV, D2H services, high speed gaming with ping levels as low as 1 ms, etc.  However, registration does not mean users can avail the services right away. In fact, during his speech at the Reliance Industries&nbsp;AGM, when Jio GigaFiber was first unveiled, Mukesh Ambani said, &ldquo;we will prioritise our Jio GigaFiber rollout to those localities from where we receive the highest number of registrations.&rdquo;  This effectively translates to &mdash; the higher the number of interested users in a particular locality, the faster the company will roll out its services there. Once rolled out company will install Jio GigaRouter, which will not only bring ultra-fast broadband speeds, but will also provide wall-to-wall WiFi coverage.  The company will install a second device called the Jio GigaTV set-top box. The box will provide about 600 channels along with other contents such as movies, songs, etc. The box will connect to large-sized televisions and will be capable of dishing out contents in ultra-high 4K resolution.  Why is Jio GigaFiber so important?  Although Reliance Jio is not the first to provide broadband connection through optical fibre cables, it is one of the first to provide the last mile connectivity.  To explain in simple terms, majority of existing internet service providers (ISPs) who provide optical fibre-based broadband services are either FTTB (fiber-to-the-building) or FTTP (fiber-to-the-premises) where the optical fibre reaches only a common distribution node (box) in the building or premises. Hereafter, data is transmitted to the user's house using traditional copper cables which severely cripple high speed data transfer abilities.  However, with FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) broadband service, Jio GigaFiber will ensure that even the last few metres, colloquially known as last-mile, will be connected using fibre optic cable, thereby ensuring a user receives high broadband speeds at all time.  Moreover, Jio is a known disruptor and one can rest assured that Jio GigaFiber will bring broadband services at never-seen-before prices. In fact, various reports speculate Jio GigaFiber will provide broadband data at nearly 50-75% cheaper rates than what the existing ISPs are offering.  How to register for Jio GigaFiber?  Step 1: Open MyJio app/Jio.com website.  Step 2: Tap/click on the &lsquo;Invite Jio GigaFiber Now&rsquo; tab.

In perhaps one of its kind intervention in a deepsea field, RIL-BP has, through the use of a combination of complex techniques, kept the wells flowing at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3) gas fields in the Krishna Godavari basin block KG-D6, they said.  RIL-BP want to keep the system live till the R-Series and Satellite fields in KG-D6 block are ready to produce. The due plan to use existing facilities to produce 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of peak output from R-Series, Satellite, and MJ fields.  The D1 and D3 fields, the first of the one-and-a-half dozen gas discoveries in KG-D6 that were brought to production in April 2009, will cease to produce by end-2019.  This shutdown will coincide with upgradation, modification, and preparation of facilities and operating system to connect new fields, sources said adding the R-Series is likely to give first gas in mid-2020 while Satellite and MJ field may begin output in 2021 and 2022.  The partners, they said, have spent over Rs 7000 crore in sustaining production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, which otherwise would have ceased to produce much earlier. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 witnessed higher than anticipated and sooner than expected sand and water ingress that led to choking of wells after wells since the second half of 2010.  D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 are at the tail-end of their production life and they are being kept alive to preserve the facility for use by the new production from the three projects, sources said.  Besides costing money to first preserve the facilities in case of an early shut-down and later reuse it, a shutdown could have created problems as the system would be idle for too long in the deepwater, they said adding inlet pressure has been delicately reduced to levels where multiple wells could be kept flowing.  Besides, surfactant is being used to lift water from the wells and gas from MA field is being recirculated to keep the line packed and help lift the gas from the remaining fields.  This, they said, can last for only another year -- at which point the quantity of gas will be so low, water production will be beyond what the system can manage, and the pressure will be depleted that no more gas can be produced.  Reliance had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. D1 and D3 fields went onstream in April 2009.  MA field cessation expected by September 2018, sources said, adding that the field at its peak had produced 1,08,418 tonnes of oil in May 2010.  Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in the April-June quarter.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 mmscmd in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.  Output thereafter has only declined.  KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 and MA fields.  RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.  RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.  The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum of 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on Reliance, BP and Niko.  At the time, Reliance disputed the government's demand as being based on a &amp;quot;misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC,&amp;quot; and it said that such a demand was without precedent in the oil and gas industry. It on November 11, 2016, slapped an arbitration notice.  Reliance is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources.  The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee. The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016, report, concluded that there has been &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to the production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML.  It relied on a report produced by petroleum industry consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton which concluded that gas had migrated from ONGC-controlled parts of the sea floor and the geological formations beneath it into areas controlled by the private companies. But Reliance had at that time stated that the methods were flawed.  The government, sources said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from Reliance-BP-Niko for &amp;quot;the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained&amp;quot;.  So, a notice was sent, they said, adding that the government is also pressing Reliance to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than the target.  The cost recovery issue is being arbitrated separately.  Originally, ONGC had sued Reliance for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of Reliance.  Under the direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah, however, said the compensation should go to the government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.

As of the June 2018 quarter, the Mukesh Ambani-led company had an outstanding debt of Rs 2,42,116 crore, which rose from Rs 2,18,763 crore from March 2018, while cash in hand marginally rose to Rs 79,492 crore.  The company had spent around Rs 22,000 crore in capex during the quarter mostly into the still cash-burning telecom venture, and reported a net income of Rs 9,459 crore.  Its outstanding debt has been rising as its fledgling telecom business continues to drain cash.  &amp;quot;We are planning to raise USD 2.7 billion in forex debt through the course of the fiscal 2019. The money will be raised in multiple tranches and will be used to refinance some of our existing high cost forex debt,&amp;quot; a senior company official told PTI over the weekend refusing to reveal more information.  More than half of Reliances around USD 34 billion debt is due for repayment by 2022, while around USD 13 billion is maturing from 2018 through 2020. Most of the outstanding debt is denominated in foreign currencies.  Reliance has sought shareholders approval to issue redeemable non-convertible debentures at its July 5 AGM, it said in its annual report.  Due to the high rating at BBB+ (by S&amp;amp;amp;P Global Ratings) which is two notches higher than the sovereign rating, Reliance can raise cheaper funds. Moodys has a Baa2 rating on the company, a notch above the governments rating.  Reliance is the only private sector company in the country that has issued perpetual bonds to foreign investors a few years back. The only other domestic entity to tap the perpetual bond market is the state-run State Bank of India.  According to investment bankers, Reliances repayments from 2018 through 2020 will be its biggest for any three-year period in the past and include about USD 8.14 billion term loans, USD 3.52 billion bonds and a USD 300 million revolver loan. It also has about USD 1.65 billion in interest payments.  In the June 2018 quarter its finance cost jumped more than threefold to Rs 3555 crore on an annualised basis.  The retail-to-refining giant debt has trebled over the past five years as it invested a whopping USD 37 billion in a telecom venture and to bolster its traditional petrochemicals business which included a pet coke gasification unit and in expanding petrochemicals capacities.  Telecom is still cash burning having sucked in around Rs 22,000 crore in the June quarter.  During the recent AGM, the billionaire owner Ambani, who is the richest Asian, said his vision for the group was to become a consumer company over the next decade. Already, 31 per cent of its revenue is coming from retail and telecom business as per its June quarter numbers.  In the June quarter, Jio, was launched just two years ago, had reported a net income of Rs 612 crore, while the market leader Airtel had plunged into a whopping Rs 980 crore loss from its domestic operations. Jio with it loads of cheap data offering, entry has crippled the once-sun-shine telecom market.  The record net income in the June quarter was led by bumper earnings from retail business, improved profitability of telecom arm and near-doubling of earnings from petrochemical business offset lower margins from oil refining business.  Consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore was 17.9 per cent higher than Rs 8,021 crore that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate had netted and exclude a Rs 1,087 crore exceptional income from the sale of a stake in Gulf Africa Petroleum Corp. Revenue rose 56.5 per cent at Rs 1,41,699 crore thanks to the spike in oil prices.

Reliance had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.  &amp;quot;MA field cessation expected by September 2018,&amp;quot; the company said in an investor presentation post announcing first-quarter earnings.  The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).  Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in April-June quarter, Reliance said in the presentation.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 &amp;amp;amp; D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic meter per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.  Output thereafter has only declined.  Reliance said KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 and MA fields.  In April the company had stated that &amp;quot;adhering to Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted Bank Guarantee for Decommissioning activity for existing producing fields&amp;quot;.  While the company had not provided any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields then, it has now said MA field would shut in September.  The shutdown coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field.  Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 percent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 percent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 percent.  The government's Site Restoration Guidelines provide for a one year notice for decommissioning of facilities.  Reliance had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.  The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.  RIL in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries -- R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in the KG-D6 block at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak output. Initial gas will start flowing from 2020.

Refining margins were soft, in line with global trends, but record volumes in the petrochemical segment more than compensated for it. Retail too saw yet another quarter of robust growth.  Jio continued to post strong revenue growth, along with an improvement in operating profitability during the quarter.    Segment wise performance      Petrochemicals &ndash; record performance   Petchem segment reported record earnings with a 58 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in realizations and a stellar 95 percent YoY uptick in profitability. Margins improved 370 basis points YoY. The strong performance was driven by 1) robust 35 percent increase in volumes 2) improved realization with uptick in crude 3) commissioning and stabilization of the refinery of gas cracker unit (ROGC) and its downstream units 4) improved polyester margins 5) stable polymer margins 6) rapid growth in domestic demand for petchem products 7) globally improving product prices  Refining &ndash; lower refining margin in line with global trend    Refining contributes more than two third of the group&rsquo;s revenues. Performance was slightly tepid during the quarter with gross refining margins (GRM) at $10.5 per &nbsp;barrel (bbl) (Q1FY18: $11.9/bbl). However, the softness was in line with weak global GRMs, but a good $4.5/bbl above the Singapore benchmark margins. While revenue increased 43 percent YoY, earnings before interest and taxes (excluding exceptional items) declined 17 percent due to 1) weakness in gross refining margins 2) lower crude throughput 3) adverse movement in Brent-Dubai differentials 4) weak gasoline prices due to higher inventory across the globe and higher exports from China due to low internal growth.  Retail downstream oil business reported strong growth during the quarter with 25 percent YoY increase in gasoline volumes. The company now plans to re-commission fuel outlets in order to drive further volume growth.  Oil and Gas &ndash; earning erosion continues  The upstream oil and gas segment saw improved realization with an 8 percent YoY growth in revenue due to rapid uptick in the oil and gas prices globally. However with declining volumes in both domestic (down 11.8 percent) and US shale (down 26.6 percent), the segment EBIT continued to be negative. Incremental production from the CBM block neutralized the dip in production from the KG D6 basin. The company now plans to start monetizing its KG D6 block and drilling work has started in July.  Retail &ndash; expanding rapidly  Rapid store expansion, coupled with improved customer engagement processes across all segment, helped the retail segments top-line grow 123 percent YoY during the quarter, despite a high base last year. Margins improved 160 basis points led by emphasis on cost control initiatives and benefits of operating leverage owing to additional stores.  &nbsp;Fashion - Aggressive store expansion, loyalty programmes, tie-ups with leading foreign apparel brands, foray into the mothercare category, online sales (through AJIO), and higher contribution of private labels should help RR consolidate its strengths better.  Grocery &ndash; The quarter saw robust growth across all sub-segments (home and personal care, staples, fruits, vegetables). We believe improved brand visibility with store additions will attract more footfalls and increase volumes.  Reliance Digital &ndash; The company plans to undertake integration of its existing 305 physical digital stores with new &lsquo;Jio Points&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reliance ResQ&rsquo; (the service arm) centres which would help further widen the customer base in the upcoming quarters.  Jio &ndash; continues capturing the market  Jio&rsquo;s operating revenues revenue rose 13.8 percent YoY to Rs 8,109 crore (up 13.8 percent quarter-on-quarter). The division added 28.7 million net subscribers over the last quarter, expanding the subscriber base to 215.3 million at the end of June 2017. Jio achieved a subscriber base of 200 million within 21 months of starting operations.  Despite strong competition, Jio&rsquo;s ARPU (average revenue per user) witnessed a marginal dip of 1.9 percent QoQ. (Airtel posted a decline of 9.5 percent).    Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA margins expanded 100 bps to 38.8 percent, a commendable achievement. This was helped by a reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 15 percent of revenues from operations to 13 percent in this quarter (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) cut interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).  Outlook   Post the end of an aggressive capex cycle, RIL is now in a sweet spot. Most of its projects are in the monetization phase, and this will boost cash flows in quarter ahead, in turn improving operating efficiencies. The overall macro environment is also quite conducive for the various verticals where the company has exposure.  With full commissioning of the refinery off gas cracker plant, the petchem segment reported a strong growth which is expected to continue and further grow given the rapidly growing domestic demand. With higher vertical integrations, we expect margins in this segment to expand.  The company is now focused on aggressively expanding the retail consumer business presence. We expect the stellar performance to continue and margins to improve further with increasing volumes.  We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of significant capacity, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India.

Here is a list of top 10 takeaways from RIL Q1 results:  Net Profit:  The Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas major, RIL reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,485 crore for the quarter ended June 30 which was slightly lower than a CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 9,570 crore.  Total Revenue:  Consolidated revenue during the quarter increased 10.1 percent sequentially to Rs 1.29 lakh crore, backed by growth across the board.  Increase in revenue is primarily on account of higher realizations of refining and petrochemical products led by 49 percent YoY increase in Brent oil price. &ldquo;Increased revenues also reflect higher volumes with start-up and stabilization of petrochemicals projects,&rdquo; said the release.  Operating Profit:  Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 64.6 percent to Rs 20,661 crore ($ 3.0 billion) from Rs 12,554 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Record operating performance was led by 33 percent volume growth and significant margin improvement in petrochemicals business, said the release.  GRMs:  Gross refining margin, or what the company earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, came in at $10.5 per barrel which was in-line with a CNBC-TV18 poll of $10.85/bbl.  Reliance Jio:  Reliance telecom venture Reliance Jio reported a net profit of Rs 612 crore for the quarter ended June which was higher than a CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 567 crore. Reliance Jio reported a net profit of Rs 510 crore in the previous quarter.

The net subscriber addition for the Company during the past twelve months has been 92 million, which was the highest in the industry by a substantial margin.  Petrochemical Business:  1Q FY19 revenue from the Petrochemicals segment increased by 58.2 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 40,287 crore ($ 5.9 billion) due to 35 percent increase in volumes and about 24 percent higher realizations. Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level of Rs 7,857 crore ($ 1.1 billion) supported by strong YoY volume growth led by successful stabilization of the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC, its downstream units, and PX-4.  The sharp increase in segment performance also reflects improvement across polyester chain margins and stable polymer margins said the press release posted by RIL on exchanges.  Refining Revenue:  1Q FY19 revenue from the Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing segment increased by 42.9 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 95,646 crore ($ 14.0 billion) while Segment EBIT declined by 16.8 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 5,315 crore ($ 776 million).  Lower crude throughput due to the planned turnaround of one Crude distillation unit and softer refining margins led to decline in Segment EBIT on YoY basis. R&amp;amp;amp;M performance was also impacted by higher flat price and adverse movement in Brent-Dubai differentials on a YoY basis.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas Business:  Q1 FY19, revenue for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment increased by 8.2 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 1,432 crore. The increase is predominantly due to higher gas and oil price realisation.  Segment EBIT stood at (447) crore was impacted by lower volumes due to natural decline. On a YoY basis, domestic production declined by 11.8 percent to 17.9 Bcfe and production in US Shale operations declined by 26.6 percent to 28.7 Bcfe.  Organised Retail Business:  Revenue for Q1 FY19 grew by 123.7 percent YoY to Rs 25,890 crore from Rs 11,571 crore. Rapid store expansion along with superior customer value proposition across all consumption baskets supported revenue growth.  The benefits of a strong focus on cost control, scalability and operating leverage is reflecting in 3x EBITDA growth on a Y-o-Y basis. Retail EBIT margin expanded YoY to 4.1 percent.

The year-on-year bottomline growth was 4.5 percent.  Consolidated revenue during the quarter increased 10.1 percent sequentially (up 42 percent YoY) to Rs 1.29 lakh crore. The growth was primarily on account of higher realisations of refining and petrochemical products led by 49 percent YoY increase in Brent oil price.  Increased revenues also reflected higher volumes with start-up and stabilisation of petrochemicals projects, RIL said, adding robust growth in consumer businesses provided a further boost to revenues.  On the operational front, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) jumped 11.9 percent to Rs 20,661 crore with margin expansion of 20 basis points sequentially at 16 percent.  &amp;quot;We continue to focus on strong delivery through operational excellence in portfolio of businesses.

Ambani said petrochemicals business generated record EBITDA with strong volumes and an upswing in polyester chain margins. &amp;quot;Refining business performance remained steady despite the seasonal weakness in cracks. Continuing strength in global demand for oil products and implementation of more stringent environmental norms for marine fuels augurs well for our refining business.&amp;quot;  The revenue from its oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment increased 92 percent QoQ to Rs 1,432 crore with narrowing EBIT loss at Rs 447 crore against loss of Rs 600 crore.

Consumer Business  Mukesh Ambani said consumer businesses continued to scale new highs and now account for nearly 21 percent of consolidated segment EBITDA.  Retail business revenues have more than doubled and EBITDA has trebled on a YoY basis and Jio added a record number of subscribers, highlighting the compelling technology and value proposition that Jio offers vis-a-vis other networks, he added.  Jio continued its momentum with profit growing 20 percent sequentially to Rs 612 crore for the quarter ended June. Its profit in the March quarter stood at Rs 510 crore.  Revenue from operations grew by 13.8 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 8,109 crore in Q1FY19 with EBITDA rising 16.8 percent to Rs 3,147 crore and margin expansion of 100 basis points at 38.8 percent.  Jio has seen net additions of 28.7 million subscribers during the quarter (which was 8.3 percent higher compared to 26.5 million additions in the March quarter), taking total subscriber base to 215.3 million.  &amp;quot;215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world,&amp;quot; Ambani said, adding the continued strength in financial results of Jio despite competitive intensity reinforces the customer uptake of its services and its strong operating leverage.  Average revenue per user for the quarter came in at Rs 134.50 against Rs 137 in the previous quarter  Voice consumption in Q1 stood at 744 minutes per user per month and average data consumption per user per month was 10.6 GB.  Reliance said digital services revenue during the quarter increased 14.6 percent sequentially to Rs 9,653 crore with its EBIT growing 14.7 percent to Rs 1,715 crore.  Retail business registered a 7.1 percent sequential growth at Rs 25,890 crore with its EBIT rising 12.4 percent to Rs 1,069 crore.  &amp;quot;I don&rsquo;t think anyone expected this kind of EBIT margin and sequential growth. In fact, if one negates deferred tax from the profit before tax (PBT), the numbers are excellent, specifically on the organised retail front. Both petchem and retail are a blast for the company,&rdquo; SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18.  Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital Management feels the stock would get rerated soon and it may start the next week above Rs 1,200.  On Friday, the stock price closed at Rs 1,129.60, up Rs 19.25, or 1.73 percent ahead of earnings announced after market hours.  The scrip price gained 22 percent in 2018 on top of 70.5 percent upside seen in the previous year, majorly backed by Jio performance, stable refining business and consistent growth in petrochemical segment.

Brokerage houses expect the company's petrochemical business to post strong results. Also in focus would be its telecom business Jio.  RIL's stock has rallied 21 percent in 2018 on top of a 70.5 percent surge in the previous year. It is Rs 28 away from its record high of Rs 1,138.25 touched last week.  Here are key factors to watch out for in June quarter earnings:  Profit  Brokerages expect the Mukesh Ambani-owned conglomerate to report stable growth in standalone profit but consolidated profit is expected to get a boost from the Jio business.  &amp;quot;We expect standalone net income to remain stable, as gains from a weaker rupee and modestly higher petchem volumes/margins will likely be offset by lower refining margins,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  The research house expects a&nbsp;modest increase in consolidated profit driven by higher contribution from Jio.  Prabhudas Lilladher expects standalone earnings at around Rs 8,570 crore due to weak refining margins; factored in $11 a barrel. &amp;quot;We have factored in refining thruput at 16.9MTPA (Q4FY18 16.7MTPA). However, firm petrochemical spreads and higher volumes will support petrochemicals earnings.&amp;quot;  Standalone PAT is expected to increase by 6.1 percent YoY to Rs 8,696 crore as the impact from lower GRM will be mitigated by higher petchem volumes and weaker rupee, HDFC Securities said.  Refining business  Gross refining margin (GRM) is expected to be in the range of $10-11 a barrel for the quarter against $11 a barrel in Q4FY18.  The Singapore Complex GRM was down 6 percent YoY (down 13 percent QoQ) to $6 per barrel in Q1FY19 versus $7 per barrel in Q4FY18 and $6.4 per barrel in Q1FY18.  Crude oil price continued to trend upward in April-June quarter Average Brent crude price was up 48 percent YoY and 11 percent QoQ to $74.5 per barrel during the quarter.  Motilal Oswal expects RIL to clock GRM of $10.3/bbl due to slightly weak benchmark (premium of $4.3/bbl) while HDFC Securities expects GRM of $10.8 per barrel during the quarter.  Petrochemical business  All brokerage houses feel the petrochemical business will do well in the quarter.  &amp;quot;Petchem segment is expected to do better, led by healthy petchem deltas and strong volume growth,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said.  Edelweiss said petchem earnings are likely to grow by 6 percent as new capacities ramp up. &amp;quot;We expect continued benefit from US ethane imports and recently commissioned offgas cracker.&amp;quot;  Higher petchem earnings are due to ramp in production from ROGC and Px plants, HDFC Securities feels.  Petrochemical business in Q4FY18 grew by 13 percent QoQ and its EBIT by 11.9 percent QoQ.  Jio  Jio, which clocked standalone net profit at Rs 510 crore in the March quarter, is expected to show good growth again in June quarter.  Kotak estimates Jio's reported profits to increase to Rs 600 crore in Q1FY19 while HDFC Securities expects a revenue growth of 5.4 percent QoQ which would be led by 15 percent subscriber growth to 21.5 crore subscribers and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to grow by 3.4 percent QoQ.  Jio in Q4FY18 had clocked 3.5 percent revenue growth and 3.8 percent EBIT growth QoQ.

The liability is to be split between the three companies in proportion to their stake in the fields. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has 40 percent interest while RIL and Shell hold 30 percent each.  In a written reply in Rajya Sabha, Pradhan said that based on the Final Partial Award (FPA) dated October 12, 2016, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had on May 25, 2017, raised demand for USD 3.8 billion on ONGC, RIL and Shell towards government of India share of profit petroleum and royalty.  RIL and Shell challenged the FPA before the High Court in London. ONGC was not party to the arbitration.  &amp;quot;The High Court, London rejected the petition filed by RIL and Shell on April 16, 2018, except on one issue which was remanded to the Arbitral Tribunal,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;For enforcement of the FPA, Government has filed a petition before the Delhi High Court.&amp;quot;  In December 2010, BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Ltd, which was subsequently acquired by Shell, and RIL, initiated an arbitration against the Government of India (GoI) after a dispute over the state's share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast.  The Arbitration Tribunal gave its FPA on October 12, 2016. RIL and Shell initiated proceedings under English Arbitration Act 1996 to challenge the arbitration award before the English Commercial Court in November 2016.  On May 2, 2018, the Court delivered its final judgment, remitting a significant issue for redetermination by the Tribunal within three months while disposing of eight other issues, RIL had said on May 24.  The Arbitration Tribunal has scheduled a hearing to determine the remitted issue and will thereafter deliver an award, it had said.  It had insisted that before taking up the issue of quantification of liability, the Tribunal has to decide the issue which is remitted by the English court to it.  BG-RIL propose to file an application to the Tribunal for the increase of Cost Recovery Limit which they are entitled to do under the Production Sharing Contracts.  &amp;quot;Tribunal can consider the issue of quantification of liability (if any) only after these two issues are decided,&amp;quot; RIL had said. &amp;quot;Several issues relating to the claim made by GOI are subject to pending arbitration proceedings.&amp;quot;  Pradhan said out of the four arbitration initiated by RIL in respect of its Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6, only two are under adjudication.  The firm has withdrawn the arbitration against a delay in notifying a gas price and the one against taking away of some area in the KG-D6 block after the expiry of stipulated timeframe.  The arbitrations under adjudication include one against the government disallowing certain costs for KG-D6 output not meeting the targets because of non-drilling of stipulated wells, he said.  The second arbitration is against the government seeking compensation from RIL and its partners for producing natural gas belonging to state-owned ONGC, he added.

However, some 60 percent of the August volumes were considered off-specification as the grade does not meet the requirements of the petrochemical industry standard, the traders added.  It is unclear why Reliance's naphtha contains more oxygenates than usual. Reliance officials were not available for immediate comment.  Reliance had offered the long-range tanker size cargo for end-August loading from Sikka Port in western India through a tender which closes on Wednesday.  But the cargo contains 100 parts per million (ppm) of total oxygenates, twice the acceptable amount for making petrochemicals.  The fuel, however, could still be used but only if buyers have the means to lower the oxygenates levels.  Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in western India, has already sold one such cargo with 100 ppm oxygenates to Vitol for early August loading at discounts to Middle East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.

India Gas Solutions Pvt Ltd -- the 50:50 JV of UK's BP Plc and Reliance Industries, is making its maiden foray in city gas distribution as it put in the bid for 15 cities, sources said.  IGL, which retails CNG in the national capital region, is putting in bids for 13 cities, they said.  Essel Infraprojects Ltd has put in a total of seven bids.  As many as 86 geographical areas (GAs), made by clubbing adjacent districts, are on offer in the 9th city gas distribution (CGD) bidding round.  The GAs cover 24 percent of the country's area and 29 percent of its population.  The round is likely to attract investments of Rs 70,000 crore, according to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB).  The government is targeting to raise the share of natural gas in primary energy basket to 15 percent from 6 percent at present, within a few years.  The bid round is also aimed at meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of giving piped cooking gas connection to 1 crore households, roughly triple the current size, by 2020.  The CGD licenses on offer are for Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh; Ahmednagar in Maharashtra; Ludhiana and Jalandhar in Punjab; Barmer, Alwar and Kota in Rajasthan; Coimbatore and Salem in Tamil Nadu; Allahabad, Faizabad, Amethi and Rai Bareli in Uttar Pradesh; Dehradun in Uttarakhand and Burdwan in West Bengal.  Prior to the 9th round, 91 GAs were awarded to firms like Indraprastha Gas Ltd and GAIL Gas Ltd, which are serving 240 million population, 42 lakh domestic consumers and 31 lakh CNG vehicles.  Of these, 56 GAs were awarded through bidding rounds and the rest on government nomination.  The bid round is being held on changed parameters after one paisa bids spoilt the initial auction rounds.  Bidders have been asked to quote the number of CNG stations to be set up and the number of domestic cooking gas connections to be given in the first eight years of operation.  In the previous eight rounds, bidders were asked to quote only the tariff for the pipeline that carries gas within the city limits. These bidding criteria did not include the rate at which an entity would sell CNG to automobiles or piped natural gas to households using the same pipeline network, leading to companies offering one paisa as the tariff to win licenses.  In the new guidelines, maximum weightage of 50 percent has been given to the number of piped gas connections proposed in eight years from the date of authorisation, as compared to 30 percent earlier.  The number of CNG dispensing stations proposed to be set up has been assigned 20 percent weightage. Length of the pipeline to be laid in the GA and the tariff proposed for city gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has been assigned 10 percent weightage each.  Also, a floor tariff of Rs 30 for city gas and Rs 2 per kg for CNG has been put in order to deter bidders from quoting unviable tariff of 1 paisa per unit.  Companies having a net worth of not less than Rs 150 crore can bid for cities with a population of 50 lakh and more while the same for cities with the population of 20 lakh to 50 lakh has been proposed at Rs 100 crore.  The net worth eligibility goes down with population, with a Rs 5 crore net worth firm being eligible to bid for cities that have less than 10 lakh population.  Last few rounds of CGD have evoked a lukewarm response. The fourth round was altogether canceled, while the fifth saw a sparse response.  The sixth round of bidding for 34 cities in 2015 got bids for only 20. The seventh round of bidding done to set up CGD infrastructure in 11 smart cities under smart city mission received only 1 bid.  Seven cities were offered in the 8th round last year but not all cities have been awarded so far.

Existing broadband service providers struggle to provide broadband at 20 Mbps in the national capital though some claim to have speed of 100 Mbps. 1 Gbps is equal to 1,000 Mbps. The company is targeting 5 crore JioGigaHomes in the first phase.  Clearly, JioGigaFiber could disrupt the fixed broadband market and its pricing in much the same manner that Jio&rsquo;s 4G VOLTE mobile services did, making voice calls almost free and taking data prices to one-tenth of their then prevailing levels.  After announcing the launch of JioGigaFiber, Ambani stepped aside for a while to let his daughter Isha, son Akash and Reliance Jio Director Kiran Thomas address the audience. Isha said the three most popular apps&nbsp;&mdash; WhatsApp, YouTube and Facebook&nbsp;&mdash; will be available on JioPhone from August 15.  She also announced the launch of JioPhone2, a premium version of the popular smartphone JioPhone that has already notched up 25 million users.&nbsp;JioPhone2 will be an affordable high-end mobile with a horizontal screen display. It will be retailed for Rs 2,999 from August 15.  Aiming to increase the affordability of JioPhone and bring it to more users, Isha said users will be able to buy new JioPhone by exchanging their existing feature phone for a mere Rs 501 from July 21. The company has called the scheme &lsquo;JioPhone Monsoon Hungama&rsquo;.  Ambani has set a target of 100 million JioPhone users in the &ldquo;shortest possible time&rdquo;.  Delivering the superfast broadband services to homes would be the JioGigaRouter. JioGigaFiber services will also allow TV-to-TV calling within the comfort of homes. The company will also launch JioGigaRouter to deliver over 600 channels to TV.  In the world of Netflix, all this will undoubtedly cause major disruption in the not-so-flexible direct-to-home and cable TV markets and not just the fixed line broadband segment.  The company will also launch Jio Smart Home Accessories like sensors to detect and regulate water leak, temperature, lighting and electrical appliances.

RIL, or Reliance Industries Limited, led by Mukesh Ambani, shared its numbers today.  The company announced a host of new decisions that could impact many sectors across the economy.  Let&rsquo;s do a quick check on what has been said so far.  Reliance Industries Limited held its 41st Annual general meeting today. Mint had noted last year that RIL&rsquo;s annual shareholder meetings have always seemed like a big fat Indian wedding.    Everyone wants to go and grab a bite. Considering that RIL is credited with kicking off an equity culture in India that seems a fair assessment.  Besides, Reliance has rewarded shareholders generously over the years. Mr Ambani noted at last year&rsquo;s AGM that if a person had invested Rs 1,000 invested in his company back in 1977, that amount would have been worth Rs 16.5 lakh in 2017.  And since this is Reliance, let&rsquo;s look at the scale of the meeting. RIL has approximately 2.4 million retail shareholders. 33 years ago, in 1985, 12,000 shareholders attended the Reliance AGM in Mumbai. In 1986, that number shot up to 35,000. Last year, 2000 people attended while most people watched the proceedings over the internet, especially the chairman&rsquo;s speech. Also, shareholders received a 1:1 bonus offer.  RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani noted the conglomerate&rsquo;s continued success and remarked that it is going through a golden decade. Ambani said, &ldquo;...profits are up by 20.6% to Rs 36,075.crore (for FY18). Reliance has reached an inflexion point.&amp;quot; He mentioned that Jio and the Retail business&rsquo; share in overall EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization, has risen from 2% to 13%.  In last year&rsquo;s AGM, telecom arm JIO took centre stage, with Ambani&rsquo;s heirs, son Akash and daughter Isha launching the new Jio phone. There was a near spectacle, with a display of the trailer for the film Bahubali 2 thrown in as well.  This year, the company continued with its trend of making big announcements related to telecom. Jio, which was launched in 2016, has taken the Indian mobile telephony market by storm. Jio&rsquo;s with attractive offers, or outrageous if you are the competition, forced massive price revisions by rival companies.  The newcomer made a profit of approximately Rs 510 crore for the fourth quarter. It had logged a profit of Rs 504 crore in the October-December quarter.  In today&rsquo;s meeting, Ambani noted that Reliance Industries is India's largest payer of GST, excise and customs duty as well as income tax. He claimed Reliance Jio has doubled its customer base in less than two years to 215 million users, a feat he said no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world. Voice usage data shows that Reliance Jio clocks 530 crore minutes per day.  He made another announcement that could well trigger another price war: the commercial launch of JioGigaFiber. This is RIL&rsquo;s fiber-based broadband connectivity on which the company made an investment of Rs 2,50,000 crore. Isha Ambani, daughter of the chairman, summed it up thus: &ldquo;Gone are the days of Mbps, now it will about Gbps.&rdquo;  What&rsquo;s more, RIL is calling this FTTH, or Fiber to the home. In simpler terms, your fiber internet connection reaches only till the premises, after which copper cables are used for the last stretch of the connection.  his affects your connection speed. RIL claims it will provide fiber all the way to your individual building. Reliance will make its GigaFiber service available in 1,100 cities and towns across the country and will be adding new users starting August 15th. If you are one for beta-testing such a network, well, Reliance is currently running beta trials on &lsquo;tens of thousands of homes for the JioGigaFiber.&rsquo; If you want to sign up, head over to Jio.com.  Not surprisingly, Dalal Street saw some heartburn as shares of cable TV service providers fell when Reliance announced the launch of JioGigaFiber. Bloomberg noted that Hathway Cable fell 4.13 percent, Den Networks went down 5.4 percent and SITI networks was down 2.9 percent.  And that&rsquo;s not all regarding data. Looks like Reliance is betting big on data consumption. Mukesh Ambani shared that data usage increased to 240 crore GB per month from 125 crore. Video consumption increased to 340 crore hours per month from 165 crore hours per month.  The other marquee announcement today was the Jio Phone 2. The new phone will be higher-end compared to last year&rsquo;s Jio phone. It will feature horizontal screen viewing and a QWERTY keypad. The phone will cost Rs 2,999 and will also feature Facebook, YouTube and WhatsApp.&nbsp; Existing Jio users, who now number around 25 million, can upgrade to the new phone by paying just 501 rupees.  Mukesh Ambani added that, &ldquo;All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business.&rdquo;  With the showpieces done, the AGM moved to other RIL businesses like retail, entertainment and hydrocarbon.  Speaking about Reliance retail, the group&rsquo;s chairman said &amp;quot;Reliance market has been creating value for small merchants.&amp;quot; Over 350 million footfalls were received by 7,500 Reliance retail stores over the last year.  And more than 4,000 new stores were launched last year. He claimed Reliance Trendz is the largest apparel seller in India while the ubiquitous Reliance Digital has become the largest retailer of electronics and digital products in India.  He also spoke about leveraging Jio&rsquo;s success to help grow Reliance&rsquo;s retail business. The Bharat-India Jodo programme is expected to integrate Reliance Retail with Reliance Jio. Ambani said, &ldquo;We see the maximum scope in creating a unique online-to-offline platform. This will be done by combining the resources of Reliance Retail and Jio's digital infrastructure.&rdquo;  He also added that Jio has enabled the company reinvent itself as a tech platform. These, he said, have become new age factories. The hybrid model, it is claimed, will offer value for money to consumers and integrate pharmacies, small groceries etc.  Moving to the entertainment sector, Mr Ambani said Reliance Industries now runs one of the country&rsquo;s largest media and entertainment networks - One in five internet users in India are on Network18's websites and one in two people watch its TV channels.. He added that it is the partner of choice for any foreign media company operating in India.&nbsp; Ambani also said digital tools will predict and anticipate customer needs.  Speaking about RIL&rsquo;s hydrocarbon and refinery businesses, the chairman said the group has commissioned the largest paraxylene complex in the world with a capacity of 4.2 million metric tonnes. Reliance is the second largest paraxylene producer in the world and Jamnagar in Gujarat is its largest facility. Speaking about the year ahead, Ambani said RIL is committed to becoming one of the largest recyclers of plastic and polymers, for instance PET bottles.  Another big move the RIL is looking at is the commissioning of the world's largest coke gasification project. This is geared towards eliminating its dependence on imported natural gas. He also spoke about the RIL-BP joint venture seeking opportunities to market gas in India. The company has set itself a target to begin gas production by 2020 and reach full production of 30-35 MMSCMD gas production in India by 2022.  The impact of Reliance&rsquo;s 41st AGM remains to be seen. But, as of now, Bloomberg reports that shares of the company erased gains and fell 0.98 percent to Rs 980.40 after the shareholders' meet ended.

Most analysts&rsquo; feel the same way about the stock price as well, which rose a little over 7 percent in 2018.  As the Golden Decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses, Mukesh Ambani said addressing the shareholders.  Reliance continues to be India's largest exporter accounting for 8.9 percent of India's total merchandise exports with a value of Rs 176,117 crore with access to markets in 113 countries.  The speech has something for everyone. The big takeaway is that most of the business of RIL are contributing to its growth story and plans to foray into e-commerce business in agriculture, education, and healthcare.  The big announcement of advanced fiber-based broadband connectivity service called JioGigaFibre sent shivers in the telecom as well as Cable TV space. Mukesh Ambani says the new fibre service will redefine 24/7 emergency help for all homes across India.  The stock has risen a little over 7 percent in 2018 but analysts&rsquo; feel that there is plenty of growth left for the long-term investors. Although it may remain in a range in the next 12 months or so.  &amp;quot;RIL's profits are up by 20.6 percent to Rs 36,075.crore in FY18. Reliance has reached an inflection point,&amp;quot; Ambani said addressing shareholders at the 41st AGM. He added that Reliance Jio and Retail's share in overall EBITDA has gone up from 2 percent earlier to 13 percent now.  Jio has doubled its customer base to 215 million users within 22 months since the official launch of the network which is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world.  &ldquo;RIL provided a detailed presentation on Jio citing its vision for Jio over the next few years. Significant growth in subscriber base to 215mn and robust jump in data and voice usage are commendable,&rdquo; Sudeep Anand, Head-Institutional Equity Research at IDBI Capital told Moneycontrol.  &ldquo;The company&rsquo;s strategy to go aggressive on FTH (Fibre-to-home) business along with connecting enterprise business are likely to drive growth for the company. The company is targeting 100 mn Reliance Jio phone users, 5mn FTH subscribers and 50mn households with broadband and other services,&rdquo; he said.  Also, Reliance disclosed its plan for e-commerce business in 3 main platforms 1) agriculture, 2) education and 3) healthcare. Though it provides a positive outlook but difficult to pen any numbers as of now, but Anand is quite optimistic about the future of Jio and RIL as a whole. IDBI Capital maintains a buy rating with a target price of Rs1,150.  In the last one year, Jio has achieved unprecedented growth starting with an already existing large base. The data usage has grown from 125 crore GBs per month to more than 240 crore GBs per month.  Jio is the world's largest mobile data network last year and the gap from the others has only widened in the last 12 months. The voice usage on the network has grown from 250 crore minutes per day to more than 530 crore minutes per day.  RIL plans to foray into three new platforms vis. Agriculture, education, as well as healthcare. Mukesh Ambani further added that as India starts on its high growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period.  &ldquo;Launch of Jio was just a trailer, the array of services which Reliance now wants to deliver/cross-sell to the last mile consumers are huge and varied across many sectors which hitherto are serviced by brick and motor establishments,&rdquo; says Jimeet Modi, Founder &amp;amp;amp; CEO, SAMCO Securities &amp;amp;amp; StockNote who has a target of Rs 1050-900 on RIL for next 12 months.  &ldquo;These will now be catered through Jio&rsquo;s digital platform. The philosophy of forwarding integration in data is the next mission of Jio. This will truly bring in digital revolution if they are able to implement and execute the same,&rdquo; he said.  Reliance started with backward integration in Refinery by later venturing into hydro carbon sector, but in digital it is the reverse.  Hydrocarbon Business:  RIL has successfully commissioned and stabilized the world's largest Paraxylene complex. Reliance is the second largest PX producer in the world and Jamnagar has the distinction of being the largest manufacturing facility of PX in the world with 4.2 million MT of capacity.  Speaking at the AGM, Mukesh Ambani said that we commissioned the largest off-Gas cracker complex in the world. Using our Refinery off-gasses as feedstock, this cracker is the most cost competitive ethylene cracker, globally.  &ldquo;This positions us uniquely, as one of the most efficient producers of Polymers in the world. I am proud to report that both these projects have been completed in a record time frame, at world-beating capital productivity and commissioned flawlessly,&rdquo; he said. &amp;quot;Both the Paraxylene and Cracker complexes are already running substantially higher than their design capacity.&amp;quot;  &ldquo;The core downstream projects are largely on track with Paraxylene and RoGC already running above the design capacity and petcoke gasification project now fully stabilized. We have Buy rating on Reliance Industries,&rdquo; Abhijeet Bora, analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

He was addressing the company&rsquo;s shareholders at its 41st Annual General Meeting.  The oil-to-telecom conglomerate posted consolidated revenues of Rs 430,731 crore in 2017-18 and a profit after tax of Rs 36,075 crore.  &ldquo;As India starts on its high growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period. And the creation of societal value by Reliance will be of an even higher order,&rdquo; Ambani said in his over-an-hour-long speech at the Birla Matoshri Sabhaghar in Mumbai.  Key takeaways from CMD Mukesh Ambani's speech  The contribution of RIL&rsquo;s consumer businesses of retail and mobility rose to 13 percent at the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) level, up from 2 percent in merely a year.  The company is banking on telecom, retail and the online-to-offline new commerce platform to achieve its target of doubling revenues in 8 years.  Addressing his shareholders, Ambani laid out a vision for the company which he said would transition to become a technology platform company.  He said the company would ride on technology to also spearhead initiatives in agriculture, education and health, the three key sectors that he had also mentioned in his last AGM speech.&nbsp; Ambani said the company would create more such platforms to create societal value.  RIL AGM Highlights: Looking to shift from a cyclical to annuity business, says Mukesh Ambani  &ldquo;Our digital connectivity platform has served as the foundation on which we are building our new commerce platform, our media and entertainment platform, education platform, healthcare platform and agriculture platform. Going forward, we shall build more such platforms,&rdquo; he said.  Ambani also reaffirmed the group&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the environment. He said environment regulation is now a global imperative, a fact reflected in the company being the largest recycler of PET in India. The company recycles over 2 billion PET bottles annually.  &ldquo;We are committed to becoming a leader in the emerging circular economy and to become one of the largest recyclers of plastics in India. All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business,&rdquo; Ambani said.  JIO DIGITAL  A major part of Ambani&rsquo;s speech was devoted to Reliance Jio. The RIL Chairman said the company would continue to increase the affordability of its digital network for the common man.  After disrupting the mobile call and data market in less than 22 months, Ambani said the company is now set to cause ripples in the fixed-line broadband market. The RIL Chairman said he aims to put India among the five largest consumers of fixed-line broadband services.  Full text of&nbsp;speech&nbsp;by Mukesh Ambani  The company has been credited with making India the largest consumer of mobile data services in the world in 2017, jumping from 150th rank in less than a year.&nbsp; Reliance Jio now has 225 million users, a feat achieved within 22 months of its launch.  RIL is looking to increasingly become a part of everyday life. The company also announced that it will launch Jio Smart Home Accessories like sensors to detect and regulate water leak, temperature, lighting, electrical appliances.  INDEPENDENCE DAY LAUNCHES  Ambani said the company will start taking bookings for its much-awaited fixed line broadband &lsquo;JioGigaFiber&rsquo; services from August 15. People can register for the services via Jio.com and MyJio app. The service will not just bring high-speed broadband services but also will enable homes to become smart, allowing devices to communicate with each other.  The company will roll out JioGigaFiber services in 1,100 cities simultaneously with the number of registrations deciding the priority of launch in a given city, Ambani said. The company is targeting 5 crore JioGigaHomes in the first phase.  He said the company does not need to make fresh investments in its soon-to-be-launched JioGigaFiber services, having already invested Rs 250,000 crore to create a world-class digital infrastructure that spans 4G LTE and optic fiber network for mobility and fixed-line broadband businesses.  After announcing the launch of JioGigaFiber, Ambani stepped aside for a while to let his daughter Isha, son Akash and Reliance Jio Director Kiran Thomas address the audience. Isha said the three most popular apps &ndash; Whatsapp, YouTube and Facebook &ndash; will be available on JioPhone from August 15.

NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM  Ambani also spoke passionately about creating a hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform.  &ldquo;We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio's digital infrastructure and services,&rdquo; Ambani said.  The platform will bring together the 35 crore customer footfalls at Reliance Retail stores, the 21.5 crore Jio users, the targeted 5 crore Jio Giga Homes and the 3 crore small merchants and shop-keepers all over India who provide the last-mile physical market connectivity.  &ldquo;Hence, we will integrate the physical and digital marketplaces in a uniquely collaborative Bharat-India jodo enterprise,&rdquo; the RIL CMD said.

RIL Chairman&nbsp;and Managing Director (MD) Mukesh Ambani said the service would benefit homes, merchants and small businesses.  Speaking the AGM, Ambani said the service will provide ultra-high definition entertainment on TV, voice activated assistance, virtual reality gaming and digital shopping as well as smart home solutions.  Ambani said the service was currently in the beta trial stage in &ldquo;tens of thousands&rdquo; of homes.

JioGigaFiber would help small businesses get access to powerful cloud applications, Ambani said, adding that the service will be of &ldquo;vital national importance&rdquo; help in the growth of the Indian economy.  &ldquo;This will redefine 24x7 emergency help for all homes across India,&rdquo; Ambani said.  Akash Ambani, director of Reliance Jio said Jio would install the JioGigaFiber router at customers&rsquo; residences and will connect the JioGigaTV set-top box to the television. The installation will be completed within one hour.  &ldquo;Your home will have wall-to-wall Wi-Fi coverage, every appliance, plug point, switch will become smart. You can have cameras giving you 24x7 security monitoring, alerts,&rdquo; Akash Ambani said.    Jio, the company's telecom service, will move India to top five nations in fixed line broadband in coming year, Ambani said.  Its launch in September 2016 has made India the highest mobile data consuming nation.  While the price structure for the fixed-line broadband has not been announced, reports had earlier suggested the telecom company may offer internet access, videos and voice calls for less than Rs 1,000&nbsp;per month.  Jio had begun rolling out beta trials of the Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) services at&nbsp;select locations in six cities &mdash; Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Ahmedabad, Jamnagar, Surat and Vadodara in May 2017.  The FTTH services are expected to offer download speeds of at least 100 Mbps at affordable rates.  In&nbsp;other announcements, the company also launched JioPhone 2 at an introductory price of Rs 2,999 and said that the existing JioPhone model will continue to be available.  Besides,&nbsp;Ambani announced the launch of JioGiga router, Jio smart home solutions and JioGigaTV set top box.

The AGM will begin at 11 am&nbsp;at Birla Matushri Sabhagar, 19, Sir Vithaldas Thackersey Marg, near Bombay Hospital&nbsp;and&nbsp;Medical Research Centre, in Mumbai.  For the last few years, RIL has made massive Jio-related announcements during the AGM and the trend is expected to continue. Not to forget, the highly-anticipated JioPhone was launched at the same event last year, which was made available for a refundable deposit of Rs 1,500.  Reports suggest that RIL could well announce the commercial launch and prices for its broadband venture, JioFiber service.  So what is JioFiber and how is it different from other broadband connections?  JioFiber is the latest offering from Jio for your home.

Highlights from March quarter results:  Reliance Industries reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore for the March quarter, up 17 percent compared to the same quarter of the previous year.  Consolidated quarterly revenues stood at Rs 1.29 lakh crore, up 39 percent quarter on quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 5 percent, QoQ, to Rs 18,469 crore, and the operating margin was 15.8 percent.  Jio has continued its strong subscriber growth trend with net addition during the quarter of 26.5 mn and its total count reached to 186 million. Higher competition has capped ARPU to Rs 137 which resulted in lower revenue of Rs 8,421 crore.  Most brokerages have highlighted that the results have largely been in line with estimates, but have raised target prices up to Rs 1,200.

The owner of world's largest oil refining complex will also make low-cost and high-volume composite products like modular toilets, homes and composites for windmill blades and rotor blades.  Without giving investment details, Reliance in its latest annual report said it has developed capabilities for 3D printing of wide-range of plastic and metals products.  Reliance is developing new business verticals in the petrochemicals business to capture Rs 30,000 crore composites market and has plans to produce graphene, enhanced plastics and elastomers, fiber reinforced composites which can replace steel.  A composite is an engineered material made from two or more ingredients with significantly differing properties, either physical or chemical. One of the most common forms of composite in use today is carbon fiber.  It is made by heating lengths of rayon, pitch or other types of fiber to extremely high temperatures in an oxygen-deprived oven. The resultant rayon strands are spun into a thread, then woven into sheets and mixed with hardening resins to form the various components needed.  &amp;quot;RIL is investing in India's first and largest carbon fiber production line with its own technology &ndash; to cater to India's aerospace and defence needs as well as the specialty industrial applications,&amp;quot; it said.  It had last year acquired the assets of Kemrock Industries to enter the composites business and is focusing on thermoset composites such as glass and carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRPs).  &amp;quot;The ability to deliver exceptional strength (similar to or better than steel) at a significantly lower weight is a critical performance attribute of FRPs. Additionally, FRPs can withstand harsh weather, have a long life with minimal maintenance, are corrosion resistant and can be moulded into any shape,&amp;quot; it said.  Composites are used in a wide range of markets and applications: industrial, railways, renewable energy, defence and aerospace.  &amp;quot;RIL expects the newly launched Reliance Composites Solutions (RCS) business to be the No. 1 composites player in India,&amp;quot; the company said.  Stating that it will focus on design and specifications driven markets and applications that have the potential to grant better returns, it said the focus areas include wind mill blades and parts for railways and metros, which have exacting standards of performance and safety (especially fire retardant).  Also on the radar are carbon wraps to rehabilitate/refurbish India's old infrastructure &ndash; bridges, buildings (for improved seismic performance) and pipes.  &amp;quot;RCS will design and administer low-cost and high-volume products such as modular toilets and homes to support the Swachh Bharat Mission, disaster relief measures and Housing for All programmes initiated by the Indian Government,&amp;quot; the annual report said.

Reliance's move, expected to take effect in October or November, came after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement this month and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran.  Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day &amp;quot;wind-down&amp;quot; period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day &amp;quot;wind-down period&amp;quot; ending on Nov. 4.  India has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions but companies with links to the U.S. financial system could be liable to penalties if they do not comply.  Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others.  Reliance, whose modern refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, has told officials of the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) that the firm would stop oil imports from Tehran in October or November, one of the sources said.  A second source said the company could halt imports from Iran earlier than that if European nations and Tehran failed to salvage the nuclear deal.  This source said that some insurance companies have asked Reliance to end exposure to Iran before November.  Global insurers have already warned about doing business with Iran while some shipping lines have said they would not take new bookings for Iran.  The United States has threatened to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran.  In the interim period until it stops buying Iranian oil, Reliance has asked NIOC to supply Iranian oil in vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), the sources said.  The sources did not wish to be identified as the matter is sensitive. Reliance did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.  In 2017, Reliance's oil imports from Iran surged by about 45 percent to 67,000 bpd, according to ship tracking data. In Jan-April 2018, the company has imported about 96,000 bpd.  RETHINKING DEALINGS  Washington's withdrawal from the nuclear deal has spurred global insurers and other companies to rethink their dealings in Iran as they await further guidance from the United States and European Union.  Earlier this month French energy giant Total said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions.  Italy's Eni, which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, has said it had no plans for new projects in Iran.  Reliance, which deals with some of the top-notch foreign bankers with huge exposure to the U.S. financial system, exports fuel to the United States and imports ethane from there for its petrochemical plants.  Trade sources have said Reliance recently bought up to 8 million barrels of U.S. crude.  After a gap of six years, Reliance resumed purchases from Iran in 2016 when Western powers eased restrictions on trade with Iran in return for the OPEC member agreeing to end its disputed nuclear programme.  During previous sanctions NIOC waived a condition for its oil buyers to open letters of credit.  Since the lifting of sanctions, it has been selling oil in euros, a move that has allowed companies to temporarily continue dealing with Iran, despite the U.S. move to reimpose sanctions.  Iran is also offering deep discounts on sales to recoup market share in Asia, lost to key rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq.  The company's global depository receipts are traded in the U.S. market. It is also the first Asian company to float 50- and 100-year bonds on the U.S. debt market, according to its annual report.

The approval, given based on the recommendations of an expert panel, is subject to compliance of certain conditions, the official said.  The proposal is to expand the gas cracker and downstream plants located at Nagothane village in Raigad district by way of debottlenecking, expansion and change of fuel in captive power plant (CPP) along with expansion and rebuilding of residential township.  The cost of the proposed project, expected to be commissioned in stages, is estimated to be Rs 2,338 crore, the official added. As per the proposal, no additional land and manpower is required for the proposed project.  It has 744 hectare land and 1,794 manpower at present. The company manufactures wide range of products such as Ethylene Oxide, Ethylene Glycol, Linear Low Density High Density Polyethylene (LLHDPE), Hexene-1 and others along with a gas-based CPP.  Presently, RIL Nagothane uses a mixture of ethane and propane to produce downstream products and by-products. The proposal is to modify its feedstock ratio in its gas cracker plant owing to availability of imported shale gas ethane.  With the proposed change in feedstock mixture resulting in higher production of ethylene, the company wants to expand the capacities of downstream products/by-products to accommodate the increased ethyelene production.  That apart, the company has proposed to enhance CPP capacity from 85 mw to 100 mw by way of refurbishing and also use ethane as a fuel owing to its economic viability and availability. Further, the proposed project also includes expansion of the existing township with additional residential apartments within the township area.

We believe the company is strongly placed after the aggressive capex done by it.  Most of its projects have started delivering which would give a boost to its cash flow boost in upcoming years along with improved return ratios. We would look it as a long-term India story of diversification rather than watching its results on&nbsp;QoQ basis.  We like the performance shown by the company in FY18 and especially petchem segment and JIO operations. In a short span of time, the company has gained 45 percent subs market share in mobile broadband segment. Jio, which with 186.6 million subscribers is the world's largest and fastest growing mobile data network, saw profits rise to Rs 510 crore, up 1.2 percent over third quarter earnings.  Though Jio started operations in September 2016 with free voice and data offering, 2017-18 was first full year of its financial reporting. Despite low-cost mobile services, Jio posted the highest average revenue per user in the industry at Rs 137.1 per month during the reported quarter.  Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Airtel reported average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 116 for the quarter, down by 26.7 percent from Rs 158 it had registered a year ago. We believe, Jio will play a crucial role in earnings growth.  In Q4FY18, the company&rsquo;s revenue stood at Rs 129120 crore, an increase of 39 percent compared to Rs 92889 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Exports (including deemed exports) from India during the January-March 2018 quarter were higher by 32.5 percent at Rs 51295&nbsp;crore (USD 7.9 billion) as against Rs 8718&nbsp;crore in the corresponding period of the previous year due to higher volumes and product prices in refining and petrochemical business.  Increase in consolidated revenue was primarily on account of volume increase with starting up of petrochemicals projects and oil price-related increase in realisations for refining and petrochemical products.  Higher interest and depreciation charges with the commissioning of projects across businesses, however, resulted in relatively lower growth in profit after tax (PAT). The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9435 billion for the quarter ending March 31 (Q4) on the back of improved performance of its petrochemical and retail businesses.  The profit was largely in line with street estimates and represents a 17.3 percent increase over Rs 8046 billion reported in the year ago quarter. Earnings from the refining and marketing business took a hit, with a 10.9 percent year-on-year decline in its earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) for the March 2018 quarter.  The company said, the fall was largely on account of reduced crude throughput and adverse move in Brent-Dubai crude oil price differentials.  The company&rsquo;s petrochemical segment witnessed robust performance which improved overall profitability. Petchem business registered a topline growth of 13 percent led by a mix of higher prices for products along with higher volumes especially in paraxylene and ROGC (refinery of gas cracker). EBIT growth of 12 percent was driven by strong margins from polypropylene, PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and downstream polyester products. With the full commissioning of the refinery off cracker plant, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business which is already posting good growth.  Reliance Jio Infocom reported its second quarterly net profit at Rs 510 crore, marginally up from the preceding quarter ended December when the telecommunications subsidiary showed a profit for the first time at Rs 504 crore. For 2017-18, the Jio operations reported a PAT Rs 723&nbsp;crore against a loss of Rs 3.1 crore in 2016-17.  RIL&rsquo;s gross refining margin (GRM) was down marginally at USD 11 a barrel for the quarter from USD 11.6 in the previous quarter.  For the full year of 2017-18, RIL recorded consolidated revenue of Rs 4,30731 crore, an increase of 30.5 percent, compared to Rs 3,30180&nbsp;crore in the previous year.  The company&rsquo;s topline was also boosted by robust growth in the retail and digital services businesses. Robust growth of 134 percent in its retail business and continuing growth momentum in wireless subscriber additions for digital services business supported its topline. The company&rsquo;s plans to further expand its consumer retail presence in every format which would further drive profitability in the coming years.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, RIL, said, &ldquo;The year (2017-18) was a landmark year for Reliance, where we established several records on both operating and financial parameters. Reliance has become the first Indian company to record PBDIT (profit before depreciation, interest and tax) of over $10 billion with each of our key businesses &mdash; refining, petrochemicals, retail and digital services achieving record earnings performance. Substantial synergies, productivity gains and production growth in our energy and materials business have allowed us to perform at very competitive levels despite the uptrend in oil prices through the year.&rdquo;  Increase in petroleum product prices were led by 18 percent year-on-year increase in brent oil price to USD 57.5 a barrel. The company also announced that it plans to shut oil and gas production at its main fields in KG-D6 block in the coming months and begin complying with the government&rsquo;s guidelines for decommissioning facilities in the Bay of Bengal block where output has hit its lowest ever.

Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,180  The global research firm said that petchem business had a robust performance in Q4.

The strong overall performance was largely driven by traction in the petrochemicals, digital, and retail segments. While we expected a healthy performance from petrochemicals (petchem) and digital segments, what came as a surprise was the phenomenal topline and profit growth from retail. Jio continued to post a good set of numbers and posted a positive EBITDA and profit after tax in the quarter ended March.  Overall revenue grew almost 30 percent year-on-year (YoY )along with a 51 percent YoY uptick in earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and a 1700 basis points (bps) margin expansion. Net profit growth was a tad slow at 17 percent mostly due to higher interest and depreciation costs with most major projects coming on stream.    Segment wise performance &ndash;      Petrochemicals &ndash; volumes and price drive growth  In line with expectations, the petrochemical segment reported a robust performance, helping drive overall profitability. A strong 13-percent topline growth in the petrochemical business was driven by a mix of higher prices for products along with higher volumes especially in paraxylene and ROGC (refinery of gas cracker).&nbsp; EBIT growth of 12 percent was driven by strong margins from polypropylene, PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and downstream polyester products.  Also Read: Top 10 takeaways from Reliance Industries' Q4 results&nbsp;  While the fiscal had started on a slow note, Q2FY18 saw strong traction driven by high growth in the polymer and polyester demand which helped the company touch its highest-ever production levels. With all major projects now fully commissioned, the upcoming year is expected to witness strong growth with high volumes and management has guided to stability&nbsp;in margins.    Though substantially outperforming the benchmark Singapore GRM of USD 7 per billion barrel (bbl), the GRM at USD 11 per bbl remained slightly below expectation. Higher crude prices facilitated the 30 percent increase in the&nbsp;top line,&nbsp;however, the adverse move in Brent-Dubai differentials and reduced crude throughput led to a decline in the segment EBIT. Volumes grew almost 42 percent in the 1,313 fuel outlets across the country.  Oil demand grew on the back of global demand upswing led largely by the aviation, gasoline and diesel verticals. Domestic demand remained close to 1.6 million barrels (mbl) per day during FY18, much above the expected levels of 1.3 mbl. In FY19, demand is expected to stay steady around 1.5 mbl, which would facilitate growth in the segment and improve margins.  Organized retail &ndash; a positive surprise  The results from the organized retail segment came as a positive surprise with a phenomenal 134 percent topline growth during the quarter along with almost a 300 percent growth in EBIT led by expanding scale, and operational efficiencies. Volumes grew across consumer baskets and traction in this segment marks the overall expanding presence of the company&rsquo;s consumer portfolio. RIL plans to further expand its consumer retail presence in every format which would further drive profitability in the coming years. Strong traction in this high-margin business will be worth watching out for.  Upstream Oil segment &ndash; less erosion with high crude prices  Upstream performance remained near flattish with an overall decline in production. The crude oil price continued its upward trend in 4QFY18, up 24 percent YoY, which helped to make up for a portion of the loss. Ramping up of the CBM operation and the commencement of the upstream gas production would be some key developments in the future.  Jio &ndash; keeping strong  Jio reported revenue from operations of Rs 7,128 crores (up 3.6 percent quarter on quarter) and added 26.5 million net subscribers over the last quarter, bringing the subscriber base to 186.6 million at the end of March 2017.  The company continued to follow its strategy of capturing subscriber base aggressively even if it meant lower ARPU (average revenue per user). The strategy resulted in a strong sequential growth of 16.6 percent in its net subscriber base whereas its ARPU declined by 11 percent and stood at Rs 137.1 per month, still much better than what Bharti Airtel, the market leader, reported (Rs 116).    In terms of operating margin, Jio reported a minor contraction of 40bps in its EBITDA margin, which came at 37.8 percent, respectable nevertheless. The contraction was primarily due to the&nbsp;reduction in tariff to maintain the price difference with the incumbents. This got partially offset by the reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 15.7 percent of revenues from operations to 15.0 percent in this quarter (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) reduced interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).  What next?  After the end of an aggressive capex cycle, RIL now stands at a sweet spot where most of its projects have started delivering. The company is likely to see a big cash flow boost in upcoming years along with enhanced operating efficiencies and an uptick in the return ratios. The overall macro environment also stands quite conducive to the various verticals where the company has exposure.  With the full commissioning of the refinery off cracker plant, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business which is already posting good growth.  We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of significant capacity, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India.

The consolidated net profit rose by 17.3 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 9,459 crore or $1.14 billion which was almost similar to a CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 9,498 crore.  The stock which rose to a record high ahead of the results closed 2.1 percent higher to Rs 996.30. It hit a record high of 1011 and a low of 985.50. The stock rose nearly 6 percent so far in the year 2018 and by about 39 percent in the last one year.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman, and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said: &ldquo;FY 2017-18 was a landmark year for Reliance where we established several records on both operating and financial parameters. Reliance has become the first Indian company to record PBDIT of over US$ 10 billion with each of our key businesses - Refining, Petrochemicals, Retail and Digital Services achieving record earnings performance.  &amp;quot;Substantial synergies, productivity gains and production growth in our energy and materials business have allowed us to perform at very competitive levels despite the uptrend in oil prices through the year,&amp;quot; he said.  We have collated a list of top 10 takeaways from RIL Q4 results:  Total revenue:  RIL achieved revenue of Rs 129,120 crore ($ 19.8 billion), an increase of 39 percent as compared to Rs 92,889 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Increase in revenue is primarily on account of volume increase with the start-up of petrochemicals projects and oil price related increase in realizations for refining and petrochemical products.  The increase in consolidated revenues reflects the robust growth of 134% in Retail business and continuing growth momentum in wireless subscriber additions for Digital Services business.  Operating Profit:  Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 51 percent to Rs18,469 crore ($ 2.8billion) from Rs12,233 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  The strong operating performance was driven by growth in Petrochemicals, Retail, and Digital Services businesses. This was partially offset by the reduced contribution from refining due to lower crude throughput, and lower volumes in upstream oil &amp;amp;amp; gas.  Outstanding Debt:  Outstanding debt as on 31st March 2018 was Rs218,763 crore ($ 33.6 billion) compared to Rs196,601 crore as on 31st March 2017.  Reliance Jio:  Jio has continued its strong subscriber growth trend with net addition during the quarter of 26.5 million (as against 21.5 million in the previous quarter). The standalone revenue from operations stood at Rs7,128 crore, which translates into a growth of 3.6 percent on a QoQ basis. The standalone net profit of Rs510 crore.  Organized Retail Business:  Revenue for 4Q FY18 grew by 134.1 percent on a YoY basis to Rs24,183 crore from Rs10,332 crore. Reliance Retail witnessed stellar performance across all consumption baskets during the period.  The business delivered strong PBDIT of Rs1,086 crore in 4Q FY18 as against Rs352 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. During the quarter, Reliance Retail added 86 stores across various store concepts and strengthened its distribution network for consumer electronics.  Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing Business:  Revenue from the Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing segment for 4Q FY18 increased by 29.8 percent on a YoY basis to Rs93,519 crore led by 24.2 percent YoY higher crude oil prices during the quarter.  Segment EBIT declined by 10.9 percent on a YoY basis to Rs5,607 crore ($ 860 million), largely on account of reduced crude throughput and adverse move in Brent-Dubai differentials.  Gross Refining Margins (GRMs):  GRM, a gauge for regional refining margins for the year was at a 9-year high of $11.6/bbl as against $11/bbl in the previous year. GRM is the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products  RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by $4.4/bbl. As at the end of the year, RIL operated 1,313 petroleum retail outlets in the country.  Petrochemicals Business  Revenue from the Petrochemicals segment in 4Q FY18 increased by 43.9 percent on a YoY basis to Rs38,113 crore due to higher volumes and prices. Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level of Rs6,435 crore supported by strong volume growth, higher margins for Polypropylene, downstream polyester products and fibre intermediate products.  This was partially offset by lower deltas in elastomers and Polyethylene. Volume growth was led by successful stabilization of the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC and its downstream units.  Oil and Gas (Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production) Business:  Revenue for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment for 4Q FY18 decreased by 43 percent on a YoY basis to a Rs746 crore. Segment EBIT was at (600) crore as against (486) crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  The segment performance continues to be impacted by declining volumes. Domestic production was lower at 18.4 Bcfe, down 17.5 percent on a YoY basis whereas production in US Shale operations declined by 13.6% to 32.4 Bcfe.  KG-D6:  KG-D6 field produced 0.167 million barrels of crude oil and 13.7 BCF of natural gas in 4Q FY18, both were lower by 41 percent on a year-on-year basis. Fall in oil and gas production was mainly on account of natural decline coupled with underperformance and shutdown of wells due to water and sand ingress.

The company&nbsp;&nbsp;is expected to report a net profit of Rs 9,635.2 crore for the March quarter, an increase of 2.25 percent quarter-on-quarter and 19.8 percent year-on-year, according to average of estimates of analysts polled by Reuters.  Reliance, India's second largest company by market capitalisation, will&nbsp;&nbsp;report its fourth quarter earnings&nbsp; on April 27.  Apart from petrochemical and refinery businesses, the telecom segment is closely watched by the Street. The telecom segment had posted a profit in the December quarter.  Ahead of earnings Thursday, the stock price closed half a percent higher at Rs 975.35 amid high volumes. The shares shed 4 percent in the last quarter of FY18 after a 17 percent rally in the preceding quarter and a 34 percent rally in the whole of FY18.  The Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani Group company is also going to consider and recommend dividend on equity shares on Friday.  Here are&nbsp;the key factors to watch out for in its earnings:  Reuters Poll  Profit after tax for the quarter is expected at Rs 9,635.2 crore, an increase of 2.25 percent quarter-on-quarter and 19.8 percent year-on-year. Operating income is seen rising 2.6 percent QoQ and 38.2 percent YoY to Rs 18,043.6 crore.  Petrochemical Business  Petrochemical business, which contributed 24 percent to gross revenue and reported 20.5 percent sequential growth in Q3 (more than 47 percent growth YoY), is likely to continue to perform strong in the March quarter as well due to capacity expansion and higher volumes, analysts said.  &amp;quot;Petchem segment is expected to do better due to healthy deltas and strong volume growth in the segment,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said in a report. Broker KR Choksey also expects the petchem segment to perform well owing to improved margins supported by a strong volume growth in production at 8.1 MMT (up 30.6 percent YoY, 1.3 percent QoQ).  Edelweiss Securities said petchem earnings are likely to improve 11 percent as new capacities ramp up in addition to robust cracker and polymer margins. It expects continued benefit from US ethane imports and off-gas projects.  Petchem revenue stood at Rs 33,726 crore in the December quarter against Rs 27,999 crore in September quarter, with EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) growth of 16 percent QoQ (up 73 percent YoY) at Rs 5,753 crore in Q3FY18.  &amp;quot;Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level supported by strong volume growth, higher margins for Polypropylene and downstream polyester products. The volume growth was led by the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC coming on-stream along with downstream LDPE, LLDPE and MEG plants,&amp;quot; RIL had said in its filing.  Refinery Business  Gross refining margin (GRM) is another key point to watch out for in the March quarter.  &amp;quot;Singapore complex GRM stood at USD 7 a barrel in Q4FY18 versus USD 7.3 a barrel in Q3FY18 and USD 6.4 in Q4FY17. We expect marginal inventory gain during the quarter. Average Brent crude price was up 24 percent YoY and 9 percent QoQ to USD 67 a barrel,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said while expecting the Reliance to clock GRM of USD 11.4 a barrel, led by strong benchmark (premium of USD 4.4 a barrel).  Analysts have&nbsp;factored a GRM in the range of USD 11 to USD 11.6 a barrel in their expectations. KR Choksey's estimate of USD 13.7 dollar is an outlier.&nbsp;The broker has&nbsp;a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,600 per share.  Gross refining margin was USD 11.6 a barrel in December quarter 2017 against USD 12 a barrel in September quarter and USD 10.8 a barrel in December quarter 2016.  Refining business, which contributed more than 50 percent to total revenue, grew by 8.7 percent QoQ and 23 percent YoY to Rs 75,865 crore in December quarter with EBIT falling 6.9 percent QoQ and 0.5 percent YoY.  Telecom  Analysts will also be closely watching the performance of the telecom arm Jio, after the business reported its first ever quarterly profit within six months of starting commercial operations. Segment profit stood at Rs 504 crore in the December quarter against loss of Rs 271 crore in September quarter.  Reliance Jio added around 190 million subscribers in March quarter against 160 million in December quarter.  Motilal Oswal said positive developments in the telecom business would drive growth further for the company and core segment performance is expected to be strong going forward.  Operating revenue of its telecom business increased 11.9 percent sequentially to Rs 6,879 crore with EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 82.1 percent at Rs 2,628 crore and with margin improvement of 1,470 basis points at 38.2 percent in Q3FY18. Its EBIT grew by 453.1 percent QoQ to Rs 1,436 crore.  Other Factors  Also of interest will the retail business, which contributed 13 percent to gross revenue. This segment it had reported 28.3 percent sequential growth (up 116.4 YoY) in revenue in December quarter with EBIT growing 45.8 percent QoQ and 110.8 percent YoY.  &amp;quot;Retail business is also doing well with high double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA,&amp;quot; Sharekhan said.  Overall the performance of shale gas business (that had reported loss in December quarter), petchem margins, progress on remaining core expansions and update on telecom business will&nbsp; be monitored by the Street.

The research body has done a deep study of the socio-economic impact of the Reliance Industries subsidiary. In its 34-page study, the agency points out how prior to Jio&rsquo;s entry in September 2016, the internet usage in India remained low even as its penetration rose.  Talking about the internet usage since 2000, the study says that while global internet traffic in peta bytes per month increased at an annual average growth rate of 30 per cent, the country&rsquo;s internet consumption lagged with a 21.7 per cent rise. But come Jio and all that changed as the company launched affordable data plans besides making voice free on its 4G LTE network.  &ldquo;It is a significant feat for a country that was ranked 155 in terms of mobile broadband penetration in 2015 to become the highest mobile broadband data consumer globally in 2017,&rdquo; the report says.  The escalation in data demand has mainly occurred because of an increase in its affordability. The price of 1 GB of data, which was Rs 375 in 2012 had merely halved to Rs 152 in 2016. But Jio&rsquo;s entry and enhanced levels of competition took prices down by 15 times to Rs 10 in 2017. The data implosion has been to the extent that India now uses 100 crore GB of data each month as compared to 20 crore GB earlier, the study reveals.  &ldquo;It can, thus, be said that Jio has reinvented and reimagined the entire telecom market with its innovative product offering,&rdquo; the Institute says commending the RIL unit.  The launch of the Rs 1,500 JioPhone last year has only accelerated the pace of increase in data usage as increased affordability brings internet to more people.  Institute for Competitiveness goes on to reveal a startling impact of Reliance Jio on the country&rsquo;s economy. It pegs the yearly savings of the entire economy due to a rise in affordability of data prices at a whopping $10 billion.  The study credits Jio&rsquo;s direct physical presence in all 29 states and partnerships with telecom infrastructure companies for its feat. The company&rsquo;s &ldquo;most sophisticated, efficient and largest LTE network&rdquo; covers more than 18,000 urban and rural towns and over 2,00,000 villages in the country.  The company has undertaken extensive research to build the network and filed 54 global patents over the course of this development.  &ldquo;Using the network, Jio aims to usher in an era of &ldquo;visuality&rdquo;, where video will replace voice as the new communication medium. Therefore, Jio has successfully boosted the productivity all across its value chain beginning with infrastructure development to product delivery to consumer usage itself,&rdquo; the research outfit says in its report.

BP India is expecting nearly 10 percent of BP's global earning to flow from India considering the growing energy demand and plans to&nbsp;invest in cutting-edge renewable and alternate energy technologies,&nbsp;Sashi Mukundan, BP Group&rsquo;s regional president and head of India told the paper. The firm's total earning in FY17 jumped more than double from the previous year to stand at USD 6.2 billion. The company has been investing in the Indian market. BP has invested more than USD 8 billion in India in the past seven years. Nearly 95 percent of its investment, or USD 7 billion, has been directed towards exploration and production. BP India is also working to boost&nbsp;its production along with its partner Reliance Industries (RIL) to produce 10 percent of India&rsquo;s total gas demand by 2022. The company partners RIL in four hydrocarbon blocks in the country which include &mdash; KG D6, R-Series, D55 and NEC 25, in the Mahanadi basin. &amp;quot;By 2022, we will have all three projects (KG D6, R-Series, D55 ) up and running and we should get to our peak production by 2023 with around 30-35 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd). That&rsquo;s a billion cubic feet of gas a day and if you look at the forecast for gas demand in India, that is about 10 percent of India&rsquo;s gas demand by 2022,&amp;quot; Mukundan said. India is the&nbsp;third largest energy consumer in the world after China and the US, however, the energy demand is likely to rise. With the economic expansion in the country, more people would gain access to power, cooking gas and personal transport that would push&nbsp;India&rsquo;s energy demand. To meet&nbsp;the increasing energy demand, India is planning to increase the proportion of gas usage in its energy mix to 15 percent from the current 6.5 percent. The world, on an average, consumes 24 percent of gas in the total energy consumption.  Both the firms &mdash; BP and RIL &mdash; will be starting natural gas production from the R-Series gas field in the KG-D6 block, where BP holds 33.33 percent stake, in Bay of Bengal by 2020. They are also planning to start&nbsp;gas production from other fields will start by 2021.

The current trend is largely due to the move we have seen in last week.  The positive close last week with a reversal pattern on weekly chart concluded the ground for short-term term bulls. The follow-up buying has now provided short-term term support with price action establishing itself above 200 days MA and this is the half battle done.

This was revealed by Ambani, the richest Indian, in his acceptance speech last night after his oil-to-telecom conglomerate, Reliance Industries was presented with the 'Drivers of Change' award at the Financial Times ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards.  Since the idea first cropped up, Reliance, which owns and operates the world's largest single location refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat, has spent more than USD 31 billion to break into India's mobile-phone market. The 2016 upstart, called Jio, dislodged rivals and has emerged as the nation's No. 4 carrier by offering call services free for life and data transmission at dirt cheap rates.  Jio is also gearing up for newer data-heavy services that can connect homes, businesses, and cars to the internet.  Ambani said with super-abundant youthful talent, India is poised to become the third largest economy in the world by 2028 -- within just a single decade.  &amp;quot;The idea of Jio was first seeded by my daughter, Isha, in 2011. She was a student at Yale (in the US) and was home for holidays. She wanted to submit some coursework &ndash; and she said, 'Dad, the internet in our house sucks',&amp;quot; he recalled.  Ambani said Isha's twin brother, Akash, at that time stated that in the old world, telecom was voice and people made money on calls but in the new world everything is digital.  &amp;quot;Isha and Akash belong to India's young generation that is far more creative, far more ambitious and far more impatient to become the best in the world. These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age and India cannot be left behind,&amp;quot; he said.  India at the time was suffering from poor connectivity and a severe scarcity of the most critical digital resource &ndash; data. Data was not only scarce, but it was priced artificially high to make it unaffordable to a majority of Indians, he said.  Jio transformed all of this by making data abundant and affordable and available in every part of the country.  &amp;quot;We launched Jio in September 2016. And today Jio has already become the biggest game changer in India,&amp;quot; he said.  Ambani said while the United States pioneered 1G mobile network, Europe ushered in 2G, and China leapfrogged with 3G, Jio has created the largest greenfield 4G LTE-only data network in the world.  &amp;quot;This will make India a leader in 4G in 2019,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It took the combined Indian telecom industry 25 years to build a pan-India 2G network. Jio took just three years to build a 4G LTE network, which is much larger and far more advanced. And it is also 5G-ready today.&amp;quot;  Jio has made voice-calling free for life and has also made high-quality data available at the lowest price in the world - at almost one-tenth the prices in the US, he said, and the firm acquired more than 100 million customers in just 170 days of launch.  This was more than one-and-a-half times the population of the United Kingdom.  For the 500 million Indians still using a feature phone and not a smartphone, Jio brought out the &amp;quot;world's most affordable 4G LTE smartphone&amp;quot; that is available for free for use with a deposit of Rs 1,500, he said. &amp;quot;The result has been stunning: 3 lakh to 5 lakh Indians are daily migrating to Jio Phone. And for the same Rs 200-300, they benefit through access to the high-speed internet with their existing voice needs are completely free.&amp;quot;  As the internet becomes accessible to all Indians, the country will be among the first to graduate to the Internet of Everything, he said.  &amp;quot;Within the next few years, Jio will empower the equivalent of two-thirds of Europe's population to enjoy world-class digital services in India,&amp;quot; he said, adding because of Jio, India has jumped from the rank of 155 to number one in the world in mobile broadband data consumption in less than two years.  &amp;quot;Jio has already grown to be the biggest start-up in India's history,&amp;quot; he said.  The previous honorees for the 'Drivers of Change' award include DeepMind Technologies (2016), FANUC (2015), HBO (2014), Alibaba (2013), MONDRAGON Corporation (2012), Amazon (2011), Apple (2010), Fiat (2009) and Ryanair (2008). RIL won it for its &amp;quot;exceptional commitment to innovation-led, exponential growth within the areas of hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and 4G digital services.&amp;quot;  Stating that his late father Dhirubhai Ambani was the original 'Driver of Change' in India's business history, he said the legendary industrialist founded Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 1966 with a meager capital of Rs 1,000 (about USD 130 at that time).  RIL, which today is an over USD 50 billion group, has doubled shareholder money every two-and-half years since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1977, he said. &amp;quot;During the same period, Reliance has contributed more to India's national wealth than any other business group.&amp;quot;  Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd."

Bezos, referred to as the &amp;quot;Centi-billionaire&amp;quot;, topped the list with a net worth of USD 112 billion, becoming the only person to appear in the Forbes list with a 12-figure fortune.  &amp;quot;Shares of his e-commerce giant Amazon rose 59 per cent in 12 months, helping boost his fortune by USD 39.2 billion. It was the biggest one year gain since Forbes started tracking billionaires in 1987,&amp;quot; it said.  The Amazon founder moved ahead of Bill Gates, who is now the second richest person globally with a fortune of USD 90 billion.  According to Forbes, India is home to 119 billionaires, 18 more than last year.  This year's list consists of 2,043 of the richest people in the world.

If somebody is interested in the options segment then 940 Call options can be shorted, because that is the highest call base placed near Rs 960, same&nbsp;as Nifty had the highest call base before at Rs 10,700 and it could not breach that level on this upside and then it finally came down.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;RIL was also the outperforming stock and that is reverting from the highest Call base of 960 and these positions are coming down now. So, it is better if somebody can short 940 Call which is still around Rs 11-13 and eventually I think if the stock remains under pressure or dips further down towards Rs 870, this premium will be off in this particular series. So, that is one opportunity that one have to play on the short side.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;From the midcap space, PVR is one stock which has remained under some selling pressure continuously. From the month of August 2017 we have seen that whenever it reaches Rs 1,400-1,450 levels there is some distribution happening near those levels and it finally starts coming down. The same pattern happened this time also. In fact what is more negative this time is the recent addition of short positions which have an average price of around Rs 1,380-1,370. So keeping stop loss there on upsides around Rs 1,300-1,310, one can go short in this stock. It is possible that the stock can dip towards Rs 1,200 in the coming days. So, there are some stock specific ideas where one can play shorts,&amp;quot; he added.

It also highlighted that potential to expand capacity will be key considerations for Tata. It sees debt rising to USD 17 billion in FY19.  Brokerage: Macquarie | Rating: Outperform  Macquarie said that it is calculating EV/EBITDA for Bhushan Steel At 6.3&ndash;7.6x FY19E Vs Tata At 7x. It estimates that the acquisition would increase Tata&rsquo;s net debt to 4.6 times FY19. Further, it believes that stock correction on headline bid value is making risk-reward attractive.  Reliance Industries  Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Underperform | Target: Rs 790  The global research firm said that average revenue per user (ARPU) may remain soft for now, while price competition could remain high in urban areas. Further, refining and olefin margins could soften in 2018-19. Going forward, higher gross refining margins and telecom revenues could be upside risks.  Steel  Brokerage: CLSA  CLSA said that valuations for Bhushan assets are above Tata&rsquo;s own expansion cost. Further, a favourable deal structure could still be a value creation. Inorganic expansion may not come as cheap as we initially envisaged. It remains positive on India&rsquo;s steel industry given tightening demand-supply."

The sharp recovery during current week&rsquo;s panic low of 10,300 indicates presence of buying support at lower levels.",,Stocks Views,https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/stocks-views/bargain-buys-ril-zee-entertainment-could-give-20-returnthe-next-6-months_10479661.html,"By Dharmesh Shah  ICICI Direct.com Research  The equity benchmarks witnessed profit booking since the start of February 2018 signalling pause in the recent uptrend after a rally of 12 percent during previous six weeks.  The index in the process maintained its tendency of taking a breather after rallying for five to seven weeks as seen since CY&rsquo;17. The subsequent corrective decline has typically lasted for two-three weeks.  In the present scenario, with almost two weeks of fall already in place, we expect supportive efforts to emerge near the key value area of 10300-10100 region.  Therefore, investors should utilise ongoing correction as an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks in a staggered manner. The sharp recovery during current week&rsquo;s panic low of 10,300 indicates presence of buying support at lower levels.  Going forward, we expect Nifty to hold the key support zone of 10100-10300 and lead a pullback towards 10,750-10,800 levels in February 2018 as it is the Confluence of 50% and 61.8% retracement of recent decline (11171-10276) is placed at 10725-10830 and the breakdown level and Budget low is placed at 10880 levels.  The index is likely to consolidate and form a base formation in this broad range, which is likely to act as a foundation for next leg of rally in line with long-term bullish price structure  We expect the Nifty to hold its key support zone of 10100-10300 in the current decline. The key support is marked by the confluence of:  * 80% retracement of December 2017 &ndash; January 2018 rally (10075-11171) at 10295 which was held in current week&rsquo;s panic decline  * The strong base formation in November 2017 and a panic low of Gujarat election result day is placed in the 10033-10075 region  * Long-term 200-day rising moving average is placed at 10033 levels  Here is a list of two stocks which could give up to 20% return in the next 6 months:  Zee Entertainment: BUY CMP &ndash; 581| Target Rs698| Stop Loss Rs540| Return 20%| Time Frame 6 months  The share price of Zee Entertainment managed to topple its CY2000 peak in late 2016. Since then, it has been in a consolidation mode thereby discounting the disruptions created by key reforms like demonetisation and implementation of GST.  Recently, the stock has moved above its 2016 high and is seen consolidating above the breakout area in the last one-month signalling positive bias and resumption of a fresh uptrend.  The share price corrected from its October 2016 peak of Rs589 to anchor around Rs430 in December 2016. The subsequent 12-month period witnessed a basing pattern wherein the stock discounted a host of headwinds while maintaining a higher bottom formation.  The entire price action during this period has taken the shape of a contracting symmetrical triangle, which is a continuation pattern.  The consolidation, which is viewed as a secondary corrective phase within the primary uptrend, has rested upon long-term 52-week EMA. In early December 2017, the share price resolved higher out of a triangle pattern signalling end of corrective bias and resumption of the uptrend.  The aforementioned technical observations make us believe the consolidation phase that lasted over 12 months has come to maturity, in turn, giving a fresh entry opportunity.  We expect the stock to move higher towards the projected target of Rs710 in the medium term being the measuring implication of the triangular pattern breakout.  Reliance Industries: BUY at CMP Rs894| Target Rs1070| Stop Loss Rs810| Return 20% Time Frame 6 months  The share price of Reliance industries has been consolidating between the range of 970 and 870 in the last four months thus forming a base for the next up move.  The stock is currently placed near the lower band of the recent consolidation thus providing fresh entry opportunity to ride the next up move in the stock  The overall positive structural trend still remains intact as the five weeks of a rally during September to October 2017 from Rs785 to Rs960, went through nine weeks&rsquo; time wise correction, got retraced by 50% of the entire leg of up move.  The limited price wise correction corresponding to elongated time correction shows inherit strength and foretell positive momentum, going ahead.  Among the oscillators, the daily stochastic has generated a bullish crossover above its nine period&rsquo;s average thus supports the positive bias in the stock in the short term.  The above-mentioned technical evidence suggests the four months&rsquo; consolidation is likely to conclude, in turn, giving a fresh entry opportunity.  We expect the stock to move higher towards the projected target of Rs1070 in the medium term being the price equality of the last leg of up move from Rs779&ndash; 958 as projected from the recent trough of Rs895.

However, Reliance came up and snapped up the rights, two people aware of the matter told the paper.  If the deal comes across, Reliance Industries will control all Mothercare&nbsp;outlets in India, which are currently run by DLF Brands, the report said.  DLF Brands and Reliance Brands did not respond to an email query and Mothercare declined to comment.  Several global brands including Mango, Forever 21 and Sephora have shift hands from DLF Brands in the Indian retail market. The local franchisee rights of Mango was acquired by online fashion retailer Myntra.com last year, while Forever 21's India business was acquired by the Aditya Birla Group in 2016.  DLF Brands had bought the franchise rights of Mothercare for 15 years in 2009.&nbsp;Currently, Mothercare operates through dozens of outlets and department store chain such as &nbsp;Shoppers Stop in India.  FirstCry.com was interested in acquiring Mothercare's distribution rights in India to mark its presence in the growing kids product market. The UK-based multinational specialises in products for expectant mothers and children up to 6 years old.  The market for baby and mother care products is growing on account of urbanisation, which has led to a rise in the number of nuclear families with both parents working.&nbsp;As a result, per capita expenditure on mother and child care has increased.  According to RNCOS, a business consulting service firm, India's baby care market is expected to post a CAGR of over 15 percent during 2015-2022.  In 2017, Mothercare's international sales during the crucial Christmas trading period declined 3 percent year-on-year, while like-for-like sales in the UK fell 7.2 percent and online sales dropped 6.9 percent.  The retailer reduced its total number of stores and discounted heavily in its end-of-season sale in its home country, according to reports.

Niko had in mid-2015 chosen to withdraw from the NEC-25 block and relinquish its interest to the remaining stakeholders.  RIL is the operator of the block with 60 per cent interest while BP of the UK has the remaining 30 per cent stake.  The 10 per cent stake has been split between RIL and BP in proportion to their equity stake.  Gas discoveries in North-East Coast block NEC-0SN-97/1 (NEC-25) hold recoverable reserves of 1.032 trillion cubic feet.  The Canadian company has been facing cash problems and had even put up for sale its interest in NEC-25 as well as 10 per cent stake in RIL's Krishna Godavari basin oil and gas producing block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6. It could not find a buyer though.  Last year, RIL had stated that the block oversight panel, called Management Committee (MC), has reviewed the declaration of commerciality (DoC) of gas find D-32 in the block.  MC is headed by upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), which had previously refused to give formal recognition to the D-32 and D-40 discoveries in the block due to absence of its mandated confirmatory tests.  The DGH had also previously not approved a USD 3.5 billion plan for developing gas discoveries in block NEC-25 in the absence of its prescribed Drill Stem Test (DST) to confirm two of the finds.  Thereafter, the partners decided to go for the DST test on one of the finds and relinquish or give up the other.  The presentation did not say if the partner have submitted a revised field development plan (FDP).  RIL in March 2013 had submitted a USD 3.5 billion Integrated Field Development Plan for producing 10 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the discoveries D- 32, D-40, D-9 and D-10 in NEC-25 by mid-2019.  The DGH, the nodal technical arm of the oil ministry, however refused to bring the development plan to the Management Committee for approval, disputing commerciality of D-32 and D-40 in the absence of Drill Stem Tests (DSTs).  RIL-BP-Niko decided to relinquish D-40 and conduct DST on D-32.  According to RIL, D-32 and D-40 hold an in-place reserve of up to 663 billion cubic feet capable of producing 170 million standard cubic feet per day.  RIL has so far made eight gas discoveries in the block.  MC reviewing the commerciality of D-32 paved the way for re-submission of the field development plan (FDP) and its consideration by the committee, sources said.

",,"Companies, Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries, reliance jio, Result Analysis, RIL",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/result-analysis/petrochem-volumes-drove-compelling-reliance-q3jio-stoleshow_10381501.html,"Ruchi Agrawal and Nitin Agrawal Moneycontrol Research  Reliance Industries (RIL) reported a stellar quarter with strong performance across segments.&nbsp;While refining margins witnessed slight softness, in line with global trends, the earnings were substantially driven by a robust increase in petrochemical volumes. The retail segment threw a positive surprise with a more than doubling of revenues and profits.  However, what stole the show was the performance of the telecom venture, Jio, which in addition to a strong EBIDTA (earnings before interest depreciation and tax) posted its first quarterly after-tax-profit.    Segment wise performance      Refining: Slight softness but above the Street's expectation  Despite a slight sequential softness, gross refining margins (GRM) at USD 11.6 per billion barrels (bbl) were up 7.4 percent year on year (YoY) &ndash; USD 4.4/bbl above the benchmark Singapore refining margins. While revenues were up 23 percent YoY, EBIT (earnings before interest &amp;amp;amp; tax) slipped by 0.5 percent YoY due to the resumption of supplies after the hurricane season in the United States, which led to some softness in gasoline margins.  However, lower diesel cracks, positive naphtha cracks, weaker fuels and oil cracks and lower Arab light and heavy differential helped in sourcing and improved the overall complex refining margins.  The company now aims to expand its downstream presence, which stands at 1,291 outlets, with a simultaneous increase in overall throughput for petrol and diesel.    Petrochemicals &ndash; frontrunner in driving profitability  Petrochemicals segment stood as the frontrunner in driving the consolidated profitability with a record performance during the quarter, driven by an increase in volumes and a favorable product mix. Revenues increased by 47 percent while EBIT was up 73 percent YoY.  Production volume swelled by 7 percent at 8 million tonnes on the back of MEG and polyethylene production along with demand expansion in all major polymer products. The record EBIT was driven by higher margins in polypropylene and downstream polyester products  Upstream segment flattish  While the revenues saw a YoY increase of 34 percent, the profitability remained near flattish despite an increase the crude oil prices during the quarter. The uptick in revenues was largely due to commencement of CBM production and higher oil and gas price realizations. Domestic production declined 15 percent while US shale gas production fell by 14 percent YoY.  Jio  Jio reported revenue from operations of Rs 6,879 crores (up 11.9 percent qoq) and added 21.5 million subscribers over the last quarter bringing the subscriber base to 160.1 million at the end of December 2017. This gets translated into average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 154 per month (down 1.5 percent qoq), much better than its peers.    In terms of operating margin, Jio reported a significant expansion of 1472.5 bps in its EBITDA margin, which came at 38.2 percent. The expansion was primarily due to reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 34.8 percent of revenues from operations to 15.7 percent in this quarter. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had cut interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).  Additionally, the management attributes this performance to use of efficient 4G technology and significant addition of the paying customers for the quarter.  Organized retail  With the base of the demonetization quarter last year, the retail business delivered an impressive performance across all retail lines. The revenues and EBIT at Rs 18,798 crore and Rs 487 crore more than doubled YoY during the quarter. The company opened 72 new stores and aims to further expand retail presence in coming quarters.  Refinery off-cracker plant fully commissioned  The company has recently completed the full commissioning of the refinery cracker plant at Jamnagar which will use the refinery residue as a feedstock for the petrochemical business thereby ensuring cost advantage with vertical integration. This would help in further improving margins for the petrochemical business.  What next?  Post the end of an aggressive capex cycle. With a net capex at Rs 17,300 crore during the quarter RIL now stands at a sweet spot where most of its projects have started delivering and the company is likely to see a big cash flow boost in upcoming quarters with an uptick in the returns.  With the commissioning of the refinery of cracker plant we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business, which is already posting aggressive growth.  We believe that Jio would continue to maintain growth momentum on the back of a smart business strategy, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India. All this is likely to lead to further value unlocking from the telecom venture.

Tracking the results, most analysts expect the stock to open higher when trading resumes on Monday and possible rally to a fresh record high in the coming week.  The stock is just 3 percent short of its record high of Rs 959.50. RIL has already rallied nearly 80 percent in the last one year.  Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL in an interview to CNBC-TV18 said that GRMs at USD 11.6/bbl is largely in line. Overall, the numbers are in-line and ahead of estimates what we calculated.  Commenting on the stock, Bhasin said that if something can take you to 11,000 on the Nifty, I think it will be RIL. The IUC cut has been very poorly received by Bharti Airtel and Idea but will be a big blessing for Jio. Going forward, RIL will not be a laggard and if Nifty hits 11,000, RIL will be at Rs 1000, which could happen in next 3 days or a week, but is definitely on cards.  SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com in an interview to CNBC-Tv18 said that no analyst would have thought that Jio would report PAT in FY18 which we have seen in case of Q3. Having posted an EBITDA of Rs 2,628 crore with a Rs504 crore is a blast for Reliance Jio and will cheer markets going forward.  Commenting on the stock movement, Tulsian said that I will not be surprised to see the share moving into four digits ahead of the Budget or maybe in the coming week.  We have collated top 10 takeaways from RIL Q3 results:  Net Profit  RIL reported a consolidated net profit of Rs9423 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, up 16.2 percent QoQ compared to Rs8109 crore reported in the previous quarter and Rs7533 reported in the year-ago period. On a standalone basis, RIL reported a net profit of Rs8454 crore.  Net Revenues  RIL achieved revenue of Rs109,905 crore (USD 17.2 billion), an increase of 30.5 percent as compared to Rs84,189 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  The increase in revenue is primarily on account of volume increase with the start-up of petrochemicals projects and increase in prices in refining and petrochemical businesses.  The increase in consolidated revenues reflects robust growth of 116% in Retail business and continued enhancement in Jio&rsquo;s wireless operations.  Operating Profit  Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 52.0 percent to Rs17,588 crore (USD 2.8 billion) from Rs11,574 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Strong operating performance was driven by growth in petrochemicals, retail and digital services businesses along with firm refining margins.  Cash on Books  Cash and cash equivalents as on 31st December 2017 were at Rs78,617 crore (USD 12.3 billion) compared to Rs77,226 crore as on 31st March 2017. These were in bank deposits, mutual funds, CDs, Government Bonds and other marketable securities.  Capital Expenditure  The capital expenditure for the quarter ended 31st December 2017 was Rs17,336 crore (USD 2.7 billion) including exchange rate difference capitalization.  Capital expenditure was principally on account of Digital Services business, the balance of expenditure for projects in the petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar and in Organized Retail business.  Refining  Revenue from the Refining and Marketing segment for the quarter ended December 2017 increased by 23 percent on a YoY basis to Rs75,865 crore (USD 11.9 billion) aided by 24 percent higher Brent oil prices.  The segment EBIT marginally decreased by 0.5 percent on a YoY basis to Rs6,165 crore (USD 1.0 billion).  GRMs  Gross Refining Margins (GRM) for 3Q FY18 stood at USD 11.6/bbl as against USD 10.8/bbl in 3Q FY17. RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex refining margins by USD 4.4/bbl.  Petrochemicals Business  The revenue from the Petrochemicals segment for the quarter ended December 2017 increased by 47.6 percent on a YoY basis to Rs33,726 crore (USD 5.3 billion) due to higher volumes and prices.  Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level of Rs5,753 crore (USD 901 million) supported by strong volume growth, higher margins for Polypropylene and downstream polyester products. The volume growth was led by the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC coming on-stream along with downstream LDPE, LLDPE and MEG plants.  Reliance Jio  Reliance Jio posted a Q3 profit at Rs 504 crore and EBITDA grew by 82 percent to Rs 2,628 crore QoQ. Jio continues its rapid ramp-up of subscriber base and as of 31st December 2017, there were 160.1 million subscribers on the network.  This makes it India&rsquo;s largest wireless data subscriber base, with the gap widening from the other operators. With gross additions of 27.8 million during the quarter, Jio continues to have a dominant share of all the new LTE smartphones sold in the country.  Reliance Retail  Revenues from the retail segment for the 3Q FY18 grew by 116.4 percent on a YoY basis to Rs18,798 crore compared to Rs8,688 crore reported in the year-ago period.  PBDIT for 3Q FY18 grew by 82.0 percent on a YoY basis to Rs606 crore from Rs333 crore reported in the year-ago period.

Consolidated revenue from operations during the quarter grew 7.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (21.75 percent YoY) to Rs 1,02,500 crore, aided by volume increase with start-up&nbsp;of petrochemicals projects and increase in prices in refining and petrochemical businesses.  &amp;quot;This quarter marks the culmination of petrochemical expansion projects and the first positive net profit contribution from newest business line &mdash;&nbsp;Digital Services,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries said.  &amp;quot;Refining business has delivered 12 consecutive quarter of double-digit refining margins, demonstrating operating excellence and healthy industry fundamentals,&amp;quot; he added.  RIL's gross refining margin (GRM) came in at USD 11.6 a barrel was in line with CNBC-TV18 poll of USD 11.6 a barrel and outperformed Singapore complex refining margins by USD 4.4 a barrel.&nbsp;The flagship company of Reliance Group had reported GRM at USD 12 a barrel in September quarter.  Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL in an interview to CNBC-TV18 said that GRMs was largely in line and overall, the numbers were also in-line.  Ambani said, &amp;quot;Benefits of the large investments in petrochemical business are beginning to show with the segment reporting its highest ever earnings.&amp;quot;  Petrochemical business showed a sequential growth of 20.45 percent (up 47.6 percent YoY) at Rs 33,726 crore with record level EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) rising 16 percent (73 percent YoY) due to higher volumes and prices.  Refining segment registered a 8.74 percent growth quarter-on-quarter (23 percent YoY) at Rs 75,865 crore with EBIT falling 6.89 percent QoQ. Higher brent oil prices aided refining business.  Consolidated operating profit (EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 13 percent sequentially to Rs 17,588 crore and margin expanded by 60 basis points to 17.6 percent.  Reliance Jio, which has subscriber base of 16.01 crore, clocked its first-ever profit at Rs 504 crore for the December quarter against loss of Rs 271 crore in previous quarter.  &amp;quot;The interconnection usage charges (IUC) cut has been very poorly received by Bharti Airtel and Idea but will be a big blessing for Jio,&amp;quot; Bhasin said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  At operational level, Jio's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) grew by 82 percent sequentially to Rs 2,628 crore in Q3 and margin expanded by 1,470 basis points to 38.2 percent compared to previous quarter.  &amp;quot;Jio&rsquo;s strong financial result reflects the fundamental strength of the business, significant efficiencies and right strategic initiatives. Jio has demonstrated that it can sustain its strong financial performance,&amp;quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  Jio continued its rapid ramp-up of subscriber base. As of December 31, 2017, there were 16.01 crore subscribers on its network with gross subscriber addition of 2.78 crore and net subscriber addition of 2.15 crore during the quarter.  Average revenue per user (ARPU) stood at Rs 154 per subscriber per month in December quarter against Rs 156.4 in September quarter. Total wireless data traffic of 431 crore GB (9.6 GB per subscriber per month) for quarter ended December 2017.  Reliance Retail, which witnessed stellar performance across all consumption baskets during the quarter, grew by 28.3 percent QoQ (116.4 percent YoY) to Rs 18,798 crore for the quarter ended December 2017. Its EBIT growth was 45.8 percent QoQ and 110.8 percent YoY at Rs 487 crore in Q3.  The capital expenditure of Rs 17,336 crore (USD 2.7 billion) for the quarter ended December 2017 was principally on account of digital services business, balance of expenditure for projects in the petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar and in organised retail business, the company said.  Finance cost during the quarter declined to Rs 2,095 crore from Rs 2,272 crore in September quarter.  Reliance Industries in Q3 reported standalone profit growth of 2.3 percent at Rs 8,454 crore and revenue growth of 5.8 percent at Rs 75,913 crore compared to Q2FY18.

The most valued company on D-Street, with a market capitalization of Rs 5.83 lakh crore, has already rallied nearly 80 percent in the last one year and nearly 6 percent since its September quarter results.  The revenues are likely to grow by 15 percent to Rs 78,913 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, compared to Rs 68,532 crore reported in the previous quarter.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is likely to rise by 4 percent to Rs 13,496 crore for the quarter ended December, compared to Rs 12,983 crore reported in the previous quarter.  Analysts expect RIL&rsquo;s gross refining margins (GRMs) to come in at around USD 11.6 per barrel compared to USD 12 per barrel reported in the previous quarter. GRM is the difference between the per-barrel price of crude and the value of finished products distilled from it.  Here&rsquo;s what other brokerages are recommending:   Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE):   Higher petrochemical business is likely to offset refining business on a standalone basis. Lower IUC for Jio to boost overall results. KIE expects RIL to report 1 percent QoQ increase in standalone EBITDA to Rs 13,070 crore and 3 percent QoQ increase in net income to Rs 8,510 crore, despite sequentially lower refining margins at USD 11.6/bbl.  Kotak models RIL&rsquo;s consolidated net income at Rs 8,710 crore (EPS of 14.7) in 3QFY18, factoring in modest profit of Rs 48 crore from Jio as compared to loss of Rs 270 crore in 2QFY18 led by reduction in IUC costs, which will be offset by likely &lsquo;accounting&rsquo; of higher operating costs.  Sharekhan:  Sharekhan expects GRM of Reliance Industries (RIL) to decline on a sequential basis to USD 11.6/bbl in Q3FY2018 compared to USD 12/bbl reported in Q2FY2018.  The same would get offset by strong performance of the petrochemicals segment, which we expect to benefit from higher volumes (on account of ramp up of the recently commissioned petchem expansion projects) and feedstock benefit from U.S. ethane imports.  Overall, Sharekhan expects Q3FY2018 earnings of RIL to increase by 5.5 percent on a YoY basis (+2.4 percent q-o-q) to Rs 8,465 crore.

India's Petroleum Planning &amp;amp;amp; Analysis Cell (PPAC) in its October report showed 35.2 million tonnes a year as the installed capacity of Reliance's refinery in the special economic zone (SEZ) at Jamnagar, in northwest India. That is up from 27 million tonnes, or 540,000 barrels per day (bpd), as of April 1 that PPAC reported in an August 2017 report.  The new capacity is the equivalent of 704,000 bpd of crude processing.  Reliance built its first refinery at Jamnagar with an installed capacity of 660,000 bpd in 1999. This refinery sells most of its fuels in the local market. The SEZ plant was added in 2008 and turned the entire Jamnagar complex into the world's largest oil processing site.  Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed that Reliance has declared the increased SEZ capacity, which they said the company attributed to debottlenecking, or a by streamlining the processes at the plant.  &amp;quot;They have declared enhanced capacity,&amp;quot; said one of the sources by telephone, without providing details on how the company raised the capacity.  Reliance has been consistently operating its export-oriented refinery at a rate higher than the nameplate capacity  Reliance had no immediate comment on the increase when contacted by Reuters.  Although most of the products from the SEZ plant are meant for overseas market, some like cooking gas are sold in local markets.  Reliance's refineries are among the most complex in the world and have facilities that can maximize the production of diesel and gasoline from so-called heavy, or higher density, crude oil that typically sells for less than other crude grades.  Reliance, in a presentation to India's Center for High Technology (CHT), said it wanted to raise the capacity of its Jamnagar complex to 100 million tonnes a year by 2030, sources last year told Reuters.  CHT is a unit of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that evaluates projects and assesses their technological requirements.

The downstream expansions called J3 are likely to fully stabilise in early 2018 and should allow almost a full year of benefit to flow in FY2019.  RIL, which completed its capital expenditure cycle, yesterday announced commissioning of the world's largest refinery off-gas cracker complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. ROGC will use refinery process residue to produce feedstock used to make petrochemicals.  It is in the advanced stage of commissioning a petcoke gasification plant, which will convert coal and coke, the lowest-cost fossil fuels, into gas.  CLSA said the monetisation of the two plants will boost the operating income of the company but all the benefits will come only in the next financial year.  &amp;quot;Although it has indicated potential annual benefit of USD 2-2.5 billion, we model a smaller amount of USD 1.8 billion from these two projects.

By the end of the year, there were only three major players left in the market. ",,"2017 Review, Aircel, Business, Idea Cellular, Merger and Acquisition (M&A), Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices, Telecom, Vodafone, Vodafone India",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/telecom-sector2017-a-year-marked-by-bitter-competitionconsolidation_10280361.html,"Moneycontrol News  On Tuesday, Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications said that the telecom sector has become a money guzzler where only those with deep pockets can survive.  Even the &amp;quot;mighty&amp;quot; house of Tatas had to &amp;quot;gift away&amp;quot; their telecom business (to Airtel), Ambani asserted, sounding bitter about the regulatory framework. He said the long time taken to clear&nbsp;RCom's merger with Systema Shyam Telecom represents an &amp;quot;unease of doing business&amp;quot;.  For every telecom company in India that cannot be considered a giant in the sector, the last couple of years have been the same. Companies have had to either pump in a lot of money into their business to stay competitive enough to survive, or merge themselves with other companies. And as if that were not enough, when companies did try to merge with each other, they were held up by regulatory hurdles.  So when Reliance Jio finally arrived late last year, other telcos were left high and dry quite literally. According to a report by Kleiner Perkins Internet Trends 2017, India&rsquo;s wireless consumer data prices fell 48 percent as incumbent mobile operators responded to Jio&rsquo;s pricing.  The Jio effect  As of September this year, the top three telcos in the country had together lost over 50 lakh subscribers, according to a report by Business Standard. Idea and Vodafone had lost 28 lakh and 24 lakh subscribers, respectively, while Airtel's base contracted by two lakh subscribers, the report said.  However, Prashant Singhal, Global telecommunications Leader at EY, told the newspaper that for a market like India, it was the revenue that must be monitored to check a telcos' health rather than the subscriber base.  &amp;quot;The health of industry is driven by revenue and we have to see if revenue is shifting in favour of&nbsp;Reliance Jio.&nbsp;In India, people have got multiple SIMs and losing subscribers does not give a clear indication of an operator&rsquo;s health,&amp;quot; Singhal said.  Both Airtel and Vodafone were forced to slash tariff after they started losing customers to Jio. However, the two companies continue to charge for voice calls and text messages, at least on some of their plans, whereas these services are offered free of cost by Jio on all its plans.  The country's largest telecom operator&nbsp;Bharti Airtel's consolidated net profit for the second quarter fell 6.6 percent, dented by pricing pressure, while Vodafone saw its operating profit fall 39 percent year-on year in the first half of this fiscal year.  Speaking to The Economic Times, Bharti Airtel's Sunil Mittal had said that Jio's entry with prolonged free offers had led to unexpectedly rapid consolidation.  &amp;quot;Market has consolidated to a level which was an aspiration, but never thought would be a possibility. Now we're looking at 3-4 players. Number 2 Vodafone and Number 3 Idea being put together, is unprecedented... you never see two strong companies merging...this is just because the market structure has got completely damaged,&amp;quot; he told the newspaper.  Mittal estimated that around USD 40-50 billion (approximately Rs 2.5-3.2 lakh crore) has been written off by various telecom companies, which he believes is &amp;quot;largely due to Jio&amp;quot;.  However, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani quickly rebutted Mittal, saying businesses must stop looking at regulators and governments to guarantee their profits, according to a report by Gadgets Now.  Speaking to CNBC-TV18, former chairman of Micromax Sanjay Kapoor said in October that consolidation in the telecom space is good, while competition remains severe.  According to Kapoor, two things are happening in the sector. Firstly, there is clear consolidation in a space where an unsustainable perfect competition structure is dying down. A more sustainable structure is now coming into shape and three long-term players seem to be standing out.  Secondly, he said, Jio starting to publish its earnings numbers will drive change in behaviour of other telcos, considering their revenue steams had been completely disrupted by the new carrier.  According to a report by The Hindu BusinessLine, analysts at Goldman Sachs feel that as a result of consolidation, consumers can hope to benefit from their service providers who are on a stronger footing to expand their networks and improve quality of service.  Indian telecom companies are now looking for mergers and acquisitions to stay ahead of the competition. In February, Telecom Secretary JS Deepak said that the Indian telecom market would eventually consolidate to have only five major players. He also said &amp;quot;consolidation is going to be very good for India as we are likely to get four private and one government player (BSNL-MTNL), which is ideal.&amp;quot;  According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), there were more than 1.18 billion wireless telephone subscribers in the country in April this year, being serviced by as many as 12 operators.  For the telecom sector in India, 2017 was a year marked by unprecedented consolidation. Here are some of the&nbsp;key mergers and acquisitions of the sector from this year:  Airtel and Tata Teleservices  In October, Airtel announced a merger&nbsp;of its mobile operations with struggling Tata Teleservices. According to the deal, Airtel would acquire Tata's consumer mobile business in 19 circles.  The merger was done on a debt-free, cash-free basis. The deal also gave Airtel access to Tata's 1,800, 2,100 and 850 MHz spectrum bands, all widely used for 4G. In December, both boards had cleared terms for the customer business merger.  Vodafone and Idea Cellular  India's second largest (Vodafone) and third largest (Idea) telecom operators are now in the process of merging to form what would become the country's largest operator. The merged entity will also be the world's second largest telecom service provider.  According to the terms of the deal, Idea's parent entity Aditya Birla Group will gradually raise its stake in the combined entity while the Vodafone Group will reduce its stake until both their shares are equal. The two companies have received regulatory approval and have started picking key executives. They are hopeful that the merger will be concluded in 2018.  Airtel acquires Telenor India and Tikona  In February, Airtel bought Telenor's ailing Indian subsidiary, Telenor India. According to the deal, Airtel took over Telenor India's liabilities pertaining to licence fees and lease obligations for mobile towers.  The deal, which gave Airtel 44 million additional users, did not involve any cash payment to Telenor. Airtel also got Telenor India's 43.4 MHz spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band as a part of the deal.  In September this year, Airtel announced it had fully acquired Tikona Digital Network's share capital. Earlier, the company had announced a plan to purchase Tikona's 4G airwaves for Rs 1,600 crore. The acquisition gave the Sunil Mittal-led telecom company access to Tikona's 4G spectrum in five circles.  Reliance Communications and Aircel  In April 2017, Reliance Communications and Aircel approved a merger that would create one of the largest networks in the country in terms of subscribers. RCom and Aircel's parent firm Maxis were supposed to own 50 percent stake each in the merged entity.  The proposed merger was crucial for RCom as it would have retired Rs 25,000 crore of debt from its total debt of around Rs 45,000 crore. However, RCom shelved merger talks with Aircel, citing regulatory uncertainties.  On December 26, RCom unveiled a new resolution plan to reduce its debt by up to Rs 39,000 crore through prepayment and sale of assets and form a new RCom with debt levels of less than Rs 6,000 crore.  The resolution plan involves exiting strategic debt restructuring (SDR) and monetising some of the company's assets, including transfer of spectrum liabilities by March 2018.

While Reliance Communication will use the proceeds to pare its debt, Jio will benefit out of the deal as the newly procured assets will augment Jio's Fibre-To-Home which is expected to launch in 2018. The deal will also supplement Jio in its enterprise operations.  Commenting on the deal Rajan Mathews, DG of COAI said, &ldquo;It is a good thing that it was bid out in a very transparent manner and the bidding shows that, the remaining players are very keen and are now strategic in nature in terms of going forward.&rdquo;  &ldquo;The emerging landscape of the three dominant players &mdash; Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea combine &mdash; is going to be the landscape of the operator community going forward,&rdquo; he added.

He said, &ldquo;Mukesh Ambani through Reliance Jio is going to dominate the telecom sector and that is his whole intention of acquiring this particular thing from Anil Ambani group.

So, it is a win-win situation.&rdquo;  Former Telecom and IT Minister Milind Deora said the deal is a healthy sign for the telecom sector. He said, &ldquo;Telecom sector has been great for the consumer, the country and for our productivity over the last decade or so.

On startups, it said the size of funding received is substantially smaller than by those in the US and China, reflecting the limited success of the country's AI startups.

",,"Business, Companies, reliance jio, Technology",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance-jio-may-hike-tariffs2018-opensignal_10205121.html,"Moneycontrol News  After a year in which it has shaken up the telecom sector with cheap data and free voice calling, Reliance Jio may hike tariffs in 2018, according to a report.  OpenSignal, a London-based firm which specialises in crowdsourced wireless coverage mapping all over the world, said that although Jio&rsquo;s entry into the market resulted in data prices becoming much cheaper&nbsp;&ndash; which resulted in increased number of 4G consumers &ndash; it doubts whether Jio will be able to retain its position at the helm.  &amp;quot;The trend will continue next year. Whether Jio remains a huge dominant driver in 4G growth remains to be seen. After a year of free and steeply discounted data pricing, Jio may make 2018 the year it raises prices. That could level the playing field for India's operators,&amp;quot; said Andrea Toth from OpenSignal.  Since its launch in September 2016, Jio has&nbsp;triggered a bitter price war with the existing players&nbsp;in the market. With Jio&rsquo;s highly disruptive entry, all the telco players saw a sharp decrease in revenues and had to drastically&nbsp;change their strategy and product mix in order to find other ways of generating revenues. Such was Jio&rsquo;s impact that voice and SMS services, which once generated a lion&rsquo;s share of revenue for telcos, are now being offered as freebies.  With data priced at &lsquo;next to nothing&rsquo; on launch, Jio's customer base grew at a dizzying pace. Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani led Reliance Industries, added a customer base of about 16 million in the first month of its launch. The company crossed 50 million subscriber mark in 83 days of its launch, becoming the fastest company ever to do so.  &amp;quot;Jio's widespread 4G access, along with its at-first free and later heavily discounted data and voice plans, quickly won the hearts &mdash;&nbsp;and wallets &mdash;&nbsp;of more than 100 million mobile users across the country,&amp;quot; Toth added.  Jio not only made 4G VoLTE a household name but also helped transform India's image of a country struggling to develop 4G VoLTE technology to one of the top countries in terms of 4G VoLTE connectivity and reach and the fastest growing mobile market in the world.

",,"Business, Companies, Mukesh Ambani",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/aheadschedulegenerating-returnsjio-says-mukesh-ambani_10153641.html,"Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Friday that telecom venture Jio is ahead of schedule in terms of generating returns.  Jio has shaken up the telecom sector with its free voice calling and cheap data tariffs since it was launched 14 months ago. Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Ambani countered the perception of Jio destroying the competition by saying that what mattered most is that the consumer gains and the industry moves forward.  Ambani also said that education and healthcare will be on his radar in the future.  Below is the transcript of the interview.  Q: You spoke about the huge amount of investment that you have made in Jio. There have been questions asked in several quarters about your ability to recoup this investment and how much time it would take. Everyone knows how shroud you are a businessmen, so it is highly unlikely that you would be doing things for charity. So, how soon do you expect Jio to turn profitable?  A: Jio's results are declared every quarter now and you can see the trend and watch the next few quarters, you will learn in January and you will learn in March. I do not want to predict, but I think we are ahead of our schedule in terms of the returns that we are generating.  Q: Which should we watch closely, January or March?  A: Watch all the three quarters.  Q: How do you decide how to enter a business? You spoke about all these interesting new areas that are emerging. What are the parameters a business has to meet before Reliance decides, it wants to enter it?  A: The Reliance DNA started from my father when he founded Reliance. At that time, he has ingrained into us that as a business, you must solve problems and the economic value is more a by-product of that. So if you look at the history of Reliance, we started with clothing people, we started with textiles, we went into developing the textile industry, then built our refinery which was really energy security. We solved the problem at that time in terms of India not importing diesel and petrol.  If we look at our own entry into retail, it was linked to the need for employment creation and as our balance sheet becomes stronger, we still look to solve problems to create societal values and now, I challenge myself and our people to solve the more difficult problems and we can take some risks.  So what we did with Jio is really, we put in and not many in the world had backed us. But, as I just explained, we are strong believers that if India and 1.3 billion Indians have to participate in this new world, for us, we cannot always have the data infrastructure 20 years after the world. We would have no chance. Today, we have along with Rajan and Kumar, with all of us as one industry, I think India, in terms of data infrastructure will be ahead of the US by 2019.  So as we move forward, we think about more and more difficult issues that create value for all Indians. I think that agriculture is difficult and that is something that needs to be taken. Education is important. And healthcare is the most difficult. So, we would clearly think about what we can do in each one of these areas.  Q: Follow up to that question, you spoke about creating value for all Indians. It was earlier this week, last week, one of your rivals in the telecom business had an interview in a newspaper where he spoke about Jio actually destroying 50 billion of their value in the telecom business. There is this perception that is there of Reliance entering into businesses and fundamentally disrupting them and destroying the competition. Do you think that would be an accurate assessment of what has happened in telecom?  A: Sunil is a good friend of mine, he is not a rival.  Q: A business rival.  A: I do not think of businesses in that way. The second piece - what he said and what you are interpreting is different. But just to make my point of view clear, I think that for all of us within industry, profits and losses are risks that we take and I do not think that we can rely on regulators or governments to guarantee our profits or losses.  To me, what is most important is do we really move the country forward and does the consumer gain? I think the question as a journalist you should be thinking about is that even if there are profits and losses, who gains and who loses? As long as the consumer gains and the country moves forward, it is worth taking those losses. Some of us are big boys, we can afford that.  Q: This question because a lot of people define you in terms of your wealth. I have seen a lot of descriptions that define you. What does money mean to you now?  A: Frankly, money has never meant much to me. I abhor the labels and the titles which all of you refer to in terms of where we are. But to me, resources enable you to take risks from a company point of view which you would have not done. So it gives you a little bit of flexibility.  On a personal level, very few people know this, but my sister Nina is somewhere in the audience. I have, from childhood, in school and together now, I have never carried money. So I do not have a credit card, I do not carry cash in my pocket. I always have somebody around me who pays for me. So that works.  Q: In the course of your speech you also mentioned agriculture and all of them are saying it is clearly an area where there is so much to be done. Why doesn't someone like you, why doesn't someone like Reliance get into that area in a really significant way and make a difference?  A: What I said is things that I genuinely believe. This is a time where things are coming together. There are combinatorial technologies without really covering the land mass with data technologies, without the sensors at the right price, without an overall vision - things have to come together and I think that things are coming together. India has a great opportunity and surely, as Reliance, this is a difficult problem to tackle. But we are ready to take on difficult problems and it is very much on our roadmap, we are building all the resources, we think through, we just do not jump into anything, we think through it carefully. But agriculture, education and healthcare, all three are on our roadmaps which are to my mind, the most difficult problems for any economy and they impact the majority of our people.  Q: You are thinking in terms of them?  A: Absolutely.  Q: Both in education and healthcare, you have these little foundational experiments that you have done. All three are probably areas that can benefit from the kind of scale that you usually bring to businesses.  A: Absolutely. Also, what we will be able to do in the next five years in terms of just raw usage of technology. This is the most difficult problem to solve. If we can solve it in India, we can pretty much use that anywhere else in the world. And that is why I say, India has the opportunity to lead the world. We have the opportunity first to solve it in India and then take it to the rest of the world.  Q: From its inception, Reliance has always had this reputation and image of being an extremely competitive company. You look at most of the businesses that you have gotten into, especially Jio for instance, you were not an early entrant, you were a relatively late entrant. There were incumbents in place and not just ordinary incumbents, but they were huge incumbents. You really seem to be relishing the challenge of this competition and everything else. So is this something you thrive on? Is it something that motivates you or do you just look at it from the consumer point of view?  A: Our DNA is that we are very focused and we always believe in the principle of saying that if you focus on the goal, you will overcome all obstacles. If you focus on the obstacle, you will never reach your goal. We are all believers of first principles and from our point of view, while the external world can see it, we work very hard and we focus on the goals that we want to achieve and we focus on first, principles.  We at Reliance, want to be the best in the world. It was even in the 1970s and 1980s when my father said that why should the Koreans and the Taiwanese lead the polyester industry? Why can't we in India? And today, we are known, we are the biggest in both, not only in size, but in quality. We had exactly the same conversation with Sunil and Rajan and ourselves in terms of saying that in the data driven digital services business, why can't India be the best? And that is what drives us. So, I am sorry if it appears very competitive from outside, but we just want to be the best in terms of what we do.  Q: Your children are now in the business and you worked very closely with your father when you first got into the business. What was the one thing which has really helped you that you learned from your father and what is the one thing which is really helping you now that you have learned from your children?  A: One thing that I could never, I would never dare tell my father is that dad, you do not get it. With this generation, that is the big difference.  Q: Do you get a lot of that?  A: I get quite a bit of that. I saw this speech and the first thing Isha told me is dad, very boring. I think, as far as my father is concerned, he has been really the biggest influence. He treated me like a friend and I hope that I can treat my children as a friend.  Q: What are you reading now? Do you get time to read?  A: I make it a point to read quite a bit. So I read a lot of technical stuff. So I am reading gene editing, CRISPR. Blockchain on the technical side. I read non-fiction. So I read five or six things at one time. In non-fiction I am reading, there is a great book that has come on Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson. He is my favourite author, so I read everything. Then I just finished Dan Brown's Origin.  Q: So you read fiction also.  A: So, I read fiction, non-fiction and technical, all at the same time.  Q: How would you define success?  A: For me, it is really fulfilment which is important which is the lasting satisfaction that you have, that you really tried your best and you have given it everything that you have. Sometimes, in spite of that, you might not achieve your outcome and you have to reconcile with that and that is what my philosophy in life is.

Moving from shadows in the audience to under the spotlight, Mukesh Ambani played it ever so smoothly. He called upon the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; of the telecom sector to look beyond profits and losses, and instead think about the difference they were making to the consumer, and thereby to the country.  The Reliance Industries Chairman and Managing Director had just delivered a speech that talked about India&rsquo;s rise in the world order and the role it could play to lead the fourth industrial revolution. Post his speech, Ambani answered a few questions posed by Hindustan Times Editor-in-Chief Sukumar Ranganathan.  &ldquo;To me what is most important is 'Do we really move the country forward' and 'Does the consumer gain?' and I think that the question as a journalist that you should be thinking about is that 'even if there are profits and losses, who gains and who loses, and as long as the consumer gains, and the country moves forward, it's worth taking those losses, right? Some of us are big boys, we can afford that,&rdquo; Ambani said in reply to a question that referred to a recent statement by Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal.  That message would surely travel fast; Sunil Mittal's brothers, Rakesh and Rajan, were a part of the audience.  Mittal had recently said in an interview that Reliance Jio Infocomm&rsquo;s entry into the sector had led to its rivals writing off USD 50 billion in investments. Ambani may have a point. With the entry of Jio in September last year, data tariffs have fallen to a fraction of their levels a year ago while India&rsquo;s ranking in terms of data consumption has jumped to number one from 150. Some of Reliance Jio&rsquo;s rivals have been around in the industry for over 20 years.  Delivering his speech that lasted 25 minutes, Ambani said RIL was willing to go beyond the Rs 60,000 crore it had put in its last investment cycle for the next round of growth. He listed agriculture, education and healthcare as three areas on the group&rsquo;s roadmap where it saw tremendous opportunities.  &ldquo;Five years ago, when most Indian businesses were investing outside India, we decided to invest about USD 60 billion in India. We have nearly completed this investment cycle and we are now ready to commit even more in our next investment cycle. We are doing this out of our undiminished conviction that India is the next biggest investment opportunity in the world,&rdquo; Ambani said.  He said the time had come for a combination of technologies to play a role in agriculture, education and healthcare and solve societal problems without bothering to turn to governments and regulators for profits and losses.  &ldquo;This (agriculture) is a difficult problem to tackle but we are ready to take on difficult problems. It&rsquo;s very much on our roadmap, building of the resources, thinking through. We don&rsquo;t just jump into anything, we think through it carefully. Agriculture, education and healthcare, all three are on our roadmap which, to my mind, are the most difficult,&rdquo; he said.  He called upon foreign investors to &ldquo;invest in India, earn in India, grow in India, partner and prosper together with India&rdquo;. Ambani said by the middle of this century, India&rsquo;s rise would be higher than China&rsquo;s and more attractive and give the world a &ldquo;superior development model&rdquo;.  He said, &ldquo;We are in the age of super-intelligence. What manufacturing was for China, super-intelligence will be for India.&rdquo;  He said India&rsquo;s USD 2.5 trillion&nbsp;economy would most certainly hit the USD 5 trillion mark well before 2024 and then double by 2030.  He said the next three decades will be most defining for India and the country was positioned to lead the next revolution. He said by 2050, the country would have 300 million more people to feed. &ldquo;There is a pressing need and golden opportunity to create a digital green revolution. Data is not only the new oil, data is also the new soil,&rdquo; he said.  He said the fourth industrial revolution would be led by connectivity, computing, data and artificial intelligence. He said the new age would have three defining characteristics &ndash; the first being the exponential changes that technology would bring as against linear changes that happened earlier.  The second defining characteristic, he said, would see scarcity giving way to abundance &ndash; abundance of abundance of energy, health, agricultural output, manufacturing capacity, abundant knowledge and renewable materials.  The THIRD defining characteristic would be a migration from a goods and services economy to one powered by intelligent services.  &ldquo;There is no doubt that in the coming years, machine intelligence will augment and multiply biological intelligence manifold,&rdquo; Ambani said.

Ambani was speaking at the 15th HT Leadership Summit partnered by CNN-News18.  The entire world is seeing a resurgent India, he said, adding that the next three decades will be defining years for the country.  The world so far has seen three important industrial revolutions from the late 17th century up until now even as it is now in the grip of the fourth -- one which is defined by data connectivity, AI and computing. India, which was on the fringes in the first two industrial revolutions, can reap the dividends of this ongoing transformation, said Ambani.  Outlining the three characteristics that will enable India to improve its position in the world order, Ambani said that there has been a migration from the linear to exponential. &ldquo;Mobile telephony, virtual assistance and self-driven cars were science fiction a few years ago. Early adopters of these will have the first mover advantage to leapfrog the competition and create societal value.&rdquo;  The world is moving from scarcity to abundance as well, he said, adding that with the power of data connectivity and intelligence, the price performance of everything changes drastically.  This abundance will be for all, not for a privileged few, he said, adding that mankind was on the doorstep of ubiquitous availability. Bringing up the rear was intelligent services, which Ambani believed, will be the next frontier of market leadership across countries.  We can become the provider of intelligent services to the world, he said. Being a young nation, India can adapt to technology easily, and its lack of legacy means it can skip multiple generations of technology and embrace the next generation. He also mentioned that India had the political vision and determination to make India a tech leader.  India is positioned to become a leader in this new age, he said. As early signs of the promise India shows, he mentioned the rollout of Aadhaar and ISRO&rsquo;s feat of launching 104 satellites at a low cost.  In terms of mobile broadband penetration, India was ranked 150 two years ago, but after Jio launching teelcom services, India is number one, he said.

The bonds were priced at 3.66 per cent, the lowest coupon ever achieved by an Indian corporate for a 10-year issuance, the company said in a statement.  RIL, which is rated the same as the sovereign, will use the proceeds to refinance existing debt. This was the first dollar note this year.  The note by RIL, India's largest company, was assigned 'BBB+' rating by S&amp;amp;amp;P and 'Baa2' by Moody's Investors Service.  &amp;quot;The notes have been priced at 130 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury Note, at a price of 100 to yield at 3.667 per cent,&amp;quot; the statement said.  They will bear fixed interest of 3.66 per cent per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears and shall rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company.  This, RIL said, was the tightest ever spread over US Treasury for an Indian entity for a 10-year issuance. Also, it was the tightest ever spread over US Treasury for a 10-year BBB corporate issuance from Asia ex-Japan since the global financial crisis.  &amp;quot;The company will use the proceeds to redeem its existing USD 800 million 5.875 per cent senior perpetual fixed rate unsecured notes pursuant to the terms of such notes,&amp;quot; it said.  The notes were over 1.6 times oversubscribed across 90 accounts.  V Srikanth, Joint Chief Financial Officer, RIL, said: &amp;quot;This refinancing transaction was well received by high quality investors across asset managers, insurance companies and banks and helped us achieve substantial savings in interest cost over the life of the notes.&amp;quot;  Issued against the backdrop of the upgrade of the country ratings by Moody's, RIL successfully concluded a swift intra- day execution to capitalise on the market window, he said. &amp;quot;We are delighted to have issued 10-year bonds at the lowest coupon ever for an Indian corporate.&amp;quot;  Once a net zero-debt company, RIL has borrowed heavily to fund its mega 4G telecom rollout. The company's debt swelled to Rs 2,14,145 crore at the end of September as compared to Rs 1,96,601 crore as on March 31, 2017. Cash in hand was marginally lower at Rs 77,014 crore.  Assigning its 'BBB+' rating for the bonds issue, S&amp;amp;amp;P Global Ratings had yesterday stated that RIL continues to bolster its business profile with new growth projects in its already large, integrated and efficient oil refining and petrochemical businesses.  &amp;quot;The completion of recent investments in the refining and petrochemical segment will further add to the company's cash flows,&amp;quot; it said, adding that RIL's diverse businesses with high levels of integration help offset the cyclicality inherent in the oil and gas and petrochemicals industries.  S&amp;amp;amp;P said RIL is on track to achieve Ebitda of about Rs 70,000 crore in the current fiscal and Rs 90,000 crore in 2018-19.  Ebitda was Rs 32,500 crore for the first half of the current fiscal.  Moody's Investors Service had separately stated that RIL's Baa2 rating reflects the company's strong ability to generate operating cash flows, with annual Ebidta exceeding USD 10 billion from its large-scale integrated refining and petrochemical operations &mdash; which generate strong margins &mdash; and the company's nascent but growing digital services business.

While the notable earning hits and misses did get the attention of the market, the aggregate numbers may give the big picture.  Hearteningly for the bulls, Indian Inc managed to overcome GST and demonetisation blues, and reported a decent operating performance overall.  The long road to profitability  The aggregate picture, which was quite dismal in the run-up to the GST in the previous quarter, has got better. Our analysis of over 4200 companies showed tepid growth in the topline, but surprisingly there was a marked improvement in margins. Finally, unlike in the previous quarter when profitability declined, there was some revival in the September quarter with the trend line flattening.    Importantly, the absolute number of companies reporting losses fell to 36 percent of the universe during the September quarter compared to 37 percent in the previous quarter.  Nifty &ndash; a much better show  The large-cap universe did not disappoint. For Nifty companies, aggregate revenue growth was a tad lower compared to the June quarter. However, EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation and tax) rose 14.7 percent year-on-year growth against a decline of over 5 percent in the preceding quarter. This aided the near double-digit growth in profit for the Nifty aggregate.    A key macro enabler of the performance, particularly for domestic-focused businesses was the re-stocking post GST implementation. An early festive season and the near-normal rains also aided sentiment.  Domestic-focused businesses like automobile, cement, consumer staples and consumer durables reported a good quarter. In the post result commentary, most companies said post GST restocking was gathering pace.  The winners from Nifty were names like Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, GAIL and ONGC. Bharti Airtel also reported a marked improvement in internals with strong cost control in India wireless and decent margin performance in Africa.  For financials, it was a mixed bag. While the likes of HDFC duo and IndusInd Bank were the usual steady performers, asset quality divergence took some sheen off Axis Bank and Yes Bank. For the rest, namely ICICI Bank and SBI, provisions remained elevated though incremental asset quality pain was not visible.  For the defensive sector, there wasn&rsquo;t anything overtly different to reverse the cautious outlook. In the reported numbers of most of the large IT companies, the struggle to drive growth, the trade-off between growth and margin and slow hiring were visible.  For most of the pharmaceutical companies caught between regulatory overhang and pricing pressure in the US generic business, there was little respite in the regulated markets. However, the India business appears to be getting back on track with restocking happening at a brisk pace.  The BSE 500 universe &ndash; early green shoots  &nbsp;The bigger winners of the rally in the markets have come from a broader universe like the BSE 500. At an aggregate level, the performance looks subdued compared to Nifty. But the broad trend was similar, with a distinct improvement in operating performance that had a positive rub-off on profitability.    While generalisation of the broad universe is incorrect, it was heartening to observe many winners within BSE 500 coming from a range of sectors. Hence, it wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong to conclude that the green shoots are emanating from different pockets.  There were a few sectoral winners like aviation, where all three listed airlines stocks reported strong numbers. Companies catering to metal and allied sectors also fared well.  A lot of the other winners, however, stood out on the strength of their respective business models. The notable names in this category are Avanti Feeds, Avenue Supermart, Bharat Forge, Caplin Point Lab, Chennai Petrochem, Dalmia Bharat, Godrej Industries, Godrej properties, Rain Industries, Future Retail etc. Our analysis suggests that close to 10 percent of the BSE 500 universe&nbsp; reported very healthy numbers.  The positivity is yet to reflect in the fortunes of companies that are critically dependent on the investment cycle. Infrastructure bellwether L&amp;amp;amp;T continues to remain sceptical about the revival in private capex.  Government capex, nevertheless, has gathered steam and the same was reflected in the much improved earnings of companies working in the road sector. Dilip Buildcon, IRB Infra and Sadbhav reported numbers that were worth taking note of.  BSE Midcap &ndash; weighed down by leveraged companies  In the BSE Mid Cap index, the bottomline performance was subdued compared to the operating numbers, with the indebted firms in the index to blame. The other important constituent, namely some of the mid- sized public sector banks, continued to disappoint on reported financials although there was visible improvement in incremental asset quality pain.    The laggards in this index were the over-leveraged companies like &nbsp;Adani Enterprise, GMR Infra, Jindal Steel and Power, Reliance Communications, Tata Communications, SAIL etc and the beleaguered lenders like Canara Bank, Central Bank and IDBI Bank.  What to expect from the market now?  India&rsquo;s overall macro indicators had worsened in recent times with growth falling, inflation firming up and crude looking set to spoil the party. However, we feel the recent reform announcements offer hope.  The economy is gradually coming out of the impact of twin disruptions of demonetisation and GST. Recent reports suggest that GST collections are improving. Finally, while monsoon was a bit lower, it wasn&rsquo;t altogether disappointing.  The fiscal neutral recapitalisation of PSU banks should help expedite the bad loan resolution process and eventually pave the way for revival in private capex after some serious restructuring in the state-owned banking sector. Till such time, it will be a journey of gradual revival with government in the driving seat to fill the void of the private players.  With minimum political risk in the horizon, relative strength of the macro and the green shoots from corporate earnings (the second half of FY18 has the support of a low base of last fiscal), markets are unlikely to de-rate. But further re-rating will be gradual as valuations at 21X FY18P earnings are not exactly cheap.   The relative strength of India vis-&agrave;-vis other economies and the fundamental shift in household savings pattern should keep the momentum going in the medium term. Investors should be watchful of any dip to accumulate well researched stock ideas.

R-Series is one of the three sets of discoveries in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block that RIL and its partner BP of UK are working to bring to production by 2021-22 to reverse the declining trend in output.  McDermott on its website confirmed award of the contract but did not give value of the deal.&nbsp;The company said it will provide &amp;quot;engineering, procurement, installation and pre-commissioning of subsea flowlines, vent lines, and a pipeline-end manifold for connection with six subsea wells in the R-cluster field at a water depth of up to 6,890 feet (2,100 meters).&amp;quot;  This is the first of three planned projects in KG-D6 that RIL-BP had announced in June, involving a cumulative investment of Rs 40,000 crore and producing from about 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas resources.  The R-series (D34) project is a dry gas development in water-depths of more than 2,000 metres, about 70 km offshore.&nbsp;It is to be developed by linking six producing wells with existing producing facilities at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&nbsp;and D3) gas fields in the block.  &amp;quot;The project is expected to produce up to 12 million cubic metres of gas a day, coming on stream in 2020,&amp;quot; RIL-BP had said in June.  McDermott said in addition to the R-Cluster of six subsea wells, RIL can give it the job of five to seven more subsea wells at the Satellite-cluster fields in the KG-D6 block.&nbsp;&amp;quot;The optional scope also consists of two additional subsea structures and flowlines at a water depth between 4,593 feet (1,400 meters) and 5,905 feet (1,800 meters),&amp;quot; it said.  McDermott said it plans to leverage its significant experience and presence within India including its Engineering Center of Excellence office in Chennai providing engineering and project management oversight for the project.  RIL-BP had in August 2013 won approval to invest up to USD 3.18 billion to produce gas for 13 years from D-34 (R- Series) discovery in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block.The planned output from D-34, which is estimated to hold an in-place reserve of 2.2 trillion cubic feet, more than double of the combined current production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3) gas field and MA field in the KG-D6 block.  RIL had originally put the recoverable reserves in D-34 at 1.413 Tcf that could produce a peak output of 14.9 mmscmd. However, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) trimmed the recoverable reserves to 1.191 Tcf and peak output to 12.9 mmscmd.  The Dhirubhai-34 or D-34 gas discovery in the southern part of KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin was notified in May 2007. The find was declared commercially viable by MC in November 2011.  RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries and one oil find in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D1 and D3 gas fields were brought to production in April 2009, while MA oilfield began pumping oil in September 2008.

But the agency has warned of higher borrowings by the country's richest and the most profitable company over the next 18 months to pay back its creditors for the large capex it had incurred on telecom and refining &amp;amp;amp; petchem expansion.  &amp;quot;Such payments along with additional capex towards telecom services will constrain any reduction in net borrowings until fiscal 2019,&amp;quot; it warned.  &amp;quot;We have revised our outlook on the domestic long-term issuer rating of RIL to stable from positive, while the outlook on the foreign currency senior unsecured rating is maintained at stable. The outlook on Reliance Holding US is also maintained at stable,&amp;quot; Moody's said in a note today.  &amp;quot;The rating affirmation at Baa2 reflects expectation that RIL's credit metrics will recover over the next 12-18 months and be better positioned for its ratings as it continues to increase its earnings from the recently completed and ongoing projects in the refining and petrochemical segments,&amp;quot; said Vikas Halan, vice-president and senior credit officer at Moody's.  The Baa2 ratings also reflects RIL's strong ability to generate operating cash flows, with annual EBITDA exceeding USD10 billion from its large-scale integrated refining and petrochemical operations with strong margins and its nascent but growing digital services business, he added.  &amp;quot;The change in the outlook on the Baa2 domestic issuer rating reflects the increase in RIL's business risks because of its growing digital services segment and our expectation that the high capital spending will keep its free cash flow negative over at least next 18 months,&amp;quot; said Halan, who is also Moody's lead analyst for the largest corporate entity in the country with a Rs 6 trillion market capitalisation.  He said though RIL's refining and petrochem capex is almost complete, cash outflow will still remain high as payments to creditors for the past capex are made over the next 12-18 months.  &amp;quot;Such payments along with additional capex towards telecom services will constrain any reduction in net borrowings until fiscal 2019.&amp;quot;  Retained cash flow adjusted to net debt improved to 16 percent in fiscal 2017 from about 14 percent in fiscal 2016, but remains weak for its ratings, Moody's said.

The partners yesterday submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) a field development plan (FDP) for the MJ-1 gas find, which is located about 2,000 meters directly below the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.  MJ-1 is estimated to hold a minimum of 0.988 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of contingent resource.  With this, RIL-BP have finalised investment plans totaling USD 5-5.5 billion (about Rs 33,000 crore to Rs 36,000 crore) for three sets of discoveries in the KG-D6 block.  Earlier this month, they submitted an FDP of USD 1.4 billion for bringing to production six satellite gas discoveries in the block.  RIL-BP combine had in 2013 submitted a USD 3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, sources said adding the actual investment in the find may actually be USD 1.4-1.6 billion only.  Sources said the investment in MJ-1 would be slightly higher because a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) will be used to produce the gas.  Work on the three sets of discoveries will start sometime in 2018 and contracting for equipment and services has already started.  In May 2013, RIL, BP and Niko Resources of Canada had struck a 155-metres thick gas condensate column in the exploration well KGD6-MJ1, which was later named as D55 or MJ-1 discovery.  MJ-1 is one of the three clusters that the partners are focusing on reviving the flagging output at KG-D6.  Besides MJ-1, four deep sea satellite gas discoveries &mdash; D-2, 6, 19 and 22 are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block. The investment in these satellite fields would be USD 1.4 billion.  The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find.  All the three sets of finds will produce 30 to 35 million standard cubic meters per day of gas, sources said.  RIL and BP had in mid-June this year announced investing Rs 40,000 crore in the three sets of finds to reverse the flagging production in KG-D6 block.  RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG&mdash;D6 block. Of these, D&mdash;1 and D&mdash;3 &mdash;&mdash; the largest among the lot &mdash;&mdash; were brought into production from April, 2009, but output has fallen sharply from 54 mmscmd in March, 2010, to 3-4 mmscmd.  MA is the only other field that was put to production. Together, the three fields today produce less than 6 mmscmd gas.  Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.  RIL is the operator of the block with 60 per cent interest while BP has 30 per cent stake. Niko has the remaining 10 per cent shares.

The official said a decision on the quantum of reduction hadn&rsquo;t yet been taken yet.,,"Business, Companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/trai-may-give-cos-fewer-days-to-interconnect-make-norms-stricter-more-transparent_9922261.html,"Dhirendra Tripathi  Moneycontrol News  The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is likely to cut down the number of days &ndash; currently 90 &ndash; a service provider gets to allow calls generated from another service provider&rsquo;s network to start terminating on its own, an official familiar with the development told Moneycontrol.  This change is part of the broader set of recommendations that the regulator is expected to frame on the subject of interconnection. The official said a decision on the quantum of reduction hadn&rsquo;t yet been taken yet.  The recommendations on the subject, expected to be issued in a fortnight or so, will be an amendment to the existing policy.&nbsp; The official said the new guidelines would aim to bring in more transparency and a level-playing field in the sector while cutting down scope for litigation.  The principle of interconnect is at the heart of a landline/mobile service since a call can start only when the service provider of the &lsquo;called party&rsquo; allows the service provider of the &lsquo;calling party&rsquo; to interconnect or terminate the call on its network. Unless there is an agreement between the two service providers on this, a person will not be able to call another user.  The issue of interconnect has always been a hotly contested issue in the Indian telecom sector, often used as a tool by the then incumbent to thwart competition. Most recently, Reliance Jio Infocomm found itself at the receiving end when incumbent operators did not provide enough interconnection to it at the time of launch of its services last year. This resulted in Reliance Jio customers&rsquo; calls to users of other companies not going through.  The Reliance Industries subsidiary was forced to approach the regulator to help resolve the issue. TRAI then found that these telecom companies weren't providing enough points of interconnect to the new entrant. It then recommended to the Department of Telecommunications to impose penalties of Rs 1,050 crore each on Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India and Rs 950 crore on Idea Cellular. The matter is sub judice now.  The physical part of the interconnect ecosystem works like this. A service provider first prepares an estimate of the number of subscribers it would have by a certain date. Based on that figure, it asks for points of interconnect from the other service provider to allow its own users to be able to call customers of the other operator. New requests for interconnect are made as and when fresh estimates of the number of users are made.  Based on the number of points of interconnect it wants the other company to release, the first company makes a payment to the other one which has 90 days from then on to issue the number of PoIs requested.  The issue of interconnect is of vital importance to TRAI since it lies at the heart of the regulator&rsquo;s most important objective of consumer interest. It comes under TRAI&rsquo;s quality of service rules. Maximum call failure rate permitted by the regulator is 0.5 percent. A call fails when the interconnection doesn&rsquo;t happen.  As opposed to data consumption, interconnect is more important for voice services as no such interconnection is needed to access data.

RIL-BP combine yesterday submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) a field development plan for what are known as satellite and other satellite fields, sources with direct knowledge of development said.  They plan to develop four deepsea satellite gas finds, named D-2, 6, 19 and 22, together with two other nearby finds, D-29 and D30, in the Krishna Godavari basin block.  In all, 5-6 gas producing wells will be drilled and tied to production facilities, they said adding peak output may be in the range of 10 to 12 million standard cubic meters per day.  The four satellites and the two other satellite finds (D29 and D30), R-Series and MJ gas discoveries, are the ones on which RIL and BP had in mid-June this year announced investing Rs 40,000 crore to reserve the flagging production from KG-D6 block.  Sources said development of the six satellite finds are being taken up together while D-34 or R-Series and D-55 (MJ) would have separate development plans.  The government had in 2012 approved a USD 1.529 billion plan to produce 10.36 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from four satellite fields of block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG&mdash;D6) by 2016-17.  The four fields have 617 billion cubic feet of reserves and can produce gas for eight years.  However, the companies did not begin the investment citing uncertainty over gas pricing.  Now that the government has allowed a higher gas price of USD 6.3 per million British thermal unit for yet-to-be- developed gas finds in difficult areas like the deepsea, RIL and BP have decided to take up their development.  This rate is comparable with USD 2.89 per mmBtu for currently producing fields.  Sources said these four finds are now been clubbed together with D29 and D30 discoveries, which had been held up over conformity tests.  RIL-BP combine does not plan to alter the USD 3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, which was approved in August 2013.  About 12.9 mmscmd of gas for 13 years can be produced from from D-34 discovery, which is estimated to hold recoverable reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet.  A separate development plan for the MJ find would be submitted by mid-2018, they said.  RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG&mdash;D6 block. Of these, D&mdash;1 and D&mdash;3 &mdash;&mdash; the largest among the lot &mdash;&mdash; were brought into production from April, 2009, but output has fallen sharply from 54 mmscmd in March, 2010, to 3-4 mmscmd.  MJ is the only other field that was put to production. Together, the three fields today produce 6.4 mmscmd.  Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.

One was the gross refining margin and the other was the losses in its telecom subsidiary Jio.  The company met market expectations on refining margins but positively surprised the market by posting a profit at the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) level in its telecom operations. Since its launch in September 2016, it was for the first time that Jio&rsquo;s financial numbers were made public.  Jio, a late entrant in the telecom space, took the sector by storm with tariff rates way below competition. The aggressive pricing helped the company build a customer base of 138.6 million users within a year.  Surprisingly, despite the aggressive pricing, Reliance has been able to post average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 156.4 as compared to Rs 154 of market leader Bharti Airtel. The management is confident of improving its ARPU further, which will help the company report profits sooner than most analysts expect.  For the September quarter, Jio reported revenues of Rs 6,147 crore and a marginal loss of Rs 270.59 crore. The company posted an operating profit of Rs 1,443 crore at an operating margin of 23.5 percent.  The numbers highlighted the changing dynamics of the telecom sector with data now taking center stage. Total wireless data traffic in Reliance Jio&rsquo;s network was 378 crore GB. High data usage in the Reliance Jio&rsquo;s network helped the country reach the highest per capita data consumption of 9.62 GB per user per month in the world. With 80 percent of the country&rsquo;s data capacity, a large chunk of the growth in per capita numbers can be attributed to Reliance Jio.  Jio&rsquo;s coverage area is likely to spread to 95 percent of the country&rsquo;s population by 2018, making its network greater than that of any 2G player in the country. As its reach spreads, Jio&rsquo;s revenues are expected to increase further with a corresponding increase in ARPU driven by value-added services.  The drop in interconnect usage charges (IUC) and a substantial improvement in its service quality with less than 0.4 percent call drops are likely to boost Reliance Jio&rsquo;s numbers, according to analysts. The company has announced bookings of JioPhone, which were stopped earlier because of unprecedented demand that will add to its subscriber base.  Analysts have started upgrading their earnings estimates after seeing the first set of numbers this quarter. With value-added services and products expected to be launched in future and Reliance Jio&rsquo;s numbers will continue to be the most awaited one among Reliance Industries different business.

Numbers except bottomline beat analysts&rsquo; expectations.  Revenue from operations grew 5 percent sequentially and 16.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 95,085 crore in second quarter of FY18, driven by growth across segments - petrochemical, refining, organised retail and digital businesses.  &amp;quot;Another quarter of robust performance includes the financial performance of Reliance Jio which had a positive EBIT contribution in its first quarter of commercial operations,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries said.  The results also reflected strong underlying fundamentals of refining and petrochemicals businesses, he added.  Brokerages are largely upbeat about the core and operational performance and pin hopes on telecom business to turn profitable soon. Further, they also expect increase in GRMs as well.  Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,080  The research firm highlighted that the company had in line core performance but was a miss on PAT due to high tax rate. It estimates Jio to be profit making from the very first year, while EPS estimates for FY18/19/20 will rise 25/16/12 percent.

Brokerage: Edelweiss | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 1,104  Edelweiss highlighted that the company&rsquo;s strong operative competitiveness and healthy consumer traction enhance its conviction. Further, commissioning of Grandiose USD 20 billion core projects could bolster earnings.

With this, the oil-to-telecom conglomerate is left with no conventional oil and gas property overseas. It has just two shale gas assets in the US.  Earlier this month, it sold one of the three shale oil and gas blocks it had in the United States for USD 126 million, a third of the price it paid seven years ago.  RIL held stakes in three US shale gas ventures - 45 percent with Pioneer Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford shale play; 40 percent with Chevron and 60 percent with Carrizo Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas in the Marcellus Shale play.  &amp;quot;Reliance signed agreements to divest all of its interest in the upstream shale gas assets operated by Carrizo,&amp;quot; it said in the presentation. &amp;quot;Transaction is expected to close by the end of 3Q FY18.&amp;quot;  The billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led firm had in 2007 set up Reliance Exploration and Production (REP) DMCC primarily for acquiring overseas assets.  It had steadily acquired 16 conventional oil and gas assets, including four in Peru, three in Yemen (one producing and two exploratories), two each in Oman, Kurdistan and Colombia and one each in East Timor and Australia. It last bagged two oil and gas exploration blocks in Myanmar in 2014.  But the company slowly exited most of its international assets.  It last withdrew from Block 39 in Peru. RIL held 10 percent interest in the block. Anglo-French oil and gas company Perenco held 55 percent stake in the block while PetroVietnam of Vietnam held the remaining 35 percent.  The Myanmar exploration blocks were awarded to RIL in March 2015. It held 96 percent stake in each of the two blocks with the remaining 4 percent being with a local company.  RIL's domestic oil and gas business portfolio, which at one point of time comprised of 42 blocks or fields, has shrunk to five conventional oil and gas assets and two coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks.  As part of its upstream (hydrocarbons exploration and production) portfolio rationalisation, the company has been exiting those assets which it feels are not going to give a good return on investment.  According to RIL's latest annual report, the company's present domestic portfolio comprises the flagging KG-D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin, Mahanadi basin block of NEC-25, CB-10 in Cambay and GS-01 in Saurashtra basin.  Besides, it also has a stake in Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea. However, Mid and South Tapti fields have been abandoned after production tapered.  Also, it has two CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh.  RIL had in February 2011 announced a &amp;quot;transformational&amp;quot; deal when UK's BP picked up 30 percent stake in its 23 oil and gas blocks for USD 7.2 billion. However, in August that year, the government allowed them to form a partnership in only 21 blocks.  Since 2012, RIL and BP have been pruning their portfolio, shedding not so viable acreage. They are now left with just three blocks - the producing KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal, gas discovery areas of NEC-OSN-97/2 (NEC-25) and CB-ONN-2003/1 in Cambay basin.

Numbers except bottomline beat analysts&rsquo; expectations.  Revenue from operations grew 5 percent sequentially and 16.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 95,085 crore in second quarter of FY18, driven by growth across segments - petrochemical, refining, organised retail and digital businesses.  &amp;quot;Another quarter of robust performance includes the financial performance of Reliance Jio which had a positive EBIT contribution in its first quarter of commercial operations,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries said.  The results also reflected strong underlying fundamentals of refining and petrochemicals businesses, he added.

Apart from its oil business, the street closely looks at its digital business, which analysts expect it show better performance going ahead.  Ambani said the strong financial results of Jio demonstrated the robust business model of Jio and the significant efficiencies that the company has built through its investment in the latest 4G technology and right business strategy.  Reliance Jio has posted a net loss of Rs 270.6 crore in July-September quarter against loss of Rs 21.3 crore in June quarter, which was much lower than analysts&rsquo; estimates that were at around Rs 2,000 crore.

Meanwhile, retail business showed a whopping growth of 26.6 percent QoQ and 81.3 percent YoY at Rs 14,646 crore for September quarter, with EBIT growing 14.4 percent QoQ and 106.2 percent YoY at Rs 334 crore. The growth was driven by digital, fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle and petroleum products.

On standalone basis, Reliance's profit increased 0.8 percent sequentially to Rs 8,265 crore and revenue rose 1.9 percent to Rs 71,761 crore in Q2.

Finance cost more than doubled sequentially to Rs 2,272 crore from Rs 1,119 crore due to finance cost related to digital services business.  Reliance said capital expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 15,653 crore, which was principally on account of ongoing projects in petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar and digital services business.

The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas major will declare results post market hours.  Consolidated profit is expected to be at Rs 8,169 crore for the quarter against Rs 9,079 crore in previous quarter. According to an average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBIDTA) is likely to be strong at Rs 13,178 crore, compared with Rs 12,554 crore in June quarter.  Edelweiss Securities expect a robust Q2FY18 performance for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas sector, following an operationally strong Q1FY18. For RIL, strong refining will be somewhat offset by subdued polyester spreads.  However, the ramp‐up in new capacities and benefit of ethane imports will buoy earnings. It estimates a strong quarter with standalone PAT of Rs8800 crore, up 7 percent QoQ. The GRM could surprise D-Street at USD 12.4/bbl (up 4% QoQ), a USD4/bbl premium over Singapore benchmark.  After witnessing the breakout of 8 years consolidation (from September 2008 till December 2016) between Rs560 to Rs340 levels, the stock has been in an uptrend across all the time frames.  The stock has been in an uptrend throughout 2017, thanks to optimism around its telecom venture, Jio and a sharp improvement in refining margins. RIL gained over 60 percent so far in the year 2017, compared to 20 percent rally in the S&amp;amp;amp;P BSE Sensex.  However, since the last three months, the stock has undergone a consolidation phase wherein the prices have traded in a broad range of Rs870-760. This consolidation phase seems to be a time-correction in the prices, suggest experts.  &ldquo;Chart pattern indicates that if the stock faces any profit booking, it may find support around Rs 770-760 levels; however, any breakdown below Rs 760 would accelerate the selling in stock which may drag it towards Rs 723-710 in short-term,&rdquo; Rajesh Palviya, Head Technical &amp;amp;amp; Derivative Analyst, Axis Securities Ltd told Moneycontrol.  However, if stock observes breakout from its consolidation range (Rs 870-760) then it is likely to scale towards 930-950 levels in short to medium term, he said.  The past behavior of stock for the last 5-6 quarters suggest profit booking post result outcome (last quarter was exceptional). The corrective action generally comes in the range of 7-10% percent after result outcome.  Palviya further added that post-correction of 15-20 days the stock bottoms out and demonstrated strong recovery and witnessed around 20-30% percent gain from the bottom made after results in 1-2 months.  It took RIL 8-10 years to replicate its massive outperformance that we saw in the calendar year 2007. Most of the investors trapped then had to undergo massive time-wise pain, but now it looks like the pain is over and investors should eye big gains.  RIL is in a strong bull run and investors who should hold onto the stock for bigger gains. It is one stock which should be part if your portfolio and any dips should be used as a buying opportunity.  &ldquo;If we consider its ex-bonus price, a multi-year breakout point was around the 550 mark. The moment this stock surpassed this hurdle on a sustainable basis, we witnessed a beginning of strong &lsquo;Bull Run&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd told Moneycontrol.  &ldquo;Considering the broader picture, there is no second thought whether the stock should be held in the portfolio or not. There is still a long way to go from here for this counter, but this will happen with a time,&rdquo; he said.  We have collated a list of views from different experts on how to trade RIL ahead of results:  Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist &ndash; Technical Research &amp;amp;amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in  After multi-year underperformance, this counter successfully aligned itself with the bull market frenzy as it broken out of a multi-year triangular formation couple of months back.  Short term trading bets or even fresh positional longs should be considered only when this counter trades above Rs862 levels on closing basis in post result sessions.  Any sell-off in this counter owing to weakness either in broader markets or disappointment on result front shall drag it down towards critical supports placed in the zone of Rs818 &ndash; 810 where long-term investors can enter.  Analyst: Arpit Jain, AVP at Arihant Capital Markets  The stock is showing some accumulation pattern on the longer term chart. Further, the weekly chart is still maintaining Higher &ndash; top Higher &ndash;bottom formation which is a sign of strength.  The momentum indicators are positively poised. There strong demand at 800 &ndash; 780 levels. Hence one should hold the stock with a stop loss 779 for a target of 930 &ndash; 980 levels in a couple of weeks.  Analyst: Pragnesh Jain, AVP Technical Research - Institutional Equities, Systematix shares  The key resistance level is placed at Rs875 which can act as a hurdle. A breakout above Rs875 is required for further up-move after which it can extend upside to the extent of 915-930 zone where traders can look to book profits.  Failure to breakout and sustain above Rs875 can see it slip back till Rs820-795 levels. Overall strong as long as 780 holds.  Analyst: Rajesh Palviya, Head Technical &amp;amp;amp; Derivative Analyst, Axis Securities Ltd.  Trading Strategy 1:&nbsp;Buy on a breakout  The stock is in process of forming a Rectangular Pattern on the weekly chart and shown V shape recovery on daily chart in recent past, so if it manages to break out above Rs 870-875 one can buy the stock from a near-term trading perspective with a target of Rs 920-935 and stop-loss of Rs 845  Trading Strategy 2:&nbsp;Buy on dips  Looking at the behavior of stock it corrects around 8-10% after results in next 10-15 days (only last quarter was exception), if the stock reacts negatively one can look for buying it around Rs 790-770 levels with a final stop-loss of Rs 740 to play for a pullback action with a target of Rs 870-880 in 1-2 months&rsquo; time frame.  Trading Strategy 3:&nbsp;Short Sell if breaks below 835  Looking at the near term chart reliance is having immediate support of 835 if stock breaks below 835 one can go short in stock with stop loss of 855 for lower side target of 790-770 in near/short term basis.  Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd.  As far as its activity around the &lsquo;Quarterly Result&rsquo; is concerned, there has been mixed reactions on 2 out 3 previous occasions. There is not much symmetry to think about.  At present, the stock prices are trading way above its low (680.45) made after last &lsquo;Quarterly Result&rsquo; day and is still going strong as we saw the stock clocking fresh record high today.  Investors can wait for dips to come or some kind of consolidation to happen and that&rsquo;s the only option left for them. As far as momentum traders are concerned, Thursday&rsquo;s close of Rs838 was quite encouraging and the stock may continue this rally in the near term.

So, broker dealers and all these other stocks which are having their own independent rallies, they are likely to continue. However, overall the large public sector banks are making new lows.

Under Modi, the world's third-biggest oil consumer is trying to use its market size to strike better deals with oil exporters and attract investment into India's exploration and refining industries.  Executives from companies including Rosneft, BP, Exxon Mobil, Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell, Vedanta, Schlumberger and Halliburton met Modi as the industry gathered in New Delhi for the three-day India Energy Forum, which finishes on Tuesday.  &amp;quot;Participants appreciated the pace and drive with which Prime Minister Modi has brought about reform in the energy sector,&amp;quot; Modi's office said in a statement after the meeting.  &amp;quot;Subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy, contract frameworks and arrangements, requirement of seismic data sets, encouragement for biofuels, improving gas supply, setting up of a gas hub and regulatory issues came up for discussion.&amp;quot;  The statement said that many suggestions at the last meeting in 2016 have helped guide Indian policy-making and that Modi said he appreciated the &amp;quot;focused suggestions&amp;quot; made this year and that &amp;quot;scope for reform in many areas still exists&amp;quot;.  Modi was quoted as saying he looked forward to &amp;quot;various opportunities&amp;quot; for cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia, the second biggest oil exporter to the country behind Iraq.  State-run Saudi Aramco, which on Sunday launched a new office near New Delhi, is in talks with several Indian refiners for a possible joint venture by next year.  Its Chief Executive Amin Nasser told the conference after the Modi meeting that India's oil demand would double by 2040 to about 10 million barrels per day, making it the world's largest market for the fuel and a priority for the company.  In the meeting, Modi thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rosneft for their support to India's energy sector. The two leaders were instrumental in helping to seal Rosneft's $12.9 billion acquisition of India's debt-laden Essar Oil, strengthening ties between the world's largest oil producer and the fastest-growing fuel consumer.  In another vote of confidence for India's energy sector, BP and Reliance have previously said they would jointly invest $6 billion to boost India's gas output. A BP executive said on Monday that the company was &amp;quot;excited about gas, upstream and digital innovation in India&amp;quot;.  Alay Patel, a senior analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the global president of which also met Modi, said that India's domestic energy production outlook was positive thanks to steps such as a simplified licensing regime and clarity on contracts.  &amp;quot;But more is needed,&amp;quot; said Patel. &amp;quot;Allowing marketing and pricing freedom for all gas production, regardless of shore status and contract vintage would incentivise companies to develop gas in the less explored basins.&amp;quot;"

The main theme of the meeting, sources said, was to seek investment in exploration and production, processing, transportation and distribution network in oil and gas.  The Niti Aayog made a short presentation on the status, the likely scenario of demand and supply by 2030 and current government policies.  This is the second meeting Prime Minister had with CEOs of oil majors.  His first meeting was in January 2016 where suggestions for reforming natural gas prices were made. More than a year later, the government allowed higher natural gas price for yet-to-be-produced fields in difficult areas like deep sea.  The government is looking at private investment to raise domestic oil and gas production, which has stagnated for the last few years while fuel demand has been rising by 5-6 per cent annually.  India is dependent on imports to meet its 80 per cent of the demand and more than half of its natural gas requirements.  The prime minister in 2015 had set a target of reducing India's oil dependence by 10 per cent to 67 per cent (based on import dependence of 77 per cent in 2014-15) by 2022.  Import dependence has only increased since then and the government is now looking for ways to raise domestic output.  OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also attended the meeting. Former oil secretaries Vivek Rae and Vijay Kelkar were also invited for the meeting.  Pradhan told the gathering that the liberalised India offers around USD 300 billion investment opportunity in the next 10 years in the oil and gas sector.  &amp;quot;We want investors, both domestic and global, who can bring in the best technology and capital,&amp;quot; he said.  The government is devising policies to increase share of gas in the energy basket to 15 per cent from 7 per cent.  &amp;quot;We are planning a gas trading exchange and making sure there is open access to the gas grid. Global experience in this area would be useful,&amp;quot; he stated.  According to Pradhan, in the last 40 months, the government has taken several policy initiatives in the energy sector in line with the prime minister's vision of energy access, efficiency, sustainability and security.  Also present at the meeting were ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh, GAIL India head B C Tripathi, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) Chairman Mukesh Kumar Suran, Oil India Chairman Utpal Bora and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) Chairman D Rajkumar."

The 1HFY18 is over and the S&amp;amp;amp;P BSE Sensex rose just over 6 percent and for the year it has gained a little over 18 percent. Where do you see the markets headed in the next 6 months of this fiscal year?  The 1HFY18 was historical as Nifty touched the 10,000 mark in July 2017. The first half of the financial year was almost on expected lines.  But, the second half will see a lot of challenges for the market with regards to geopolitical tensions, uncertainty on the domestic macroeconomic front, and strong economic vibes emanating from the US which could turn the flow of capital away from emerging markets. We believe that 2HFY18 will see markets trading in a range with high volatility.  Your list of top five stocks which could turn multibaggers in the next 2-3 years?  Top five stocks which could turn multibaggers include stocks like Hindustan Unilever, Petronet LNG, Maruti Suzuki, NBCC &amp;amp;amp; Reliance Industries Ltd.  Hindustan Unilever  In Q1FY2018, Hindustan Unilever Limited&rsquo;s (HUL) revenue and PAT grew by 5 percent on a YoY basis and 15 percent on a YoY basis, respectively, beating Street&rsquo;s expectations for the quarter.  Sharekhan has already revised their earning estimates upwards for FY18 and FY19 by 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, to factor in better-than-expected operating performance.  The company is banking on operating efficiencies through various initiatives and cost-saving activities at the supply-chain/distribution level to see a gradual improvement in OPM.  Petronet LNG (PLNG)  Rebound in LNG imports and shutdown of Dabhol LNG terminal during the monsoon to improve PLNG&rsquo;s Dahej terminal utilization in Q2FY18. Sharekhan expects PLNG to be a key beneficiary of the rising share of LNG imports in India&rsquo;s overall gas consumption due to the following factors:  1) Flat to a marginal increase in the domestic gas production outlook over FY18E-FY20E and, 2) Low competition in LNG market as only two new LNG terminals - 5mmt Mundra terminal and 5mmt Ennore terminal is expected to come on-stream over FY18E-FY20E.  The stock is trading at an attractive valuation of 14.9x FY19E EPS given the strong earnings growth outlook (15 percent CAGR over FY17-2019E) and resilient RoE of 22-23 percent.  Maruti Suzuki  Maruti Suzuki India (Maruti) is India&rsquo;s largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer with a strong 47 percent market share. Over the past two years, the company has been able to gain market share due to new product launches, a vast distribution network (with an increased focus on rural markets) and a shift in consumer preference to petrol models from diesel models.  Maruti has successfully established itself in the big car category (Ciaz, Vitara Brezza, Dzire, and Baleno), led by strong product features and success of its premium distribution network Nexa, which offers a unique buying experience. Maruti continues to remain our top bet in the automotive space, given the sustained trend of outpacing the PV industry&rsquo;s growth.  Reliance Industries  Sharekhan expects Reliance Industries's (RIL) GRM to remain strong at USD 11.5/12.0 per bbl in FY18/FY19, given the robust global oil demand growth outlook for 2017 at 1.5mbpd (International Energy Agency estimate).  Moreover, a likely improvement in diesel cracks would help RIL to maintain a premium of USD 4bbl-5/ bbl over Singapore Complex GRM. Ethylene margin is also expected to remain firm at USD 600-650/mt, led by healthy demand and likely delay in the commissioning of incremental capacities in CY2018.  It expects EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 23 percent/12 percent over FY17-FY19E, driven by the commissioning of core downstream projects in FY18. Any positive surprise in terms of better-than-expected financials of the telecom business would be an important re-rating trigger for RIL going forward.  NBCC  Sharekhan marginally tweaked its earnings estimates on account of strong order inflow guidance and margin expansion despite flat topline in Q1. NBCC is likely to deliver an earnings CAGR of 51 percent during FY17-FY19E.  The positive outlook on revenue guidance for the next two years is on account of revenue booking to kick-start from large projects of Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar, and Sarojini Nagar. Backed by strong earnings visibility, a lean balance sheet, high return ratios and its quasi-monopoly position.  Slipping macros is something which is troubling market participants at the current juncture. Do you think this will cap the upside for Indian markets or are these fears unfounded?  If the slipping macros do not see signs of improvement especially with regards to taxation reforms (GST) then markets will have strong reasons to correct till things are well in place for the next leg of up-move.  What is your call on the rupee? Do you see it heading towards Rs 70/USD in near term?  If domestic macro factors do not improve and the US keeps its pace of improvement on the economic front, then we can see some migration of capital or fund flows from India and other emerging markets (EMs), which can result in high demand for US dollars resulting in the currency (rupee) touching the mentioned levels.  September quarter earnings will kick off from the next month. Do you expect a recovery in earnings in this quarter?  We expect certain pockets to do well this quarter. E.g. metals, auto, private banks. Till date, there are no strong hints of broader economic activity pick up; hence, there are reasons to believe that broader earnings will continue to remain subdued and below par.  What is pushing foreign investors away from Indian markets? They have sold over Rs 20,000 crore in Indian equity markets in September (provisional).  As mentioned above deteriorating domestic macro factors and no revival of earnings are driving the FIIs into other markets. This trend may continue in the near-term.  Top sectors which will lead the next leg of the rally on India markets?  Financials, automobiles, consumer discretionary &amp;amp;amp; rural franchise.

",,"Business, Economy, shale oil",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/why-india39s-importus-shale-oil-isbig-deal_9805541.html,"Shishir Asthana Moneycontrol Research  As the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) docked at Paradip Port in Odisha on Monday to unload its 1.6 million barrels of shale oil, history was created. This was the first time since the US allowed exports of its oil after a ban of 40 years that it has&nbsp;supplied to India. But the move is significant in many other ways than just the symbolism attached to it.  India and other Asian countries were dependent to a large extent on&nbsp;oil production in west Asia by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Because of the proximity to Asian economies, these OPEC countries charged a premium for the oil they supplied.  Taking into account that the cost of transportation from any other major oil producing countries would be prohibitive, OPEC countries got away with this. India has been raising the issue of the premium with OPEC countries over the last three years. Being the third-largest oil consumer, India demanded at a meeting of OPEC members and non-members that the premium be removed. The minister of petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, said at the meeting that the global oil industry stood at a delicate crossroads and that any attempt to frustrate or assign lower importance to Indian demand would be detrimental to the suppliers.   Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices Works   While the OPEC nations were still deliberating on the action to be taken, India moved ahead by ordering its first consignment of 2 million barrels of shale oil for around USD 100 million. This move again was not just symbolic in order to put pressure on the OPEC countries, but it made economic sense, too.  As the cartel of OPEC nations was trying to keep oil prices higher by deliberately cutting production, US oil fields were firing on all cylinders. As a result of higher supply, the spread between Dubai Oil and those from Brent and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) fields fell in favour of the western oil fields. This made importing oil from the US cheaper than those from west Asia.  The government played an important role in bringing transportation costs down as it eased restrictions on importing oil compulsorily through ships owned by Indian companies. Using a VLCC to transport oil reduced the cost of transportation and made the decision economically viable.  The refiner, in this case, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), benefited not only from the lower price of crude but also from a better quality of the oil. Shale oil, also known as tight oil, gives the best yield for the most lucrative middle distillates. In other words, the gross refining margins (GRM) of refineries will improve if the shale oil is used. Little wonder then that Reliance Industries too has booked 1 million barrels of WTI and Eagle Ford crude each.  Finally, the geopolitical benefit that India gains by purchasing US crude also needs to be taken into account. The deal to buy US oil was struck in a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump. For India, importing crude oil also helps in bringing down the USD 24-billion trade deficit which Trump has been pointing to in his attack on India&rsquo;s impact on US jobs.  In the context of around 1,500 million barrels of oil imported by India, the present import is too small to move the needle, but it is surely going to turn heads in the OPEC world as the cartel struggles to find new markets and environmental awareness puts pressure on oil demand.

Reliance, the owner of the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar, is joining state-run refiners Indian Oil Corp , Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp in importing US crude. The purchase illustrates the vast reach of U.S. oil exports since the government rescinded a decades-long ban at the end of 2015.  For this purchase, Reliance bought 1 million barrels of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland and a similar-sized cargo of Eagle Ford crude, both of which are expected to arrive in November, the sources said.  U.S. producer Occidental Petroleum Corp sold the WTI Midland cargo, they said.  Reliance did not respond to Reuters' email seeking comments.  There was also no reply to an emailed request for comment from Occidental sent outside of U.S. business hours.  Opportunities for Indian refiners to import more U.S. crude increased after the discount for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for U.S. crude, to global benchmark Brent stretched to its widest since 2015 during September.   Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices Works   State-run Indian refiners have bought a total 7.85 million barrels of oil from the United States so far.  India's imports of U.S. oil follows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington in June when President Donald Trump said his country looked forward to exporting more energy products to India.  On Monday, Indian Oil, the country's top refiner, received its parcel of the U.S. crude at the eastern port of Paradip, the company said in a statement.  Including the U.S. as a source for crude imports for refiners will go a long way in mitigating the risk arising from geo-political disruptions, Sanjay Sudhir, the joint secretary for international cooperation at the oil ministry, said in the Indian Oil statement.  U.S. crude oil shipments to India have the potential to boost bilateral trade by up to $2 billion, the U.S. embassy in India said in a statement on Monday.

In May, RIL had become the first buyer of gas it produced from its own coal bed methane (CBM) block in Madhya Pradesh after agreeing to pay the highest price of USD 4.23 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for May-June.  In the following quarter, it paid an additional 6 per cent at USD 4.50 per mmBtu to take all of the CBM gas from Sohagpur East and Sohagpur West blocks.  In the latest bidding for up to 3 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of gas to be produced during October 2017 and March 2021, RIL quoted USD 6.26 per mmBtu at the current oil price, according to bid documents.  Piramal Glass was the second-highest bidder quoting USD 4.97 per mmBtu, followed by Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GPSC) putting in a bid of USD 4.9.  GAIL bid for 1.5 mmscmd of gas at a price of USD 4.63 per mmBtu while its subsidiary GAIL Gas sought an equivalent quantity at USD 4.11 per mmBtu price, the bid document showed.  RIL plans to use the gas at its petrochemical plants in Gujarat and Maharashtra, which run mostly on expensive imported fuel.  Its petrochemical plants at Patalganga and Nagothane in Maharashtra and Vadodara and Jamnagar in Gujarat consumed an average of 4 mmscmd of gas during the last three months.  RIL started commercial gas production from the CBM blocks in March and the planned output in October is 0.8 mmscmd, according to the bid document.  Output would be ramped up to 2 mmscmd by March 2018 while the peak production of 3 mmscmd would touch in the third quarter of 2018.  The rate of CBM gas is 150 per cent more than the government mandated USD 2.48 per mmBtu price of the conventional natural gas produced by firms such as ONGC and RIL from the eastern offshore KG-D6 block.  The bidding formula in all the three bid rounds for CBM gas this year has been the same and the process has been conducted by Crisil Risk and Infrastructure Solutions, a unit of Crisil.  This formula is almost similar to the one RIL had run in 2012 to discover a price for CBM gas. Back in 2012, it had sought bids for 3.5 mmscmd of coal gas at the benchmarked rate of 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu.  The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.  At USD 100 per barrel oil price prevalent that year, CBM from RIL's Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. At USD 58 a barrel rate currently, it would have cost USD 7.3. That formula was, however, rejected by the ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.  In the current price discovery, RIL sought bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.52 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, according to the bid document.  RIL bid deducting USD 1.836 per mmBtu and Piramal Glass USD 3.156. GAIL quoted a deduction of USD 3.495. RIL has invested about USD 500 million in CBM and laying a 300-km pipeline from Sohagpur to Phulpur in Uttar Pradesh to connect to the national gas grid.  Through an April 13 notification, the oil ministry had stated that a CBM producer had to call for open bids for sale of coal gas and seek quotes to discover the market price.

Coal India Ltd, the world's largest coal producer, was the only Indian firm to have slipped in the ranking - 45 in 2017, down from 38 in last year.  The other Indian firms in the ranking included Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (39), Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (48), Power Grid Corp (81) and GAIL India Ltd (106).

Over the last two sessions, the index is seen marking time above Monday&rsquo;s bullish gap area and the breakout area of August 2017 high.  The Nifty behaved precisely in line with our expectations and conquered the previous life-time high of 10,137. Going forward, we expect the index to remain on a rising trajectory and head towards a target of 10,400 in coming weeks.  The market has absorbed persistently flaring up geopolitical tensions and FII outflows while forming a higher base at the lower band of the expanding channel during the recent corrective phase in August 2017.  The price wise equality with last rising segment from 9,448 to 10,137 (689 points) measured from a recent trough of 9,685 projects upside towards 10,400 regions.  The placement of upper band of expanding channel currently placed near 10400 makes this the likely target for the current up move.  The key highlight during the recent consolidation phase has been the strong outperformance of broader markets. The NSE midcap and small-cap indices have rallied 12% and 16%, respectively, from their August lows and hit new highs ahead of the benchmark.  Going forward, we expect the benchmark to catch up with the broader markets and extend the ongoing up move with banking, auto, and capital goods sector leading the current up move.  We believe the immediate support base for the index has shifted upwards to 9900 regions being the confluence of lower band of the expanding channel in place since April 2017 and the value of rising 50 days EMA currently placed at 9900 levels.  Here is a list of top five stocks which could give up to 21% upside in 6 months:  Reliance Industries: BUY| Target Rs942| Stop Loss Rs798| upside 11%| Time Frame 6 month  The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas space has emerged as the major dark horse in the market wide up move over the last one year. The sector which had remained a prominent laggard since the downturn of 2008 has witnessed change fortunes and is back on investors&rsquo; radar as it has actively participated in the ongoing up move.  The BSE oil &amp;amp;amp; gas index rose to an all-time high in April 2017. The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas behemoth Reliance Industries has also witnessed a major turnaround in long-term price structure as it has catapulted past its previous lifetime high of |820 (adjusted for bonus) after a gap of nine long years.  After testing the previous life high in August 2017, the stock consolidated below the same over last one month. We believe this higher base building process has acted as a launch pad for the eventual thrust past the previous life high.  The share price has emerged out of long-term hibernation by decisively conquering its 2008 life high of |820 in the current month thereby triggering a bullish structural turnaround on the long-term price chart.  The entire up move since January 2017 till date has occurred in a well-defined rising channel highlighting a structured up move and sustained demand at elevated levels. The stock took support at the lower band of this rising channel during the August consolidation.  The up move in the current week has seen the stock register a breakout from one-month consolidation and in the process decisively closed above its 2008 highs. We believe the stock has concluded its long-term consolidation phase and is set to embark upon its fresh uptrend and offers good investment opportunity from a medium-term horizon.  We expect the stock to enter into a sustainable uptrend and head towards Rs944 over the medium term. The price wise equality with the last rising segment (Rs643 to 827 = 184 points) added to the base of August 2017 consolidation (760+184=944) projects upside towards Rs944 for the current up move over the medium term.

Punjab National Bank: BUY| Target Rs170| Stop Loss Rs129| Upside 19%| Time Frame Six months  The share price of PNB is attractively poised near the key value area providing a good entry opportunity with favourable risk/reward from a medium-term perspective. The corrective decline from 52 weeks high of Rs185 in May 2017 got anchored near the key value area of Rs135 in June 2017.  The stock bounced back to Rs164 level in July 2017 before once again revisiting the support zone in August 2017. Over the last five weeks the stock is undergoing a base formation precisely above the key value area of Rs135 which is the confluence of following:  The lower band of rising channel marking equality with November-December 2016 fall is placed at Rs135. Rising 52 week EMA is currently placed around Rs142, 61.8% retracement of the last rising segment is also placed around Rs139 levels.  The two distinct lows formed in June and August 2017 near Rs135 levels represents a bullish Double Bottom formation precisely at the major value area.  It indicates steady demand emerging above the key support zone ahead of the impending reversal on the price front. The base formation over the last five weeks has laid the foundation for the next up move.  Therefore, we believe the stock is attractively poised above its key value area and offers good buying opportunity with a favourable risk/reward to ride the next up move over the medium term  We expect the stock to resolve higher from here on and retrace the May-June 2017 decline by at least 80 percent over the coming month thereby providing upside towards Rs175 region over the medium term horizon.  Asian Granito: BUY| Target Rs615| Stop Loss Rs457| Upside 21%| Time Frame 6 months  The share price of Asian Granito India has remained in a secular uptrend since May 2014 as it continues to form a higher peak and higher trough in all time frames.  Within this structural uptrend, the stock has undergone periodic phases of consolidation providing fresh entry opportunities for investors to ride the uptrend.  We believe the sideways consolidation over the last 10 weeks has approached maturity and the stock provides a good entry opportunity with a favourable reward/risk set up for medium-term investors to ride the next up move within the larger uptrend.  The stock witnessed a strong rally in June-July 2017 rallying from a low of Rs333 to its all-time high of Rs500 in just 7 weeks. Thereafter, the sideways consolidation over last ten week has taken the pictorial shape of a bullish rounding formation as highlighted in the adjoining weekly chart.  The stock is currently at the cusp of the rounding pattern breakout thus offers fresh entry opportunity to ride the next up move in the stock  The key observation of price action reveals that the rallies since March 2017 has become bigger in magnitude than the preceding up move as the up move during June 2017 from Rs 333 to Rs500 (Rs500-333=167 points) was bigger in magnitude than the preceding rally of March 2017 (| 277-392=115 points).  On a similar basis, the current rally from August 2017 low of Rs380 is likely to be larger in magnitude than the preceding up move of 167 points. The price rallies getting bigger and swifter is a hallmark of the bull phase and corroborates the bullish view on the stock.  We expect the stock to continue with its current uptrend and head towards Rs620 in the medium term as it is the measuring implication of the rounding formation being the width of the pattern ( 500-380=120 points) added to the neckline of the rounding formation thus projects upside towards Rs620  Oberoi Realty: BUY| Target Rs615| Stop Loss Rs402| Return 10% Time Frame 6 months  The most prominent pattern on the weekly chart of Oberoi Realty is the breakout from Bullish Triangular consolidation pattern, which triggers fresh upward momentum and offers the opportunity to ride the next up leg.  The share price has remained in a sustained uptrend as marked by rising peak and trough formation and one of the outperforming stocks within realty space. The recent consolidation post-May 2017 peak of| 416 is anchored upon long-term 52-week EMA and took the form of a bullish triangular continuation pattern.  In early September, the share price broke out of this triangular pattern (Rs416-335). A subsequent retest of the breakout (Rs395) during last week, in the form of incremental buying support, corroborates the breakout and, thus, the bullish stance.  We have projected the target of Rs466 over the next three months based on pattern implication of the Triangle continuation pattern. The range of largest leg of Triangle (416-335=81 points) as projected from the breakout level of | 395 (395+81=476) is projected at Rs 476  Disclaimer: The author is Head Technical, AVP at ICICI Direct.com Research.

",,"Business, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance-plans-major-expansion-at-world39s-largest-oil-refinery-complex-sources_9718061.html,"The Reliance Industries, operator of the world's largest refining complex, is considering expanding its oil processing capacity by over 40 percent by 2030, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  Reliance may expand the capacity at its dual refinery complex in Jamnagar in Gujarat by 30 million tonnes a year to 100 million tonnes per year, according to the sources, who saw the expansion plans in a presentation by the company on potential energy scenarios to 2030.  Reliance made the presentation to India's Center for High Technology (CHT), a unit of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that evaluates projects and assesses their technological requirements.  The plans signal that Reliance remains bullish on the outlook for India's fuel demand even as the government is considering plans to electrify all of the country's vehicles by 2032. Still, India's demand for diesel and gasoline to power existing and expecting combustion engine vehicles will likely remain strong as its population grows and becomes more wealthy.  &amp;quot;The plan to is to have petrol and diesel output capacity of close to 60 million tonnes by 2030, produced from cheaper heavy grades,&amp;quot; said one of the sources.  Reliance did not respond to an emailed request for a comment on the possible expansion.  Reliance operates two refineries at the Jamnagar complex with an installed capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), or 60 million tonnes per year.  The plants typically operate above their installed capacity and process 1.4 million bpd of crude, or about 70 million tonnes per year. The refineries are among the most complex in the world and have facilities that can maximize the production of diesel and gasoline from so-called heavy, or higher density, crude oil that typically sells for less than other crude grades.  Raising the refining capacity at the Jamnagar complex to 100 million tonnes per year would equal about 2 million bpd.  The expansion makes sense in light of forecasts for strong fuel demand growth in the country, the world's third-biggest oil consumer. Consultant FGE estimates India's fuel demand to rise to 6.5 million bpd in 2030 from an estimated 4.2 million bpd in 2017.  Although, Reliance has not yet prepared a blueprint for the expansion and details of the costs are yet to be worked out, it would require around USD 10 billion to complete the plan, said the one source.  In 2014, Reuters reported that Reliance was planning a 400,000 bpd expansion at the Jamnagar site. That plan is yet to be approved by the environment ministry, according to the ministry website.

So, I think easily Rs 235-240 looks likely. Also, Motherson Sumi is coming out of a correction. It is not often that these stocks tend to correct, but definitely with a stop loss say around Rs 300, I think once we get past Rs 340, Rs 375-380 should be possible. So, anytime a market rally starts, I think both these stocks should outperform.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Bharat Forge&nbsp;and Motherson Sumi seem to have bottomed out yesterday. Bharat Forge kind of closed lower yesterday, a 4 percent gap would mean closer to about Rs 1,170 thereabouts. So, still sideways, but once we cross Rs 1,190, I think it should get more traction. So, compared to the two, I think I would still go with Edelweiss Financial.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Amongst all of the oil and gas companies, Chennai Petroleum Corporation and Reliance Industries look the best of the lot. Reliance clearly seems to have completed its correction and that is one of the reasons the market is not falling. So, on all declines towards Rs 1,500-1,550, Reliance is a buy. Chennai Petro is likely to go through some sort of correction, but closer to Rs 425-430, even there buying can be done,&amp;quot; &nbsp;he said.  &amp;quot;ICICI Bank has been hanging out in a very narrow range for many days and it needed some sort of news to push it higher. So, I think around these levels, if you can buy with Rs 290 type of stop loss, probably we could see Rs 305-306 over the next few days,&amp;quot; he added.  &amp;quot;Yes Bank is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 1,795 and target of Rs 1,840.&nbsp;Repco Home which declined quite a lot, seems like it is trying to make a bottom. That is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 670 and target of Rs 695.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;BEML is ready to go, so, this is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 1,875 and target of Rs 1,940.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Not only L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance Holdings, stocks&nbsp;like Dewan Housing, etc. -&nbsp;that is the benefit of getting into stocks which are in strong momentum regardless of what valuation maybe saying.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Dish TV is a nothing, 0.75 percent higher. I don&rsquo;t think the stock&nbsp;stands anywhere. You should buy on declines on all kinds of NBFCs, that remains the call. Repco Home is particularly looking good after a long decline post some poor results, etc. Bharat Electronics (BEL) is another one which is beginning to move up, as well as&nbsp;Eicher Motors. So several stocks are trying to move higher, so, this kind of early morning choppiness should be used to get long on the market.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;I don&rsquo;t know about how good Ducati will be for Eicher Motors but definitely the way the stock is moving, I think Rs 50,000 should be a target that people should have. Maybe it will take one to one and a half years, but definitely stocks which are making new highs, good news seems to be supporting them and they are continuously seeing buying at all lower levels.&amp;quot;  Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd"

But what gives me the biggest personal satisfaction is to have broken the myth that India is not ready to adopt advanced technology,&amp;quot; Ambani said in his letter to Jio employees.  Reliance Jio launched its mobile services commercially on September 5 last year, with 90 days of unlimited 4G data free along with free unlimited voice calling and access to services during roaming at no additional cost for lifetime.  India telecom sector touched its peak subscriber addition in the subsequent month when Jio commenced operation.  India's telecom subscriber base crossed the 1.1 billion mark in October, registering highest customer addition of around 29 million in a month. Out of this, the new entrant alone added 19.63 million subscribers.  Appreciating effort of the employees, Ambani said, &amp;quot;the way you laid out the infrastructure and technology and most importantly, the way you worked tirelessly to have more than hundred and thirty million satisfied customers, making Jio a truly customer obsessed organisation&amp;quot;.  As per Trai data, Jio had 123.36 million subscribers at the end of June.  A senior Jio official said during one of Jio's service, mobile data consumption in India went up from 20 crore GB per month to over 150 crore GB per month with Jio customers alone are consuming 125 crore GB.  &amp;quot;India moved up from 155 to number 1 in the world in terms of mobile data consumption. Jio has become the world's first and only exabyte telecom network with more than 100 crore GB data per month being accessed on its network. Jio is already carrying five times more data than all other telecom players put together in India,&amp;quot; the official said.  Ambani in the letter said that the way country has embraced 4G technology and the way it is being used has become case study for quantum technology leaps.  With the launch of Jio services, the cost of 1 GB mobile data has come down to less than Rs 10 from around Rs 250 priced earlier by other telecom operators.  &amp;quot;Together we have created the largest end-to-end all -IP 4G network in the world...India has adopted Jio as its own. This is also reflected in the gigantic spurt in data consumption and customer numbers on our network,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  RIL group firm Reliance Retail has recently unveiled first mobile phone, JioPhone, which it will provide effectively for free against refundable deposit of Rs 1,500 a unit. As per channel partners of Reliance Retail over 6 million JioPhone units have been booked in period of just 3 days.

Since then, voice has had a silent revolution (it&rsquo;s gone almost free) and data a noisy one (not free but bet it&rsquo;s never been cheaper). In no market in the world do the incumbents change the rule of the game but nor does a challenger set the rules in a manner Reliance did. Ever heard a 30-year-old established company accusing a Johnny-cum-lately of unfair trade?  In this passage of 365 days, the history of the country&rsquo;s mobile services industry has undergone some rewriting. The enormity of the numbers takes time to get one&rsquo;s head around. Even putting comparisons aside &ndash; most of them lose relevance -- their absolute size and scale are noteworthy.  A customer can talk endlessly today and use 1GB of data every day for a monthly spend of less than Rs 135. Successive reports by the telecom regulator have put Jio&rsquo;s data speeds ahead of its rivals&rsquo;.  One points out that data used to cost Rs 250 per GB before the Reliance Jio launch and comes for less than Rs 50 today. But the story doesn&rsquo;t end there. Data prices have not only crashed but the entire economics of data pricing has been disturbed for good. Call up a service centre of any incumbent and one can virtually bargain for any amount of data at rock-bottom tariffs. Tariff plans be damned: Now it&rsquo;s as if they can be totally customised.  At the customer end, two key steps went right for Jio. To begin with, customers appreciated the smooth experience they had at the time of taking a Jio connection &ndash; no documents, no photos but an Aadhaar ID was all that was needed. Post-connection verification was thus rendered irrelevant. Online recharging and various apps made it all the more pleasant. A foundation for a string of records that would be set in the coming months was thus laid.  The Reliance Industries subsidiary notched up 100 million subscribers within 170 days of its launch &ndash; translating into nearly 7 customers joining the company&rsquo;s platform every single second -- a feat achieved nowhere in the world. As on date, the company has over 130 million subscribers.  While Reliance Jio remains the most competitive in terms of quality of network and pricing, its entry has helped its rivals to buck up. Data speeds on every platform have improved and most are now talking of moving to a 4G network in a year or so. As a result, all industry metrics have undergone a change, the consumer being the ultimate beneficiary. Average post-paid monthly mobile bills are down by Rs 80-100. Industry average revenue per user fell Rs 10 quarter-on-quarter to Rs 131 in January-March.  Records in an industry, like in sports, are meant to be broken but some are difficult to break and some are just impossible. Take this one. Before the Jio launch, India was number 155 in terms of mobile data consumption by its citizens. A year later, India consumes more data than any other country in the world. In August 2016, data consumed in India was 20 crore GB per month. That number stands revised to 150 crore GB, a seven-and-a-half-fold jump. Talk of Indians&rsquo; appetite for data.  The company last month also launched JioPhone, a 4G feature phone, but had to stop taking further bookings within 5 days of their August 24 opening. In an industry first, the company will after three years refund the entire Rs 1,500 it is taking for the sale of phones. Voice calling on the JioPhone will always be free, according to the company. The delivery of phones for the initial set of bookings is expected to start this month.  The impact of Reliance Jio has gone beyond the consumer, pricing and consumption side of the industry. It has forced its rivals -- still much bigger &ndash; to rethink and revise their plans. It led to the UK-based giant Vodafone watering down its commitment to India. It is currently in the throes of merging its Indian unit with Idea Cellular where the multinational company will initially hold 45 percent stake against Idea&rsquo;s 35 percent with both the partners eventually holding equal stake in the combined entity.  A planned merger between Reliance Communications and Aircel is also underway. There is speculation of Bharti Airtel acquiring Tata Teleservices though doubts linger on that deal fructifying.  Number 2 and 3 combine to become number 1 and the old number 1 also goes shopping because the number 4 is just too much. An infant did teach the daddies a thing or two. Happy Teacher&rsquo;s Day.

The phone has ushered in a new product category of 4G feature phones including functionalities typically offered by smartphones, in the form of a feature phone.  How to book the JioPhone  The Jio phone can be booked online from the Jio website. Pre-bookings for the phone have already begun from August 4 for businesses.  The booking can also be done through the MyJio application and requires a Jio connection or a Jio ID.    If the app is not already installed, users will have to download the MyJio app on their smartphones. Once the pre-booking goes live, users will see a prominent &lsquo;Pre Book now&rsquo; button splashed across the home screen of the app itself.  Moreover, one can also track the status of the phones they have booked through the &ldquo;My bookings&rdquo; button. Users then have to enter the mobile number and their delivery PIN code. Once this is done, they can tap on the &ldquo;Proceed&rdquo; button.  Alternatively, One can pre-book the JioPhone through offline channels. The offline mode comprises of Jio retailers and multi-brand device retailers including the Reliance Digital stores network. The phone can also be bought through the official Jio website.  Payment options  The Rs 500 required for pre-booking the Jio phone can be paid through e-wallets JioMoney and Paytm.  The transaction can also be executed through UPI, credit card, debit card and net banking.  Once payment has been successfully done, a confirmation screen will pop up and an SMS will also be sent to the registered mobile number indicating that the device has been booked.  The unlimited data and voice calls&nbsp;plan on the phone will come at a price of Rs 153 per month.  To book a phone for someone else, and the same procedure needs to be followed.  In case you are booking a phone for someone else, remember to enter the phone number of the recipient person so that they will be able to get updates about their booked phone/s. In this case, both the person booking the phone will be receiving an SMS with confirmation of booking after the payment has been made.  Jio Phone features  Here are some of the other physical features of the phone:-  &mdash; Ability to be operated on voice command &mdash; An Alpha numeric keypad &mdash; 2.4 inch QVGA display &mdash; FM Radio and Torchlight &mdash; An SD Card slot &mdash; A four way navigation system &mdash; Apart from these the phone will come pre-loaded with Jio Apps such as JioMusic, JioCinema and JioTV.  To top it all, the company has also announced plans to incorporate NFC technology into the phone later this year. NFC or Near Field Communication allows exchange of files, pictures and videos between two phones. The technology can also be used to make payments, doing away with the need to have debit/credit cards in person. Simply, store card/account details on the phone and tap on NFC-enabled devices to make payments at grocery stores, retail shops and other outlets.  RIL has announced three plans for the JioPhone which includes a weekly plan of Rs 53, a two day plan of Rs 23 along with the Rs 153 plan which will offer unlimited data, unlimited talk time and unlimited SMS  Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd"

Jio&rsquo;s freebies have intensified the price war leading to a steady decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) -- an important metric for telecommunication players.,,"Business, Companies, Sector analysis",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/telecom-players-still-feel-jio-heat-reveals-trai-data-for-june-quarter_9541881.html,"Nitin Agrawal Moneycontrol Research  The entry of a formidable player like Reliance Jio has turned the Indian telecommunication industry upside down. Jio&rsquo;s freebies have intensified the price war leading to a steady decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) -- an important metric for telecommunication players.  The intensity of the competition is being felt by the debt-laden incumbents, evident from their latest results compared to last year's. Industry dynamics will change drastically.  What does the latest TRAI data suggest? Recently, TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) published financial data pertaining to gross revenues, adjusted gross revenues (AGR) and other parameters for the quarter ended June 2017. The data did not surprise us as it&nbsp;reflected the pain that incumbents have been highlighting.  For the understanding of our readers, AGR is calculated from gross revenues after adjusting for charges paid to other service providers, roaming revenues actually paid to other service providers, and service and sales tax paid to the government. Adjusted gross revenue ARPU is calculated by dividing AGR by the number of users and this is a measure of spending on telecom services per customer.  Competition shrinking the overall pie Telecommunication industry witnessed a significant decline of 13 percent (YoY) in gross revenues and 27 percent decline in AGR. The fall indicates that the customers are paying less for the services, primarily led by steep discounts offered by Jio and the response of the incumbents to these offers.  ARPUs decline continues Industry AGR ARPU also fell by 36 percent (YoY) and 7 percent (QoQ). It currently stands at Rs 80. A sequential fall in AGR ARPU indicates that the price war is far from over. In fact, we believe that the launch of the JioPhone might hurt incumbents further.  AGR for the top 3 players (Bharti Airtel, Idea and Vodafone) fell by 22 percent (YoY) in the quarter gone by and their ARPU fell by 28 percent (YoY) to Rs113.    Bharti &ndash; performance indicators not lending comfort Bharti Airtel&rsquo;s AGR fell 23 percent (YoY) to Rs 99 billion. However, it could gain 175 bps (YoY) in AGR market share on the back of 300bps market share gains in 900MHz circles. Airtel also witnessed a 30 percent (YoY) fall in its ARPU.    Idea and Vodafone &ndash; gaining market share at the cost of profitability Idea also witnessed a 21 percent (YoY) fall in its AGR. The fall was lower than Airtel on the back of higher conversion of AGR from gross revenue, perhaps with more calls landing in their own network. Idea&rsquo;s AGR market share witnessed an uptick of 165bps (YoY). However, ARPU for Idea continued the downward trend with 29 percent (YoY) fall and stood at Rs 105.  Vodafone also posted a similar set of numbers. It witnessed a steep fall of 21 percent (YoY) in its AGR and 26 percent in ARPU. However, Vodafone&rsquo;s gain of AGR market share was higher than Airtel and Idea. It rose by 180bps (YoY) and 60bps (QoQ) on the back of improved market share in the established circles.  Vodafone and Idea together have close to 46.8 percent AGR market share, much higher than the current leader, Airtel.    Jio- still in red Jio&rsquo;s AGR stood at a negative Rs 10 billion led by payment of Rs 21.5 billion access and other charges. Any decision to lower IUC (Interconnection Usage Charges) &ndash; the charges paid to the other networks to complete calls -- would be a big boost to its business. Jio&rsquo;s AGR market share is also negative and currently stands at a negative 3.7 percent.  Will Jio&rsquo;s monetisation efforts help the industry? The good news for the industry is that after intensifying the price war by providing freebies, Jio is now moving towards monetising its customer base, which stands at 123 million at the end of June-2017 (up from 108.9 million in March 2017). It is likely to adopt a balanced approach between revenue growth and subscriber additions.  The company has recently outlined new plans wherein it has reduced the validity indicating an uptick in ARPU (average revenue per user). The most prominent plan of Rs399 for 84 days validity translates into an ARPU of close to Rs 124, up from Rs 94 based on the earlier plan (Rs 309 for 84 days).  The price war has already eliminated the marginal players. With the stronger entities left in the fray, the industry can look forward to a relatively more rational competition, although not before a couple of more years of turbulence.

The total penalty now, which is in the form of disallowing recovery of cost incurred for missing the target during six years beginning April 1, 2010, stands at USD 3.02 billion, an oil ministry official said.  The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) allows RIL and its partners BP Plc of the UK and Canada's Niko Resources to deduct all capital and operating expenses from the sale of gas before sharing profit with the government.  Disallowing costs will result in government's profit share rising.  The government has claimed an additional USD 175 million as its profit share after the cost disallowance, the official said.  Gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas field in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block was supposed to be 80 million standard cubic meters per day but actual production was only 35.33 mmscmd in 2011-12, 20.88 mmscmd in 2012-13 and 9.77 mmscmd in 2013-14. The output has continued to drop in the subsequent years and is now below 4 mmscmd.  Emails sent to RIL and BP remained unanswered.  The two companies have challenged the cost disallowance of the past years and have initiated an international arbitration seeking dropping of the same on grounds that the PSC does not provide for any such punishment.  The government had for 2010-11 disallowed USD 457 million of cost, USD 548 million for 2011-12, USD 792 million for 2012-13, USD 579 million for 2013-14 and USD 380 million for 2014-15.  Now an additional USD 264 million has been disallowed for output lagging behind target in 2015-16.  The output was behind target in 2016-17 as well and the cost disallowance will be calculated only next year, the official said.  RIL had previously stated that &amp;quot;every year, based on its own interpretations of the PSC and assumptions (with which the contractor group does not agree), the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas revises the total cost it proposes to disallow and consequently aggregates the figure with figures of the previous years.  &amp;quot;It also demands additional profit petroleum (in total including previous year claims as well) as Government of India share&amp;quot;.  Of the additional profit petroleum claimed, the government has already collected gross USD 81.7 million in the gas pool account by taking away any gas price higher than USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit during November 2014 to March 2016 period.  From April 2016 to date, the gas price has been less than USD 4.2 and no deposits were made to the gas pool account.  Contractor group refers to RIL and its partners BP and Niko.

The four satellites and the other two finds (D29 and D30), R-Series and MJ gas discoveries, are the ones on which RIL and BP had in mid-June this year announced investing Rs 40,000 crore to reserve the flagging production from KG-D6 block.  They said development of the six satellite finds are being taken up together while D-34 or R-Series and D-55 (MJ) would have separate development plans.

The four fields have 617 billion cubic feet of reserves and can produce gas for eight years.  However, the companies did not begin the investment citing uncertainty over gas pricing.  Now that the government has allowed a higher gas price of USD 5.56 per million British thermal unit for yet-to-be- developed gas finds in difficult areas like the deepsea, RIL and BP have decided to take up their development.  This rate is comparable with USD 2.48 per mmBtu for currently producing fields.  The executives said these four finds are now been clubbed together with D29 and D30 discoveries, which had been held up over conformity tests.  They however did not give investment numbers saying a slump in global energy prices and services market will only see lesser amount of money being spent.  RIL-BP combine do not plan to alter the USD 3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, which was approved in August 2013.  About 12.9 mmscmd of gas for 13 years can be produced from from D-34 discovery, which is estimated to hold recoverable reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet.  A separate development plan for the MJ find would be submitted by mid-2018, they said.  RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG&mdash;D6 block. Of these, D&mdash;1 and D&mdash;3 &mdash;&mdash; the largest among the lot &mdash;&mdash; were brought into production from April, 2009, but output has fallen sharply from 54 mmscmd in March, 2010, to 3-4 mmscmd.  MJ is the only other field that was put to production. Together, the three fields today produce 6.4 mmscmd.

",,"Airtel, Business, Companies, reliance jio, TRAI, Vodafone",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/as-new-tech-enables-cheaper-voice-itâs-ridiculous-for-telcos-to-ask-for-higher-iuc_9332601.html,"Malini Bhupta Moneycontrol News  Battle lines are drawn yet again between large incumbent telecom operators and disruptive recent entrant Jio (owned by Reliance Industries). This time the dispute is over interconnect usage charge (IUC) or mobile interconnect charge (MTC), a charge that is paid by the service provider whose subscriber makes the call to the service provider in whose network the call is received. So if a caller of Idea calls a subscriber of Airtel, Idea pays Airtel 14 paise/min. Idea recovers this amount from its subscriber; the receiving party doesn&rsquo;t pay anything in India.  IUC is important not only from the perspective of operators as it gives them a revenue stream, but it is also a key component of voice tariffs and, therefore, also has a bearing on consumers&rsquo; monthly bills. This underscores the importance of the battle between the incumbent telecom operators and Jio.  In order to understand why smaller operators are asking for lower IUC while incumbents are asking for a higher charge, it is important to understand how the termination charge can be used as a lever by operators to change the competitive dynamics.  For instance, if mobile termination rates are too high then smaller operators &ndash; a group that currently includes Jio -- will never be able to attract new customers as costs would be high. A Trai consultation paper to review interconnect charge in 2014 highlighted this point and said: &ldquo;A large network may also seek to foreclose entry by charging high interconnection prices, which eliminates or weakens smaller competitors for the same pool of retail customers. In addition, a large network will, other things being equal, benefit from high interconnection charges which enhance its revenues.&rdquo; Smaller operators point out that globally IUC has been consistently coming down as a percentage of voice tariffs.  In fact, the share of IUC in overall voice tariff is between 1-13 percent in other global markets. In India, IUC accounts for 45 percent of voice tariff assuming voice tariffs are at 31 paise per minute. That said, it&rsquo;s worth noting that in absolute terms India&rsquo;s voice tariffs and interconnect charges are the lowest in the world and the share of IUC has been rising because tariffs have been driven down by competition.  Interconnect charges have never been an easy subject for India&rsquo;s regulators and all decisions to lower them have been challenged by the incumbents in courts. Interconnect usage charge was last reviewed and lowered to 14 paise/min from 20 paise/min in 2015, when Rahul Khullar was the Trai Chairman.  The regulator has now decided to review the termination charge again to evaluate if Bill and Keep (BAK, a regime where each operator bills its customers and keeps the money) can be implemented. Most regulators across the world have moved to a regime of low interconnect charges or BAK; BAK works best where there is symmetry in traffic or there are two operators, like in the United States.  The technological reason for IUC to fall is a change in how voice traffic is carried on mobile networks. As telcos migrate to the next generation IP (internet protocol) networks, the cost of carrying voice traffic is zero as carrying voice in the form of data packets requires little bandwidth.  The IP network carries voice on LTE (VoLTE) or voice over internet protocol (VoIP). In 2014 when the telecom regulator had discussed the migration from GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) to VoLTE, the assessment was that the time was not right and operators needed time. Now with Jio having launched its voice services on VoLTE and other operators looking to launch later this year, the argument to lower termination charges sounds logical.  Voice and SMS business for telecom operators across the world have been on the wane for years thanks to over-the-top (OTT) apps like WhatsApp and Skype. Between 2012 and 2018, global telcos&nbsp;are expected to lose USD 386 billion in revenues, says Fortune magazine. In several world markets voice is already free; this has been enabled by telcos moving to VoIP or VoLTE. The same would have played out in India, Jio or no Jio, if data and handset prices had been allowed to fall.  At Rs 250/GB of data and expensive handsets, data penetration did not pick up until Jio shook things up. There is plenty of demand for data in India: currently the country uses 120 crore GB a month, up eight times from last year&rsquo;s figure. A higher IUC on voice would skew Jio&rsquo;s economics and affect its financials.  Jio has launched its services on an IP network and voice services are offered through LTE or VoLTE. However, when the call terminates on GSM networks, subscribers of those other networks can receive the call even if they don't have VoLTE handsets. Incumbent telecom operators want interconnect charges be doubled from the current 14 paise/minute as the asymmetry in voice traffic has increased substantially after the launch of Reliance Jio&rsquo;s services and announced free voice services. With the increase in traffic, the incumbents are claiming that they need to make additional investments to support a &lsquo;tsunami of traffic&rsquo;.  However, this argument of incumbents telecom, experts say, is hard to comprehend because they are asking for higher charges to support legacy technology. An industry veteran asks: &amp;quot;Why should consumers pay for an inefficient, legacy technology?&amp;quot; If the interconnect charges are high then Jio would not be able to price its services attractively and take data to remote parts of the country even if its own cost of voice is significantly lower than those of the incumbents. Jio is seeking to change the industry&rsquo;s dynamics by offering voice free and push data usage. If Jio has to offer services at attractive rates, then it needs to also bring down costs and IUC is a big component of its cost structure. It is for this reason the Jio is arguing for either a very low mobile termination charge or BAK.    Industry experts believe that incumbents will find it very hard to justify higher interconnect charges only so that operators can support legacy 2G networks. Former regulators and telecom experts agree that incumbents demand higher IUC when networks are moving to IP and voice will be delivered on VoLTE is rather strange.  A very senior retired government official, who was closely associated with the sector, says Jio&rsquo;s argument for zero IUC is valid if networks are moving to VoLTE as the cost of carrying voice is negligible or zero on such IP networks. Airtel, Vodafone and Idea have talked themselves into a tough spot by announcing a shift to VoLTE and asking for higher charges to support an outdated technology.  At a simplistic level, voice delivered through IP is very different from 2G. According to some estimates, voice requires 18 kbps throughput which is equal to less than 0.13 MB per minute data equivalent. With data prices falling to Rs 10/GB this translates into 0.13 paise per minute. An IUC of 14 paise per minute would amount to substantially high per GB rate. The incumbents are also asking for a floor price for voice; this militates against the broader national aim of getting the best prices for consumers.  Industry stalwarts claim that incumbents want to restrict Jio by ratcheting up interconnect charges because Jio is well placed to offer voice and data services across India, as it has spectrum in the sub-1 Ghz band (850 Mhz), while incumbents don&rsquo;t have it in the sub-1 Ghz band yet. For VoLTE sub-1 Ghz spectrum is critical. This means that if Airtel, Vodafone or Idea have to launch VoLTE it would be on 1800 Mhz or 2300 Mhz, which are not very efficient for launch of voice over LTE. So while incumbents would be able to offer voice on GSM technology in rural areas, delivering data would take them longer. Jio, on the other, hand can offer voice and data in the remotest part of the country as it has built a network that is capable of delivering that.  Experts argue that while the regulator may find it hard to justify BAK, mobile termination charge can only go down from here as the shift in technology has driven down costs for voice, too. Globally, the move is towards unlimited voice and data: Telcos are moving to speed-based pricing instead of per GB and per minute rates.

The deferred payment period for spectrum is likely to be extended to 16 years (earlier 10 years), reveal sources to Financial Express. There could also be some relief on the interest front as telcos will likely to levied an MCLR of 8 percent as against the current prime lending rate of 12 percent, reports the newspapers.  These relief measures, if they come about, are expected to ease cash flow pressures for the telecommunications sector. The current norm is that if telecos have paid between 25 and 50 percent of the bid amount (as per their spectrum band), they will get a two-year moratorium.&nbsp;After the two-year period, the operators will have to pay the balance in 10 instalments within a decade.  At the IMG, Bharti Airtel urged for extending the moratorium to five years and increasing the number of instalments to 15.&nbsp;Idea Cellular asked for the number of instalments to be increased to 20.  The other demands which were pitched in by the operators are said to have been rejected. All the&nbsp;telcos&nbsp;asked for a reduction in licence fee, spectrum usage charge (SUC) and reducing the 18 percent GST rate.  The telecos opted for the licence fee to be cut to around 1 percent of their adjusted gross revenue against the current 8 percent. On SUC, they wanted it to fall by 2 percent, making it 1 percent.  Mobile termination rates will be as per TRAI's (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) decision. TRAI is currently reviewing the 14 paise per minute charges. Bharti Airtel and others want this to be hiked to 30-35 paise per minute whereas Jio (owned by Reliance Industries) is opting for a bill and keep (Net Payment Zero).  The telecoms have a Rs 4.60 lakh crore debt.

When asked if the company would work with some of the oil and gas companies to source BSVI grade fuel, Folger said: &amp;quot;Of course, we work with some of them.&amp;quot; Citing the example of Reliance Industries, he added that the oil and gas major has been exporting BS VI oil for the last five years.  &amp;quot;They are exporting to Europe, US. They actually produce more BS VI grade fuel for export markets than they do normal fuels for India,&amp;quot; Folger said. He added that the major challenge in front of them is the availability of BS VI fuel across adequate fuel stations across the country.  &amp;quot;If say 50 of our vehicles come into the marketplace how many fuel stations you expect to get BS VI fuel and how much time will it take to ramp it up. It is a hen and egg situation. We are waiting for all the fuel to be available and the fuel stations are waiting for all the vehicles to be there,&amp;quot; Folger said.  He added that it was important to start as early as possible with smaller volumes and then ramp it up accordingly. Elaborating further he said the company is in talks with various ministries regarding the issue.  &amp;quot;We have already asked Ministry of Road Transport and Highways whether they would support us and they haven't said no. They have asked us to speak to oil and gas companies and that's what we are doing,&amp;quot; Folger said.  In a bid to curb vehicular pollution, the government has decided to implement stricter emission norms of BS VI from April 1, 2020 by skipping BS-V altogether.

The Mukesh Ambani-promoted company, at the AGM, unveiled a feature phone that will be available for its users for effectively free of cost. A refundable security deposit of Rs 1,500 will have to be paid while availing the handset, which will be returned after 36 months.  The company&rsquo;s earnings surpassed analysts' expectations on Thursday as consolidated profit grew by 12.7 percent sequentially (up 28.3 percent YoY) to Rs 9,079 crore in Q1 FY18, driven by one-time gain and robust growth in petchem &amp;amp;amp; refining businesses.  Revenue from operations during the quarter declined 2.5 percent to Rs 90,537 crore QoQ but increased 26.7 percent year-on-year.  &amp;quot;Industry leading portfolio of assets in the refining and petrochemicals business contributed to considerable improvement in earnings for the quarter,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  Gross refining margin for the quarter grew by 3.5 percent to 9-year high of USD 11.9 a barrel against USD 11.50 a barrel on a sequential basis.  Singapore GRM was flat at USD 6.40 a barrel QoQ as lower cracks for light and middle distillates were offset by stronger fuel oil cracks and lower freight, it said.  Major global brokerages have retained their positive stance on the stock, while highlighting a pickup in monetisation plans, along with EPS upgrades due to the introduction of the phone.  Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,750  Citi observed that the upfront deposit for JioPhone is higher than the average feature phone price.

Investors, who are already invested in RIL, should continue with their long positions as there is limited downside while for those who are planning to add fresh positions can wait for a decline up to Rs 1,420-1,460, they say.  The June quarter results were better than analysts&rsquo; estimates which were led by strong refining and petrochemicals margins. Gross refining margin for the quarter grew by 3.5 percent to a 9-year high of USD 11.9 a barrel against USD 11.50 a barrel on a sequential basis.  The Q1 results pushed RIL to fresh 9-year high. The company has performed on all growth and profitability parameters across petrochemical, telecom, and retail divisions.  But, the trend might be slowly switching towards telecom and retail which will lead the next leg of growth for Reliance Industries as indicated by Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, RIL in 40th AGM.  The key highlight of RIL&rsquo;s 40th AGM was the aggressive expansion of Jio through a) launch of Volte phone free of cost, and b) market leading rates for data/television services on JIO and, c) the fast-growing technological additions to JIO.  &ldquo;The company is changing gear on telecom and retail business with growth across top line and bottom line and we believe that the next set of positive surprises on profit numbers will be visible from these two divisions over next 12 months,&rdquo; Nikhil Khandelwal, MD, Systematix Shares told Moneycontrol.  &amp;quot;Investors should continue to maintain longs or enter into new long positions in Reliance. We have a target of Rs 1,800 on the stock from 12 months perspective,&amp;quot;&nbsp;he said.  Meanwhile, Abhijeet Bora, Research Analyst, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas, Sharekhan advises investors to stay invested in Reliance Industries for the long term to benefit from earnings growth from commissioning of downstream projects and likely value creation from telecom venture.  &ldquo;We have a price target of Rs 1,665 on Reliance Industries,&amp;quot;&nbsp;he said.  Bonus issue good for investor sentiment  Reliance Industries in its 40th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Mumbai, announced a bonus issue of 1:1. This means that shareholders will get 1 bonus share for every one share held by an investor.  Well, this is the largest bonus issue in the country. Historically speaking, the company had previously announced a bonus issue prior to this in the years of 2009, 1997 and 1983.  &amp;quot;The predatory strategy to capture telecom space is quite aggressive and highly disruptive. The bargaining power that the company will enjoy once the competition is marginalized would be immense which is good for the investors in their long-term wealth creation journey,&amp;quot; Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities told Moneycontrol.  &amp;quot;It is a great opportunity for Reliance investors to enjoy the telecom wave plus the added 1:1 bonus advantage in the short term. One man&rsquo;s gain is other&rsquo;s loss is the reality in the telecom space,&amp;quot; he said.  Technical Outlook  The counter has rallied more than 5 percent in the last two weeks and the patterns on the weekly charts are looking indecisive. Added to this, last few days of price behaviour suggests that RIL could see some consolidation or mild correction.  &ldquo;As this energy giant has completely underperformed for a considerable period of time and a late entrant in this bull market with a massive breakout above its 8-year-old triangular formation, long term trends are very attractively placed,&rdquo; Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist &ndash; Technical Research &amp;amp;amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.  &ldquo;Hence, any decent correction should be considered only as a buying opportunity. If this counter is available in the zone of Rs 1,460&ndash;Rs 1,427 one should pick it up for a one year target of Rs1,649,&rdquo; he said.

The bigger talking points were the launch of JioPhone (with features of a 4G phone) and the aggressive tariff plans. Rival telecom operators who were bracing for more hurt can perhaps take solace in the fact they will not be the only ones suffering. Reliance&rsquo;s ambitious plans threaten the earnings of DTH and broadband players as well as cable operators. We do not fundamentally see this as a drain on earnings of Reliance Industries although we await some more clarity to deliver a final verdict on the same.  The Plans in a Snapshot  Customers looking to buy JioPhone will have to pay Rs 1,500 up front, which will be refundable after three years, thereby making the effective price of the handset zero.  Jio will work on increasing its coverage and has set a target of covering 99 percent of the population, much higher than the conventional 2G coverage.  The company also plans to open up 10,000 sales partners and increase touch points in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.  Voice will be free for life-time on JioPhone; however, customers will have to pay Rs 153 per month to access data (0.5 GB per day) services and various other entertainment content.  JioPhone TV cable will let customers connect Jio Phone to any TV. Customers can opt for existing Jio Dhan Dhan Dhan of Rs 309 pack that would allow users to watch almost 3-4 hours of videos daily, of their choice, on a large screen.  Additionally, Jio also launched 2 days and 7 days sachets at Rs 23 and Rs 53, respectively, to attract customers who cannot pay Rs 153 in a go.  What it means for the incumbent telcos?  With the above mentioned plans, Jio is now entering a market of 2G customers who were not exposed to the world of data due to the limitation of not owning an expensive hand-held device. Mukesh Ambani believes that there are close to 50 crore Indians who do not have access to 4G smart phone mainly because of its affordability and wanted to launch a 4G feature phone to cater to that section of the society.  By offering the phone technically free, the company is ensuring itself of an ARPU (average revenue per user) of Rs 153, and this sets the ceiling for ARPU of incumbent operators who are looking beyond the urban market for growth.  Interestingly, the voice ARPU of this segment of users is reportedly in double digits. If Jio is able to migrate a sizeable population to its Jio Phone, the ARPU improvement for the company will be significant. While we do not expect the entire population to migrate, 10-15 percent migration in the next couple of years wouldn&rsquo;t be a tall target.  While the impact on the incumbent telcos is known, the bigger surprise was the attack on the cable operators, DTH players and broadband operators with JioPhone TV cable. The Dhan Dhana Dan offer at Rs 309 works out to an ARPU of Rs 165, which is close to what most of the DTH operators were making in a stable macro environment.    &amp;amp;nbsp;  However, pricing cannot be the only reason to shift from existing service providers. We feel that the acquisition of close to 25 percent stake in Balaji Telefilms will have far reaching implications for the business. Jio is likely to use Balaji and churn out exclusive content for its subscribers (akin to what players like Netflix does in the west) to wean away customers from competition.  Read more:&nbsp;Free voice not enough, Ambani wants free phone to Jio democratic digital culture  What it means for Jio?  What is comforting for us is RIL&rsquo;s focus on monetizing even from the so-called &ldquo;bottom of the pyramid&rdquo; while making the offer look like a freebie. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that Reliance is likely to generate revenue of close to Rs 20,336 crore in FY18 and Rs 32, 370 crore in FY19 which is close to 4.5 percent of its FY18 revenue and 6.7 percent of its FY19 revenue.    In a move that makes sense both from a business and financial perspective, the Rs 1500 payment upfront for acquiring the phone would be positive from a working capital perspective. Finally, should the cost of acquisition of the phone get depreciated over three years, it would create a tax shield to minimize the financial cost of this plan.  So, while the earnings impact of today&rsquo;s agenda may not be significant for Reliance&rsquo;s bottomline in the coming two years (that will basically ride on an improved core earnings), it marks a change in more ways than one. Firstly, it weakens the competition, makes data usage a part of life for more Indians that can be successfully capitalized at a later stage when competition thins out to a great extent.

Because just as the company heralded the equity culture in India, it now aims to, in Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;democratise the digital culture in India&rdquo;. So a 1:1 bonus, the largest in India&rsquo;s corporate history, was lost in the din. What took over the mindspace at Birla Matushree was a free, intelligent and feature-rich JioPhone.  Subscribers will be able to enjoy unlimited data on the JioPhone at Rs 153 every month. They will also have the option of recharging with a Rs 53 voucher that will run for a week or with a Rs 23 coupon carrying a two-day validity.  The impact of today&rsquo;s announcement will be felt far and wide. While RIL subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm continues to rattle the incumbent mobile service providers, today&rsquo;s announcements shook up shares of cable TV distributors and direct-to-home TV service providers as well. Surely, the disruption unleashed by Reliance Jio last year is set to spread to other industries.    Telecom &amp;amp;amp; DTH Stocks Crack  RIL share rose 3% while those of incumbent mobile operators like Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular were down 3% and 5%, respectively. Direct-to-home service providers like Dish TV and Sun TV too fell 7% and 4%, respectively. Ambani reiterating his company&rsquo;s commitment to bringing world-class, super-fast optic fiber broadband connectivity to people&rsquo;s homes only made the matters worse for those stocks.  The Jio Phone will initially cost Rs 1,500 but this will be refundable after three years. The most unique feature about the phone is that the user will be able to connect the mobile to any kind of TV including the old, bulky TVs known as CRT (cathode ray tube) TVs and mirror all content. &nbsp;Like the 125 million Jio service users so far, all Jio Phone buyers will also get free voice calls.  JioPhone Availability  Available for beta testing from August 15, the bookings for the JioPhone will start from August 24. Buyers who have pre booked will get the phones from September on &lsquo;first come, first served&rsquo; basis. All JioPhones will be made in India from October.  The spirit of Ambani&rsquo;s almost one-hour-long speech went with the faith of the company&rsquo;s 2.5 million plus shareholders, the chants of &ldquo;Jio, Jio&rdquo; inside the auditorium complimenting the passionate speech.  Higher Stakes  While in Ambani&rsquo;s words, Reliance&rsquo;s Golden Decade has just begun, it is not the first time India&rsquo;s most valuable company has disrupted the market. People still remember the sturdy, blue screen and white body LG and Samsung phones that allowed them to &lsquo;Kar Lo Duniya Mutthi Mein&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Monsoon&rsquo; had a lot of &lsquo;Hungama&rsquo; then too and the CDMA voice those days was as clear as they came.  The stakes are only higher and wider this time. The pre-2000 India was a country coming out of licence raj and landlines still ruled. A 3-minute inter-state call &mdash; known as STD or trunk call &mdash; cost as much as Rs. 24 even in early 2000. Today&rsquo;s India is vastly different, as Jio has itself demonstrated &mdash; the company garnered 100 million customers within 170 days of its launch. It added 7 customers per second every single day &mdash; faster than Facebook, WhatsApp or Skype. It is the largest and the fastest technology adoption of any kind anywhere in the world.  RIL, with Jio, is not going to be content just connecting people through voice and data. It wants to get inside homes, influence &mdash; if not rule &mdash; daily lives. Offering a phone that&rsquo;s virtually free, can take voice commands and also carry content to any TV marks a paradigm shift that may wipe out existing industries and create new ones.  With an eye on replacing the 50 crore feature phone users in India, a target of making 5 million JioPhones available every week conveys a very small message of the big story.

The company also announced 1:1 bonus issue, which was approved by all shareholders through postal ballot.  Some of the other highlights were Voice to remain free on JioPhone, Reliance will collect a fully refundable, one-time, security deposit of Rs 1,500 with every JioPhone, JioPhone users to get unlimited data at Rs. 153 per month, JioPhone users to get the already popular Dhan Dhana Dhan plan at Rs. 153 per month etc.  Reacting to the various announcements and the impact it may have on the stock going forward and also the impact on other incumbents.  Deven Choksey, MD, KRChoksey Investment Managers said a new way of business seems to have been showcased. Reliance is trying to create an Apple-effect by launching JioPhone and, reaching out to masses which will definitely create more number of users. This all will lead to large amount of data consumption and reach happening simultaneously.  At the same time, there will be pressure on the incumbents, existing players and will have a big blow. The current players will have to put their act together and invest more money to be in line with business. With regards to Reliance Jio, there will be distinct growth in the subscriber base from around 12.5 crore to 30 -35 crore in around 18 months or so.  According to him, the different schemes and cheap phone is with an aim to attract more customers. Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of acquiring stake in a content company is a big positive in generating higher revenues going forward.  &ldquo;It is like a typical new generation company which is trying to acquire new customers at throwaway prices - by practically offering JioPhone at a zero price,&rdquo; said Choksey.  SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com has a clear sell on Idea Cellular, Bharti Airtel because there does not seem to be any growth coming in for them &ndash; in fact one could see de-growth in terms of subscribers, ARPUs and revenues. With regards to RIL there may not be much change but now with the bonus announcement and visibility seen in its telecom space, the stock price could go to Rs 2000 in next 12 months.  Referring to the JioPhone, Dhan Dhana Dhan package, Pradeep Baijal, Former TRAI Chairman says, the company has bought in innovative packages and they will be able to sustain it.  Tulsian says with the features that JioPhone is offering there is no reason for people not to migrate to Reliance Jio, adding that one could see at least 25 percent of migration happening. Most people are price conscious, so migration will happen.  However, one should keep in mind that more than anything else the most important thing for a subscriber is the service, says Tulsian. According to him, this bundling offer by RIL will see explosion of addition of people to the telecom space.  Meanwhile, Nitin Soni, Director-Asia Pacific TMT, Fitch Ratings says the phone handset and plan offer looks very disruptive given that it is virtually free but could be an experiment. However, with Reliance targeting the tier 2, tier 3 cities, the 4G handset adoptability will increase in those cities but historically, such kind of subsidised handset and bundling has never worked because the subscribers look to buy their own handset and buy the SIMs of the shelf.  Soni is also not sure that these offers will impact the revenues of other incumbents because 20 percent of their customers reside in metropolitan cities, which make 80 percent of profits.  Meanwhile, he says Reliance Jio's 4G feature handset is targeted at tier 2, tier 3 cities because the subscriber addition for Jio could have been limited if subscribers could not afford a 4G smartphone. &ldquo;So to increase the adaption of 4G smartphone, they had to come out with cheaper handset and had to make it compelling so that a lower middleclass person would buy this kind of handset,&rdquo; says Soni, adding that it is good for Jio but it may not have a major dent on incumbents financials.  Naveen Kulkarni, Co-Head of Research, PhillipCapital thinks Reliance is also cautious in their approach with the offer andplans because they are looking at pre-booking model and checking the market in terms of the size of market - the target market is typically slow moving and do not change handset as often as some other category of customers. So, this kind of strategy&nbsp; has its own challenges but may not be hugely negative for the industry. However, if it could help grow the industry then it is a big positive.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Reema: Can you first run us through your recommendation for today, Singer India.  A: This is a debt free multinational company and Singer of Netherlands, they are holding 72 percent stake in the company. If you see the main business of the company, is that of sewing machine marketed under the brand name of Singer Merritt. We all know that those who have been growing in this country that Singer is a name to reckon with. This is a 150 year old brand.  Apart from that, company from last one year has moved into household appliances also and because of the excellent pan India distribution network, they thought that probably moving into household appliances will be a logical expansion by the consumer durable company and this is seen panning out. Now it is indicated that the company is seen going very aggressive in the time to come to expand the household portfolio because till FY17, the financial performance has not been that great on the household appliances front. Only the sewing machines have been contributing to the entire turnover and profitability of the company.  Go on the financials, Rs 375 crore turnover, operating profit 10 percent, 35 percent increase on operating profit, 55 percent increase on topline, and PAT has risen to Rs 8 crore plus; again 35 percent increase, EPS of Rs 7.50. As I said, it is a debt free company, company has the plans of moving into the domestic appliances and kitchen appliances, I am expecting that the kind of valuations now given the consumer appliances company, you get to read the news at Ken Star just getting an offer of about Rs 1,200 crore for buying the brands and all that.  I am not saying that the company is owning Singer brand, because brand is owned by their parents Netherland, but the kind of ramp up which we are going to see and diversification into the consumer appliances with MNC status, probably maybe it is not in FY18-FY19 the company will move into double digit EPS and taking that into consideration, probably at a P/E multiple of 25-26 on a forward earnings, not on the current year&rsquo;s earnings, share looks very cheap.  In fact on the same basis, I have recommended Multibase if you recall about a month back which has almost moved up by about 40 percent in this last maybe 1-1.5 month. So, this is also another MNC looking very good with a target of Rs 360 expected in next six months or so.  Latha: I just wanted your thoughts on Reliance Industries?  A: Yesterday I have expressed my view that excellent numbers and if you see the core business showing this kind of tremendous increase of about 150 basis points or maybe 10 percent increase in petchem and 15 percent, that is phenomenal and that is bound to see getting reflected into the share price by P/E expansion because people have all been talking of Reliance Jio, but if you see their core business and if they keep reporting an EBIT margin of 10 percent plus, because refining segments never had an EBIT margin of more than 8-9 percent or in a range of 8-9.  Company has now moved into the range of maybe anywhere between 10 and 11.5. Similar is the case with petchem; never moved beyond 12-14 percent but now seem to be in the 14-16 percent range. These are things are likely to sustain because when the crude has fallen, when you did not have any kind of inventory loss or maybe when the GRMs have been soft and in that scenario if the company is able to post GRM of 11.6 percent, I think it is phenomenal.  So, taking all this into consideration, if I take a P/E of, maybe blended P/E of 16, if I apply different P/E multiple, maybe on refining about 10-11 P/E multiple, on petchem about 20-21 because if you see the P/E multiple given to Finolex Industry kind of things, maybe on Reliance Jio, on the net present or net asset value, finance and all that, maybe a P/E multiple of 12-14 you can easily give a blended P/E multiple of about 16-17 and that translates into a share price of 1,780-1,880 maybe in next 6-12 months.  In fact yesterday I have expressed my view that probably this time post numbers we will see Reliance Industries trading in the green with an uptick of maybe closer to 4 percent or so.  Reema: What are your thoughts on Jaiprakash Associates, I think you have been positive on Jaypee Infratech, but how would you approach some of the other stocks?  A: If you see why Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has bought, he has seen the potential of the assets and the future earnings potential after the debt restructuring. In fact, I have propagated this theory when many of the experts and channels were not agreeing with that view that equity has zero value, they are all junk, ultimately will get liquidated kind of things. So similar pattern and at that time I have been very categorical in saying that take your call on these stocks.  If you recall, at that time JP Associates was at Rs 13-14, Jaypee Infratech was at Rs 9, Bhushan Steel was at Rs 50, Monnet Ispat at Rs 30, Amtek Auto at Rs 25 and still I maintained the same view. This has happened in case of JP Associates but that kind of dramatic upturn you are going to see in cases of other stocks also which I have said. So, I am keeping a very hopeful and positive bias because if a stock specific case, I will say that JP Associates has gone leaner with a debt of about Rs 10,000 crore now with a real estate, hotel property, EPC business, cement capacity of 6-8 million tonne and these type of call needs to be taken for each company.  In fact about a month back on the channel I have said that these kind of stocks can give you a return of 100-200 percent. I still maintain my same view for these four to five stocks which I have said and I won&rsquo;t be finding much risk in JP Associates even at the current levels or maybe in Jaypee Infratech if an investor has a view of about one year. You are right in cautioning that Rakesh has a cost of about Rs 13-14 and probably JP Associates maybe in the F&amp;amp;amp;O ban also, so don&rsquo;t take trading call, be an investor. If you take a daily swing with the price volatility, these stocks are not meant for those kind of investors, but I see huge potential even in JP Associates from here on going forward."

Segmental results &ndash; strong on all counts  The key segment of Refining registered 18% year on year growth in topline and reported Gross Refining Margins (GRM) of $ 11.9/bbl as against $ 11.5/bbl in the previous and the corresponding quarter. Despite flat Singapore Complex Margin, Reliance&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by $ 5.5/bbl. The marginally weaker product cracks were offset by yield shift and robust feedstock management. Favourable Brent-Dubai differential also aided crude sourcing during the quarter.    Highest petchem margin  For the petrochemicals segment, revenue increase of 22.9% was aided by price increase and volume expansion due to capacity addition. The EBIT margin for the quarter was at 15.8%, at an all-time high level.  During the quarter the company has commissioned the PX facility which should support the earnings momentum going forward as well. With the commissioning of this plant, RIL&rsquo;s PX capacity has more than doubled making it world&rsquo;s second largest producer of PX with about 11% of global production.  Retail &ndash; strong show  Retail also reported a strong show with revenue registering a growth of 74%. Margins improved a tad and the business added 18 stores during the quarter thereby taking the total number of stores to 3,634.    Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas &ndash; the new beginning?  However, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas continued with a subdued show &ndash; revenues de-growing by 1.2% led by lower volumes in US shale and domestic operations. However, it is important to note that the financial performance of US Shale has improved driven by better price environment, slightly higher production and stable cost structure.  For the Indian upstream business, in June 2017, Reliance and BP have announced their intent to develop already discovered deep water gas fields.  Time to reap benefits of long gestation capex  RIL&rsquo;s USD 18.5&nbsp;billion core projects (petcoke gasification, polyester expansion, off-gas cracker and ethane sourcing) are now either complete or on the verge of completion. The massive capex had supressed return ratios so far. Since many of the long gestation projects for RIL are nearing commissioning, this should significantly improve return ratios and cash flows going forward.  In FY17, RIL completed the world&rsquo;s largest and most complex ethane sourcing project. The PX facility has been commissioned in the quarter. The Refinery Off gas Cracker (ROGC) project is expected to be fully commissioned by 3QFY18, and the petcoke gasifier project by 4QFY18.  The AGM will perhaps throw more light on the timeline of these project commissioning. Market also awaits clarity on Jio&rsquo;s capex in light of the surprise fund raising that got announced.  What next for Jio?  Reliance surprised the street by announcing Rs20,000 crore rights issue of optionally convertible preference shares for Jio to further fund its 4G foray. The money raised through rights issue would be utilized to further strengthen Jio&rsquo;s network reach and quality.  After intensifying the price war in the industry by providing freebies, Jio is now moving towards monetizing its customer base, which stands at 117.4 million at the end of May-2017 (up from 108.9 million in Mar 2017) and following a balanced approach between revenue growth and subscribers addition.  The company has recently come up with new plans wherein it has reduced the validity indicating an uptick in ARPU (average revenue per user). The most prominent plan of Rs399 for 84 days validity translates into an ARPU of close to Rs124, up from Rs94 based on the earlier plan (Rs309 for 84 days). This, however, is much lower than the incumbents&rsquo; ARPU (Airtel: Rs 158, Vodafone: Rs 142, Idea: Rs 142).  Based on ARPU and subscribers base, our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that Jio is expected to generate Rs12,450 crores of revenues in FY2018. Moreover, we believe that the potential consolidation in the industry will support the case for higher ARPU for the key players in the industry.  Additionally, Jio&rsquo;s plan to launch Rs500 4G mobile phone would give it an edge in capturing additional subscribers coming from the mass market and can help it penetrate in rural areas.  The new addition &ndash; Balaji Tele  What took he street by surprise was Reliance&rsquo;s investment of Rs413 crore (24.9 percent stake) in Balaji Telefilms. This investment will act as a medium to source content for its Jio platform. Experts believe this to be a very rational and relevant move.  In sum, with capex in core projects now translating to cash flows and telecom staring at break-even, despite the run up in the stock, the valuation at 12.5X projected earnings of FY18 deserves attention.

Our industry leading portfolio of assets in the refining and petrochemicals business contributed to the considerable improvement in our earnings for the quarter,&rdquo; Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman, and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said in the press release.  Total Revenues:  Consolidated Total revenues rose 27.7 percent on a YoY basis to Rs90,537 crore for the quarter ended June 30, compared to Rs71,451 crore reported in the year-ago period.  The increase in revenue is primarily on account of increase in prices and volumes of refining and petrochemical products partially offset by lower prices and volumes from E&amp;amp;amp;P business.  Revenue was also boosted by robust growth in retail business which recorded a 73.6% increase in revenue to a Rs11,571 crore. Brent crude oil price averaged $ 49.9/bbl in 1Q FY18 as compared to $ 45.6/bbl in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Strong beat on GRMs:  Strong refining and petrochemicals margin environment contributed to higher operating profits for the quarter. Gross refining margins recorded nine-year-high of $ 11.9/bbl whereas petrochemicals EBIT margin were at an all-time high of 15.8 percent.  Increase in Employee Cost:  Employee cost increased by 16.3 percent at Rs2,455 crore ($ 380 million) as against Rs2,111 crore in corresponding period of the previous year due to increased employee base and higher payouts.  Operating profit rose by nearly 12%  Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 11.9 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs12,554 crore ($ 1.9 billion) from Rs11,223 crore in the previous year.  Operating profit was led by robust performance from petrochemicals business and sustained strength in the refining business. This was partially offset by losses in Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas business due to lower volumes and weak domestic price environment.  Capital Expenditure:  The capital expenditure for the quarter ended 30th June 2017 was Rs25,192 crore (USD 3.9 billion) including exchange rate difference capitalization.  Capital expenditure was principally on account of ongoing projects in the petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar and Digital services business.  Refining Margins:  During 1Q FY18, revenue from the Refining and Marketing segment increased by 18.3 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs66,945 crore (USD 10.4 billion). Gross Refining Margins (GRM) for 1Q FY18 stood at USD 11.9/bbl as against USD 11.5/bbl in 1Q FY17.  RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.5/bbl. Marginally weaker product cracks environment on Q-o-Q basis was offset by yield shift and robust risk management. Further, favorable Brent-Dubai differential aided crude sourcing during the quarter.  Petchem Margins:   1Q FY18 revenue from the Petrochemicals segment increased by 22.9 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs25,461 crore (USD 3.9 billion), primarily due to increase in prices of PP, PVC, PTA, and Polyester and increase in volumes due to addition in the capacity of PX at Jamnagar.  Petrochemicals segment EBIT increased sharply by 43.7 percent to Rs4,031 crore (USD 624 million), supported by favorable product deltas and volume growth. EBIT margin for the quarter was at 15.8 percent, an all-time high level.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas Business:  1Q FY18 revenues for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment decreased by 1.2 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 1,324 crore primarily due to lower volumes in US shale and domestic operations. Segment EBIT was at (373) crore, impacted by an overall decline in volumes and lower realizations in domestic business.  Retail business revenue grew by 73%  1Q FY18 revenues grew by 73.6 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to a Rs11,571 crore, a milestone level for quarterly revenues. The increase in revenue was led by growth across all consumption baskets.  The business delivered strong PBDIT of Rs398 crore in 1Q FY18 as against Rs240 crore in the corresponding period of previous year, reflecting a robust growth of 65.8 percent.

The company is planning to launch it in the second half of August. However, it could not be ascertained if the handsets will be sold by Reliance Retail or Jio.  &amp;quot;Reliance has not yet finalised actual unit price of the feature phones, but it is likely to be in the range of Rs 1,000-1,500 a unit. It will be smart feature phone with pre- loaded apps of Reliance Jio like Jio TV, Jio Money etc,&amp;quot; one of the sources who did not wish to be named said.  He said the phone will not have touchscreen facility like smartphones, but will have rest of facilities like wi-fi connectivity and browsing and come with a cable that can connect the handset with television sets to watch Jio TV content.  &amp;quot;The company is eyeing 2G users who cannot afford expensive smartphones and are paying high call rates. Jio's voice calls will be free which will encourage them to buy these handsets,&amp;quot; the source said.  Reliance Jio has started the process of importing handsets and is in discussion with Foxconn and Intex to make them in India.  &amp;quot;Around 10 million units are being planned for initial sales and the company has plans to increase inventory to 100 million in the first year and another 100 million next year. Discussions have started with Foxconn and Intex to make these phones in India,&amp;quot; the source said.  Mobile industry body Indian Cellular Association in a submission to the government has said the total size of Indian mobile phone market was estimated to be around 280 million units in 2016 and is expected to grow to 320 million by 2018.  A source privy to discussions said Intex had approached RIL for bundling Jio service for a state government tender.  &amp;quot;Intex will bid for a state government tender which has huge requirement of low-cost mobile phone, but it wants bidder to come with a service provider. The economy of scale is enough to bring down the cost of phone. The discussion with RIL started for this tender and is now moving in direction for low-cost 4G feature phones,&amp;quot; the source said.  He said Jio will use Qualcomm chipsets in 4G feature phones.  When contacted, Reliance Jio declined to comment. Intex said: &amp;quot;...we are exploring various business opportunities, including those with Reliance Jio, and would keep you updated about the details as they materialise.

It retained its add call on limited upside. Among key risks, it believes that increase in slippages and slowdown in retail loan demand would be the risks.  Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,870  CLSA termed IndusInd Bank&rsquo;s Q1 profit to be a tad ahead of estimates with better net interest income and lower operating expenditure. Having said that, 21 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ) rise in NPLs was a tad disappointing, CLSA mentioned in its report.  Going forward, it sees a 25 percent CAGR over FY17-20, while it will watch out for underwriting in unsecured retail loans as well as market risk from higher bond holdings. It also raised the earnings estimates by 1-2 percent.  Brokerage: Kotak Equities | Rating: Add | Target: Rs 1,620  The brokerage house highlighted that the first quarter was not as stable as previous quarters, but was still going well. Further, it said that valuations are unlikely to change as underlying growth momentum is strong. Further, it expects the bank to deliver 20 percent earnings CAGR over FY17-20 on the back of 25 percent loan growth.  Brokerage: Goldman Sachs | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,499  The global research firm called the bank&rsquo;s Q1 to be in line with expectations, but said that the operating trends were not trending. It reduced the FY18-19 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by up to 3 percent on Q1 trends. The neutral stock is given the balanced risk-reward at current valuations.  Brokerage: Nomura | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,850  Nomura highlighted that improving net interest margins along with lower capital consumption was a key positive. IndusInd Bank delivering profitability with lower capital consumption was also a positive. Meanwhile, it said that the asset quality miss was due to a migration of 50 percent of restructured book into NPAs.  Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,700  The global financial services firm saw strong trends in CASA, while cost ratios improved. Even though the bank reported rise in non-performing loans (NPLs), the overall stress has declined. Further, it said that the balance sheet now is more exposed to interest rate movements than other banks. Meanwhile, slippages increased largely due to restructured loans, it said, adding that it is expecting strong and steady trends for Fy18/19.

Productivity gains and above-industry growth rates should follow, it added. Further, it sees 26 percent earnings CAGR over FY19-20. Slow growth and rise in delinquencies are key risks, it added.  Brokerage: Bank of America Merrill Lynch | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,800  The global research firm said that growth and margins sustained and the overall asset quality was comfortable with headline gross NPLs at 109 basis points. The highlight of the quarter was a stronger corporate loan growth at 26 percent year on year  Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,750  Morgan Stanley observed that higher provisions and muted vehicle loan growth were softer aspects in the first quarter. Further, it added that it doesn&rsquo;t expect them to be mute going forward. Among key positives are stable margin, strong savings deposit/fee growth as well as higher capital, it added.  Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 1,500  Jefferies said that utilization of past provisions to improve provision coverage is a positive development. It expects the stock to deliver returns in line with the earnings growth and tweaks estimates by +1.5 percent in FY18 by -2 percent in FY19/20. Sustained loan growth and higher than expected fall in funding cost are the key upside risk, while slower loan growth and asset quality are key downside risks.  Reliance  Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy  CLSA highlighted that Jio&rsquo;s reduction in promotion benefits aims at maximizing subscriber retention. Further, stable &amp;amp;amp; high-speed data performance should make Jio a favoured network.  It now awaits clarity if the company will start expensing Jio from the second quarter of this fiscal. It also believes that investors will overlook initial losses during promotional periods and will focus on subscriber retention and slow monetisation.

Furthermore, private banks and State Bank of India&rsquo;s (SBI) profit could be stable, but other PSUs may report a sharp fall. It also expects smaller private banks to lead with over 25 percent year on year profit growth.  Going forward, asset quality and provisions may drive volatility in profit against the backdrop of large upgrades. A 10 percent change in provisions can impact its profit estimates by 19 percent.  Telecom  Brokerage: CLSA  The channel checks point to an aggressive 4G feature phone launch by Reliance Jio. The telecom major&rsquo;s target market for a new offer would be 150 million feature phone users. Its channel checks also suggest that Jio&rsquo;s offers could end, implying a relief for incumbents."

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Anuj: New 52 week high, in fact new nine year high on Reliance Industries. What are your thoughts on what would have transpired today?  A: Difficult to attribute any reason because I can't say that there has been expansion or maybe the value accretion seen in its telecom business. However, one thing which comes to my mind is the expansion in the refining margin because the crude, the kind of corrections which we have seen in crude, one may argue that they will be having the inventory losses, but the kind of end product or maybe the product mix, whether you take gasoline or maybe the middle heavy distillates that is diesel and petrol both, and the kind of procurement which the company is making from the small oil producing countries because the more crude falls, more the bargaining power to the purchaser will come because the countries like maybe Venezuela, Nigeria, those who are really starved of the US dollar will be selling the crude at any price.  So, I am not expecting that to happen for Q1, but Q2 I won't be surprised to see the GRM getting expanded by USD 1-1.5 per barrel and that will be seen quite positive because Q1 numbers probably may not factor in anything from the telecom operations. Either company may not disclose that or even if the company reports that, it will not be seen significant. So, difficult to take a call on that.  Coming on petrochemicals, because prices of petchem have seen to be stable because of the crude derivative or the raw material being the crude derivative seen to have softened. So, even there they have to pass through and I am not taking a very positive call on the gas exploration, on the British Petroleum (BP) press conference. If you just want to attribute some reason, you can always say that BP conference has happened and they are very bullish, Rs 40,000 crore investment, but quite positive, extremely positive on the refining margin and won't be surprised to see it expanding by about at least USD 1.5 per barrel in Q2 while Q2 has just begun.  Anuj: What are your thoughts on CDSL, right now we all know that it is a fact that it was such a sought after issue that is playing out right now, but at Rs 340 what would be the call on CDSL and BSE as well?  A: I won't be taking a positive view on CDSL for the simple reason that if you see the kind of growth which they have achieved of 57 percent in last financial year in terms of their business growth, inspite of that they have a market share of 44 percent. If you see the kind of transaction charges or maybe the charges which they are charging from the company being listed on the CDSL and NSDL, obviously that is seen shrinking. Always if you see, Sebi has always kept a watch on both depositories and kept on directing them to reduce the charges. So, I don&rsquo;t know how much really one can expect their business to grow.  If I take a call on the expected EPS, I don't think that can be seen above Rs 10 or maybe that will hardly be touching double digit. So, can you give a P/E multiple of 35? I doubt because sometimes what happens that we see these kind of in fact I have said that on the listing day also that probably you may have an upside of Rs 300 but beyond that it will be difficult to take a call and now it is ruling at Rs 350. So, definitely it has gone in a risky zone because even NSDL which is the depository and having a 56 percent market share, will be seen quite aggressive and sooner or later maybe in the next couple of years, even they will go public.  Coming rub off effect on BSE, BSE is holding 24 percent stake in the company and by virtue of that, the share price of BSE is moving up. However, can that argument again remain valid because 24 percent is a minority stake and you can't attribute the valuation criteria merely on that because the divestment or the offer for sale in CDSL has happened at the instance of Sebi or maybe the regulations because BSE had to bring it down, their stake till 24 percent and that is what has happened.  So, I won't be just taking a positive view on BSE also because the kind of cap on the charges and all sort of things and in my view because take the case of MCX where we have been taking a positive view, at least one can argue that the options are getting introduced and if they introduce the options in one commodity because Sebi has allowed only one commodity to be chosen by one commodity exchange, at least you have a very big trigger of new option getting introduced in the commodity market which can see their turnover increasing by 60 percent. So, unless and until you have some incremental income growth to be seen in CDSL, or BSE, I won&rsquo;t be chasing the momentum at the current level.  Surabhi: Has something changed fundamentally in terms of pricing; you have been telling us about the UP situation, but a lot of diverse sugar stocks are running up today.  A: I have been saying this for last one week and in my recommendations in this last one week or CNBC Awaaz and CNBC-TV18, maybe three or four have been the recommendations of sugar. Now, again, let me reiterate and repeat the things what has happened, in the month of June there was destocking happening at the dealers level, distributor&rsquo;s level and retailers level and that has seen virtually sugar stocks getting exhausted. Now, if you see the situation, the kind of renewed orders are seeing that has already seen the prices having increased by Rs 0.60 to Rs 0.75 per kilogram in the UP.  In Bihar the prices have moved beyond Rs 37-37.50 per kilogram. That means there the prices have moved up by Rs 1 per kilogram. Now, whatever information which I have, that the cabinet is preparing a note of increasing the import duty from 40 percent to 50 percent, and that note should be out in maybe in the next one week or so, and apart from that, the global white sugar prices which fell to a low of USD 420 per tonne have started improving. So, if you take the situation going forward, the kind of inventory, the situation is very low on the inventory front. Except for UP sugar mills, no other mills are holding any inventory whether in Maharashtra, Karnataka, or Tamil Nadu.  So, even the sugar from UP is coming altogether to the Southern part of India and I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see the sugar prices further increasing by Rs 1. If you have the huge inventory carried by all these companies, in fact I have estimated and given the inventory gain about Rs 250 crore in Triveni Engineering, about Rs 200 crore in Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Rs 225 crore in Dwarikesh Sugar, I think these inventory gain is going to get hardened and situation going forward again is looking very robust. Maharashtra probably for the next season will record 70 percent production growth in the sugar because last year or in the current season, sugar production was low.  So, you have umpteen number of positive triggers which are in fact I sometimes feel that market was unable to catch any of this positive trigger and I have been repeatedly saying for last one week and I continue to have my positive bias and I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see the UP based sugar mills, these four or five sugar stocks moving up by about 15 percent in next couple of months from the current levels."

If one does not own Reliance, one should. However, now as we speak, after that small correction Reliance has turned up and it is giving a sense that it is going towards Rs 1600. So in any case and even a short-term trader think of Reliance as a buy idea now.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Asian Paints is a buying opportunity. It is a favourite stock of mine. A small correction is probably over; fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) should outperform and would be the reason why the Nifty goes up, if it does, FMCG and Reliance,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;quot;I am not very sure about the banks. The banks could go up, they may do minor contribution, I do not know. Apart from Asian Paints we have DLF.

So there is something going on in DLF which is worth buying.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Autos is an outperformer. Hero Moto has done well and it is now on the verge of breaking after a small correction. There are a lot of good quality stocks that have corrected together with the Nifty and are now giving a sense of breaking out. So if at all a Nifty trade is taken, as I suggested, it should be only on the long side for me,&amp;quot; he added.  &amp;quot;There are two short ideas - Arvind, which is going through some distribution. These are short selling ideas, try to keep them intraday and GAIL India; it is relatively weak but short selling should be done only intraday.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;It is possible that Lupin is turning around but yesterday was the first day that it saw a rally after months of decline. So I would rather wait. Pharmaceutical is bottoming out, it is difficult to say one day is enough but it is worth watching. I wouldn't buy it now.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;I do not have much conviction in ITC. I think it will go sideways. It will go up on one day and go down. There was a big rally. It could require weeks to consolidate and get out of that consolidation.

It added that the transfer will be effective from July 1.  Founded in 2006, Burrp was a prominent player in the restaurant discovery space until it lost ground to competitor Zomato.  BookMyShow has been focusing on transforming into a complete entertainment destination as it faces competition from new players like Paytm.  &amp;quot;Movie going in India is a social activity and food is an integral part of it.

Reliance Industries(RIL) and its partner BP Plc of the UK last week announced that they are moving ahead with development of three fields in the KG-D6 block off the east coast of India. Investment of Rs 40,000 crore in the development of the fields is expected to produce 30-35 million cubic meters of gas a day (mmscmd) by year 2020-2022.  &amp;quot;The planned investment will increase RIL's exposure to Indian gas business, which is extremely challenging given the delays in regulatory approvals, retrospective changes in regulations and slow resolution of disputes. RIL is already in arbitration with the regulator for costs previously incurred in the KG-D6 block,&amp;quot; Moody's said in its Issuer Comment.  It said, given the regulatory environment, the timing of both the investments and cash flows from the project remains uncertain.  &amp;quot;Two fields in the KG-D6 block that are already producing gas have seen a sharp decline in production of 60 mmscmd in 2010 to 7.8 mmscmd in 2017. The company has attributed the decline to more-than-expected complexity of the reservoirs. If the new fields also exhibit the same kind of complexity, the cash flows from the project could be much lower,&amp;quot; it said.  RIL-BP estimate that the fields have 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas resources, which could be monetised with these investments.  The investment is subject to approval by the Government of the development plans which RIL and BP plan to submit before end of 2017.  The companies will only move forward when the development plans are approved by the government and their respective board of directors.  &amp;quot;We expect the development plans will be approved in stages and the investments will be mostly back ended,&amp;quot; it said.  RIL owns 60 per cent interest in the block and its share of investment will be Rs 24,000 crore. &amp;quot;We expect minimal investments in fiscal ending March 2018 and the annual investments will be about Rs 6,000 crore after that, which will increase borrowings and leverage,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  While relative to RIL's total EBITDA of Rs 56,800 crore in fiscal 2017, the amount will have little impact on its credit metrics, the annual investment amount is disproportionately higher than the cash flows being generated by its upstream segment.  RIL's upstream segment reported a pre-tax loss of Rs 1,600 crore in fiscal 2017.  &amp;quot;This implies that the upstream business will drain cash from the rest of the business from fiscal 2018 until production begins from these blocks. This adds further drag on RIL's refining and petrochemical businesses which are already supporting the company's Rs 3 lakh crore (USD 47 billion) capex program over last four years in its energy and telecom businesses,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  Currently, RIL is only getting USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit for its current gas production from the KG-D6 block. But the new fields are entitled to a higher rate, which is capped at USD 5.56.  RIL-BP plan to award soon the contracts for development of the first field &ndash; R-Series, deep water gas fields located in water-depths of more than 2,000 meters, approximately 70 km offshore.  The companies expect to produce up to 12 mmscmd, with first production in 2020.  &amp;quot;At current gas price ceiling of USD 5.5 per million Btu, this level of production can generate USD 860 million (Rs 5,500 crore) of annual revenues for the block.  &amp;quot;If the three new fields together manage to achieve production volumes of 30-35 mmscmd of natural gas, they could generate annual revenues of USD 2.2-2.5 billion, of which RIL's share will be USD 1.3-1.5 billion,&amp;quot; it said.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;."

The stock recouped early losses to trade at Rs 1,385.75, up 0.09 percent from previous close, at 11:44 hours IST.  RIL and BP on Thursday announced that they are moving forward to develop already-discovered deepwater gas fields, bringing new gas production for India. Both companies will award contracts to progress development of the 'R-series' deep water gas fields in block KG-D6 off the east coast of India.  The project is expected to produce up to 12 million cubic metres of gas a day, coming to stream in 2020, the company said, adding development of three projects, with total investment of Rs 40,000 crore, is expected to bring in total 30-35 million cubic metres of gas a day new domestic gas production onstream, phased over 2020-2022.  Reliance Industries has 60 percent participating interest in KG-D6 block while BP has 30 percent and Niko 10 percent.  CLSA | Rating Buy | Target Rs 1,710  The partnership has also been expanded beyond upstream to focus on fuel marketing, unconventional energy and new technology initiatives, to deliver value to customers.  The two companies also advanced their collaboration beyond conventional upstream. Firstly, this venture will expand in conventional fuel and ATF marketing. Pertinently, BP already has a licence to market aviation turbine fuel and set up 3,500 fuel stations in India. Secondly, the partnership plans to also look at opportunities in unconventional fuels and low carbon energy sources. This should encompass solar, wind and gas amongst other things. Thirdly, the JV will look to employ digitisation and develop futuristic and innovative solutions to deliver disruptive value, which can also be taken to other parts of the world.  Plan to develop existing discoveries in D6 is a long-term positive. At the same time, this new JV on downstream should remove any doubts on whether Reliance is focussed to expand in fuel marketing. Nonetheless, near-term stock performance will be driven by start of projects worth over USD 40 billion in the next 6-9 months. CLSA has reiterated buy call on the stock.  Morgan Stanley | Rating Overweight | Target Rs 1,506  RIL's announcement related to investment in upstream, which was slightly above expectations, while the collaboration with BP in expanding investment in conventional fuels, unconventional mobility solutions and addressing electrification, sets the tone for RIL's growth plans.  Both upstream and fuel retail expansion have been well flagged; the overall growth in capex being around 10 percent above estimates. While there were limited details on retail fuel collaboration, BP has adopted a selective approach towards retail network expansion and it believes it will co-exist and not compete with incumbent retailers.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch | Rating Neutral | Target Rs 1,450  While it is good that RIL has decided to restart projects in D6, these are currently long dated projects.  The new D6 fields could add USD 1.3 billion (2 percent) to RIL sum-of-the-parts, but more importantly drive core earnings growth post the ongoing chemical projects (in the FY21-22 period).  The new energy partnership is still in early stages and needs definition. Spending, inflow on this will take time.  In the near term, the RIL stock should depend on Reliance Jio's revenue fortunes, which may become clear only around September/December 2017. With 5 percent upside potential, it stayed neutral on the stock.  JPMorgan | Rating Neutral | Target Rs 1,310  Given that both announcements are more medium-term impact events, JPMorgan sees limited uplift to the near-term stock price.  Given that the first of the incremental gas is not before 2020 and the full ramp up would be only in 2022, the research house sees limited financial impact till FY20.  The capital spend of around USD 1 billion a year is also very manageable for RIL, it feels. The increase in KG-D6 investments comes together with increasing CBM investments by the company.  While current gas prices are low, so are capital costs for developing these fields. RIL's ability to make counter cyclical investments is a key positive as it continues to de-risk the earnings profile from energy prices, JPMorgan said.  Credit Suisse | Rating Neutral  RIL/BP's a new strategic partnership, aiming to explore opportunities in differentiated fuels, mobility and low carbon businesses, is very preliminary. Credit Suisse does not see it impacting its RIL investment thesis at the moment.  Capex, project timelines and peak output are broadly in line with prior RIL/BP guidance and already built into its models. Domestic E&amp;amp;amp;P only accounts for 4 percent of its RIL sum-of-the-parts.

The question is what this means to gas importer and regasifier Petronet LNG.  RK Garg, Director-Finance, Petronet LNG welcoming the new partnership between RIL and BP, says with the government targeting to increase the consumption of natural gas in the overall energy basket, there is a need for more domestic natural gas.  Currently natural gas consumption is around 6.5 percent which has to go up to 15 percent, said Garg. Production of domestic gas would help leverage more LNG import because domestic gas is cheaper than imported gas. &ldquo;So good for the country and consumer,&rdquo; he said.  On the business front, he says they are further looking to expand the Dahej Unit from 15 million tonnes (mt) to 17.5 mt by around 2019. The current 15 mt is fully available for usage and the Dahej plant along is meeting 70-80 percent of the country&rsquo;s imported gas requirement. Furthermore, he says the progress of Kochi to Mangalore pipeline is good under execution by Gail. So, if everything goes as per plan then by end of 2018 the pipeline would be read and the throughput at Kochi would increase.  For Mangalore to Bangalore that is Kochi to Mangalore and then to Bangalore via Tamil Nadu, the discussions are still one, says Garg.  Kochi refineries has been expanded and the volumes have now increased and FACT is of taking the volume right now. The current utilisation of Kochi is 13-14-15 percent as compared to 5 percent earlier. As of now there are two major consumers for Kochi that is FACT and BPCL and utilisation depends on their oftake.  Going forward if profits are good and there is sufficient cash on the books, then shareholders would be duly rewarded via dividends but the decision will be taken by the Board, says Garg.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Sonia: First I wanted to ask you your view on Reliance Industries and what kind of net present value (NPV) up move are we essentially looking at post the announcements that came in yesterday?  A: Yesterday I expressed my view post the press conference because if you take a call now, right now I won&rsquo;t be taking a call on the monetisation or the earnings calculation on 30-35 mmscmd which we will be seeing from three projects. However, 12 mmscmd is being considered that too that will start coming in from 2020. If you take a call because unless and until you have a price realisation, because there have been uncovered questions which have not been answered or there have been lot many things disconnect. One on the schedule or period of the capex of Rs 40,000 crore, but apart from that, the unanswered question is what kind of realisations we are expecting from the gas.  Even if take USD 7.5 per mmbtu for the gas which will be seen from first of the field, i.e. &lsquo;R&rsquo; field, and if I take a 12 mmscmd as the production, the revenue is estimated, in fact I don&rsquo;t think that anyone has given the quantum of that which is very important, the turnover works out at Rs 8,000 crore and I don&rsquo;t think that the EBITDA of more than 40-45 percent can get expected. So, it is very difficult to take a call that what kind of investments because the investments amount having invested earlier on all these fields have not seen having yield any results.  Rs 32 crore having invested in British Petroleum (BP), again both the promoters were silent on that that what has been the fate of the earlier investments having made and what will go into the amount of this Rs 40,000 crore on the field and off the field i.e. in the sea either for creating the fuel stations and all that and how much will be for the gas exploration. So, it is difficult to take a call.  However, still if you want to take a call, I won&rsquo;t be taking it very significant, maybe an amount of Rs 20-25 can be attributed to the net present value, taking the value as of today discounting the 2020 earnings which I said which can yield an turnover of about Rs 8,300 crore calculating at the USD 7.5 realisation per mmbtu.  Anuj: You have a stock idea for our viewers today?  A: I am recommending Aksharchem. This is a dye and dye intermediates company. If you recall, last March 30, I have given the indications when suddenly the prices of dye and dye intermediates started moving in and this time also there are I won&rsquo;t name the two listed companies which may be affected but in Padra near Vadodara, the pollution problem is seen cropping up which will be seen negative for two of the companies, in fact three companies are getting affected severely because of that and I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see the stoppage of the production also. So, that will be seen as an advantage to Aksharchem because Aksharchem is a fully pollution control compliant and second company is Bhageria Industries on which I am director as a matter of disclosure.  Both the companies are in no way affected. I am not saying that because I am director but that is the ground situation. Two listed companies which are operating in Padra, they are facing the pollution problems. So, whenever these kinds of events happen, you have to foresee these events, when they happen suddenly you see the prices of H-acid and vinyl sulphone starts moving up which are the two critical raw material for making dyes. In fact for making dyes, both are dye intermediates. Aksharchem is a market leader in vinyl sulphone controlling 45 percent of the market from India to exports and that is the reason the FY17 has been excellent for all these dye intermediate makers.  If you see the company in FY17, they have shown a topline growth of 40 percent to about Rs 265 crore, but PAT has tripled. PAT has shown more than 200 percent growth. PAT has increased from Rs 17 crore to Rs 52 crore. So any pollution control lapses on part of the other three plants which are operating in Padra, Vadodara of which two are listed, if that has any reflection, the major orders will flow to the company like Aksharchem and all that. Apart from that, the company is carrying out the capex of about Rs 175 crore. They are the world leader in CPC Green which is dye about controlling 10 percent of the market and they are putting up fresh capacity in the dye and dye intermediate space.  H-acid 1,200 tonne per annum, violet 2,300 tonne per annum, CPC Green 2,200 tonner per annum, total capex of about Rs 175 crore to be met from the internal accruals. I am expecting that probably in next six to eight months, or 6-12 months, all the products will go operational. So, taking all this into consideration, debt free balance sheet, promoter stake of 70 percent, EPS was Rs 71 in FY17 which I am expecting to move up in this year also, I have not quantified the amount. So, taking all this into consideration, share is now ruling below Rs 760 looks a good buy and can move to a level of Rs 945 in next six months or so.

So, people have essentially booked profits there or they have covered their shorts. The longs are still to built-up and the stock has gone up 7 percent this series, 2 percent yesterday.

The two companies would also jointly explore opportunities in the entire energy value chain including fuel retailing and renewables with support from the vast technology and telecom infrastructure that the Mukesh Ambani group has set up.  Ambani and BP Group Chief Executive Bob Dudley addressed a press conference today in Delhi to make the announcement. Earlier in the day, they met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Minister of State (independent charge) for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan.  &ldquo;We are quite enthused with present investment proposal we have and that we are all set to bring the true potential of KG-D6 to India and the people of India. It is high time we produced our own gas and not import it when we have our own,&rdquo; Ambani said in reply to a media query.  Development of the three projects is expected to ultimately bring in 30-35 million cubic metres (1 billion cubic feet) of gas by the time all come to fruition in 2022.  The first project is the &lsquo;R-series&rsquo; deepwater gas field in Block KGD6 off the east coast of India. The project (D34) is a dry gas development one in water-depths of more than 2,000 metres, approximately 70 kilometres offshore. The project is expected to produce up to 12 million cubic metres (425 million cubic feet) of gas a day, coming onstream in 2020.  A joint press release by RIL&nbsp;and BP said the two companies planned to submit development plans for the next two projects -- Satellites and D55 -- for government approval before the end of this year. The implementation of these two projects will be subject to government approval.  Gas produced over the life of these three new projects could generate up to USD 20 billion in import substitution (at current imported LNG prices) and employment of up to 20,000 skilled labour during the construction period over the next 5 years.  RIL, BP and Canada&rsquo;s Niko Resources have a 60:30:10 joint venture that owns and operates multiple oil and gas blocks in India, including the producing block KGD6.  The two companies, since the beginning of their alliance in 2011, have so far invested Rs. 10,000 crore in deepwater exploration and production.  India today consumes over 5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas and aims to double gas consumption by 2022. Gas production from the integrated development is expected to help reduce India&rsquo;s import dependence and amount to over 10 percent of the country&rsquo;s projected gas demand in 2022.  While no details were given, both Dudley and Ambani said the strategic partnership announced between the two covered downstream activities and fuel retailing.  &ldquo;So what we have announced today is a strategic partnership that goes into the downstream as well as marketing. So you would not expect to see BP doing these alone or on our own. We would like to work with Reliance and that&rsquo;s part of the announcement today,&rdquo; Dudley said.  The companies will also evaluate opportunities in trading that could optimize the value of existing products like oil, gas, fuels, LNG, power and carbon. They will also look at working together on carbon emissions trading, and share knowledge around technology and management practices.  &ldquo;Under this new cooperation our two companies will jointly explore options to develop differentiated fuels, mobility and advanced low carbon energy businesses in India. We expect to collaborate, in addition to the conventional fuels and aviation marketing, on unconventional mobility solutions, addressing electrification, digitization and disruptive mobility trends,&amp;quot; Ambani said. &amp;quot;Together, these collaborations will seek to address the mobility needs of urban, rural/farm, industrial/commercial, and highway consumers in India, applying the leading capabilities of both BP and Reliance.&rdquo;  He said the companies will explore opportunities in both conventional and unconventional fuels with the whole objective being to not do what was &ldquo;old world&rdquo;. He said low carbon and renewable energy was very much on the company&rsquo;s drawing board.

Reliance already operates about 1,500 fuel retail outlets in the country, a small number compared to the nearly 56,000 owned by Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL.&nbsp;It has, however, indicated in the past it would&nbsp;want to ramp up this number following the government's decision to deregulate diesel prices.   Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices Works   The deal could be a game-changer for Reliance, BP and Indian customers together, oil expert Narendra Taneja said. BP, which is looking at new markets, will bring in new technologies which the current state-run oil marketing companies lack.  India is one fastest growing market for petroleum and oil, and the &lsquo;tested partnership&rsquo; of Reliance-BP will benefit the customers.  SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com and Taneja both believe that the BP-Reliance partnership will go beyond fuel retail.  The partnership is likely to extend to natural gas, which the government too has been pushing for. Taneja said that LNG and CNG outlets are likely to be a part of the game plan for the companies.  &ldquo;There are opportunities worth USD 30-40 billion for the companies,&rdquo; Taneja said. The gas plans could be put in place in next one year.  This is the time for Reliance to expand refining and retail outlet capacities, which can be done through this partnership, Tulsian said. The investment magnitude has to be USD 12-15 billion here.  The partnership will also end monopoly of state-run companies in the fuel retailing.  RIL and BP already have investments in the KG-D6 basin, which they plan to start production in 2021-2022. BP holds 30 percent interest in the block that&nbsp;Reliance operates.  BP received approval to set up petrol pump in India last year. The company had cited investment of nearly USD 500 million in oil and gas exploration and production for the licence.

CLSA, in a report, reiterated its bullish call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,710, implying an upside potential of 29 percent. It places its bet on the developments around its telecom service, Jio.  &ldquo;After improving voice and data service quality over the past few months, we expect Jio to take the next step to monetisation. Also, we see Jio launching an affordable 4G feature phone within 2QFY18,&rdquo; the brokerage said in its report.  The brokerage highlighted that the company could be focussed on plugging holes to further improve its services. &ldquo;&hellip;Some speed test results also indicate that data speeds have been at an appreciable level in recent few months. After the past few months of stable services, Jio&rsquo;s focus should shift to monetisation but it remains to be seen if it goes from the current 66 percent discount to full tariff in one go or in steps,&rdquo; it added.  Apart from this, the likely start of its fixed broadband service should enable it to expand its target market beyond 4G smartphone users and add legs to its growth, it added. &ldquo;This would allow Jio to target nearly 30% of Indian mobile data users who still prefer feature phones,&rdquo; the report added.  Along with the likely start of its fixed broadband service, this should enable it to expand its target market beyond 4G smartphone users and add legs to its growth.  The next big event for the stock could be the annual general meeting, the report stated. &ldquo;The AGM, possibly in July, could be a key event for further announcements on Jio, projects and future cash use,&rdquo; the report stated.

Data generated by PMJDY and its linkages with Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) can be a &amp;quot;delight for different set of analytics&amp;quot; and can be used to help the fast moving consumer goods, auto, telecom, insurance, agri sectors, it said.  An increased focus on the domestic front will be a &amp;quot;win-win&amp;quot; for both the country as well as the IT industry, it said, calling for a high level task force consisting of IT industry and the Government.  The lobby's secretary general D S Rawat claimed &amp;quot;lakhs of new jobs&amp;quot; can be created through the focus on domestic opportunity which can make up for the losses due to upheavals in global markets and changing technologies.  The note comes months after Reliance Industries' Mukesh Ambani called the protectionist policies in US as a blessing in disguise for India.  (US President Donald) Trump can actually be a blessing in disguise. The domestic IT industry can focus on solving problems right here, which is a huge market,&amp;quot; Ambani had said in February."

Local companies will be chosen as strategic partners that can combine with foreign firms to manufacture single-engine fighter aircraft, helicopters, submarines and armoured vehicles, according to the document.  New Delhi hopes the yet-to-be-finalised &amp;quot;Strategic Partnership&amp;quot; model will boost the role of private companies, grow India's small defence industry, which is dominated by state-run companies, and end its role as the world's largest arms importer.  Officials from Tata Sons, Reliance Industries, Larsen and Toubro and Adani Enterprises among others attended a presentation made by defence and finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday, a defence ministry official said.  New Delhi will use a range of financial and technical criteria to pick companies for &amp;quot;design, development and manufacturing of strategic (defence) platforms for future,&amp;quot; the document showed, without naming any company.  The ministry of defence said in a statement that Jaitley had met with industry representatives on Thursday to discuss the proposed model but did not go into specific details.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to reverse India's dependence on imports by building a local manufacturing industry. The government is forecast to spend $250 billion on modernisation of its armed forces over the next decade.  Industry experts say delays in finalising procurement policies have undermined India's efforts to get local, largely inexperienced, companies to tie up with foreign manufacturers, a necessary step if domestic firms are to utilise the latest technology.  Foreign manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems and Saab are looking to India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Saab and Lockheed are both pitching for an estimated 200 to 250 fighter jets that the Indian Air Force says it needs.  Ankur Gupta, Vice President, Aerospace and Defence at consultancy EY said the strategic partnership policy would &amp;quot;give the much-needed impetus to private companies and build their business case to make serious long-term investments in India.&amp;quot;  Among the basic requirements under the plan, Indian firms must have a consolidated turnover for each of the last three years of more than 40 billion rupees ($621 million) to qualify, the document said.  Six Indian companies will be shortlisted, and will then choose among several foreign partners.  Indian companies will be permitted to speak with multiple foreign firms to work out a tie-up, but can only offer to work together with one of them at the time of bidding.  The helicopters, submarines, armoured fighter vehicles and fighter jet orders are expected to be multi-billion-dollar deals."

Nonetheless, the later part of the week saw a correction in the other heavyweight&rsquo;s pack that dragged down the index to close down below the 9,300 mark.  The macro-technical alert in the form of break in international commodities that was raised seems to have acted, to say the least. This brings us to the juncture, where a risk-off status may set in for next few days.  This may set into a correction towards 9,190 levels, followed by the 6-week low placed at 9,020. After a stellar move seen in the past few weeks, the profit booking in the heavyweights is certainly welcome; though it seems quite evenly balanced.  Here is a list of top five stocks to buy based on technical factors in the short term:  Indiabulls Housing Finance: BUY| Target Rs 1300| Stop Loss Rs 993| Return 17%  The stock is an outperformer within the market and the NBFC pack as the scrip has sustained the correction very well. A breakout of 6 weeks of consolidation above the Rs 1,000 mark has led it onto a new 52-week high on the back of good volume pickup.  We expect a move up to 1175 (around 5%) from current levels, which if crossed further may move onto Rs 1,300. A stop loss maybe placed a bit into the consolidation zone placed at Rs993.  Avenue Supermarts: BUY| Target Rs 900| Stop Loss Rs 786 | Return 11%  After proving to be a double-bagger on the listing, the scrip had shown a stellar move till mid-April. The prices have consolidated over the last 3 weeks in a band of Rs806-720 while maintaining a strong undertone which is a positive sign.  It has moved on to a fresh high of Rs814.40, on large volumes over the past few days. The same is accompanied by a surge in momentum.  We expect a move onto Rs850 and then extrapolated to Rs900 with a stop loss placed half way into the breakout band placed at Rs786.  ZEE Entertainment Enterprises: SELL| Target Rs 467| Stop Loss Rs 537| Return 7%  The stock witnessed a classic head &amp;amp;amp; shoulders breakdown, below the Rs511 mark, accompanied by high volumes is a big red flag in the scrip prices.  The head to the neckline is defined by around 44 pints (511 to 555) spanning over two shoulders created in March &amp;amp;amp; Mat 2017. The target maybe placed around Rs467 mark (44 points below the neckline).  A fair risk-reward seems possible with a stop loss for the trade be placed at Rs537, a bit above the right shoulder.  Biocon: SELL| Target Rs 972| Stop Loss Rs 1086| Return 6%  A gradual price move from March 2017, has met with a faster retracement, wherein prices have broken below the 2-month low of around Rs1,042.  The said retracement has taken place on the back of Heavy volumes (around 4-5 times of averages). Prices in the recent few days have remained extremely volatile with the majority of the days showing a negative candle, an indication of consistent selling at every higher level.  A dipping RSI around 39 indicates the waning strength in the prices. Prices are ripe for a correction onto the 200-DMA placed at 972. The stop may be placed a bit above the 38.1% retracement of current fall at a level of Rs1,086.  Reliance Industries: SELL| Target Rs 1,230| Stop Loss Rs 1,399| Return 7%  In line with the overall weak trajectory in the commodities sector (a 1.75% correction in the index over the week), the prices have remained falling off the cliff over the whole of last 2 weeks.  The last week saw a break below the 5-week low placed at Rs1,347 accompanied by a substantial rise in the delivered quantity indicating a consistent selling at higher levels with the prices waning all through the week.  The RSI after having reached overbought levels around 72 has softened off to 45, showing a waning strength. The prices are on course for a break below the gap created in March 2017 between 1325-1311, that may be followed by a correction towards the 3-month LOWS around the 1230 mark.  The bearish view would stand negated only on a closing above the 5th May&rsquo;s high placed at the Rs1,399 mark.  Disclaimer: The author is AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Anuj: Quite a rocky week specially towards the end. On Friday we did see the market closing at low point but is it presenting a buying opportunity, what would be your prognosis for Nifty and Bank Nifty now?  A: On the Nifty we are still rangebound. We haven&rsquo;t broken down from the range although today looked like a fairly strong down day but I would think that as long as 9,250-9,270 holds on, maybe this is more a midcap type correction. The other thing is that ICICI Bank has had a strong breakout and if Reliance can probably bounce back from support, the largecap indices could be supported.  The other thing is that this new ordinance which has come out, the Bank Nifty did not react too badly to that. So it is possible that the PSU bank rally resumes, the corporate lender rally basically resumes. So I am not too negative on either the Nifty or the Bank Nifty, you could have more sideways for sure but possibly the midcaps could have a bit of a deeper downmove. I would still buy closer to 9,250 on the Nifty.  Sonia: For next week, since you mentioned public sector undertaking (PSU) banks, are there any fresh buys that you will recommend in any of the PSU names either the frontliners or even the midcaps?  A: All of these guys, Bank of India (BoI), Union Bank, Canara Bank, while they did come off from the highs, they did not close at the lows. So if you get any sort of decline from here maybe 3-5 percent style decline, you should buy into them because if the market would have taken the policy negatively, these guys should have been down 8-10 percent. So today&rsquo;s reaction is quite positive. They may not immediately start rallying but I think people are still buying into them and we should see higher levels on all of these midcap PSU banks particularly.  Anuj: Your own stock ideas for next week?  A: Given that oil is weak, I am taking on stocks which are oil sensitive. Berger Paints can be bought out there, we are expecting targets of Rs 300 on Berger Paints. Most paint companies have done well, even Asian Paints. Similarly on Jet Airways, we are expecting targets closer to Rs 600, again aviation did well although the market was under pressure. These are stocks which can outperform even in a market which is a bit soft. On microfinance, I think the way Ujjivan Financial Services has broken down below its 200-day moving average (DMA), we could see levels of Rs 260-280. So this is a short sell that people can play into.  Sonia: There is a new segment that we have introduced where we will try to interact with our twitter followers. We have a couple of queries coming in. Kamal Arora has written to us saying that he has purchased 100 shares of Glenmark at Rs 750 and he says he can hold it for one year, should he hold or sell?  A: First of all it is important to understand that this is not the time of pharmaceuticals or IT. So he is making money because Glenmark happens to be in a Rs 750-950 type of range. Each time it gets to Rs 950, you need to exit. Yes, there will come a time when pharma stocks get back into a bull market but this is not their bull market. So if you are making money, take it off. Again enter at Rs 750 and it looks like you will get there fairly soon.  Anuj: We have Saptarshi De and he has bought two of your favourite names, Sobha Developers at Rs 390 and HDFC at Rs 1,380 and he is a long-term investor.  A: He has bought both stocks, which are performing in this current bull market. Sobha he can easily keep Rs 360 type of a stop, real estate will re-resume its rally, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) impact will still get factored in and things will get cleaned out in that space. I would think Sobha can easily double from here. It has got clean balance sheet, it is a good developer, so he has bought it fairly near the bottom so nothing to worry on that.  Similarly, HDFC, again good price to buy and housing finance remains a theme, although it will not move like a Can Fin Home but chances are as long as this bull market sustains, housing finance will be a theme if you want to add on any declines towards Rs 1,500-1,520, it is a good place to add and I would expect Rs 1,700-1,750 in the times to come on HDFC.  Sonia: Megh Kenia says that Bhushan Steel after the new steel policy coming in today, is it a buy or a sell from current level?  A: Bhushan Steel has other problems other than the steel policy and metals are not doing very well. So if he has recently bought it maybe keep a stop of Rs 70-72 and while it is in a decent uptrend, but given the way the sector is moving, I am not very positive. If metal start to turnaround, he could get Rs 90-95 but I like to be in spaces where the sector is outperforming. So I would still be much rather trying to buy reactions on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) rather than bet on metals because metals overall are not looking very good.

After last month's government decision to give coal bed methane (CBM) producers freedom to discover market price, RIL invited bids from users of gas.  Five companies including RIL participated in the bidding process, according to the bid evaluation report the company posted on its website.  The bidders besides RIL were Deepak Fertilizer &amp;amp;amp; Petrochemicals Corp Ltd, state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd and GMR's Rajahmundry and Vemagiri power plants.  While RIL bid USD 4.23 per mmBtu price for using the gas at its petrochemical plants at Patalganga and Nagothane in Maharashtra and Jamnagar in Gujarat, Deepak Fertilizer was a close second bidding USD 4.159. GAIL put in a bid of USD 4.009 while GMR quoted USD 2.48 per mmBtu for both the plants.  The price discovered is almost the same as USD 4.205 per mmBtu price fixed for RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 gas field for first five years of production beginning April 2009.  A sixth bid from Asahi India Glass Ltd was rejected as it quoted for 0.51 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) which &amp;quot;exceeds the available CBM gas volume for sale of 0.40 mmscd,&amp;quot; the evaluation report of its CBM gas bids said.  The bid document stipulates that &amp;quot;the volume quoted by the bidder shall not be lesser than 0.05 mmscmd or shall not exceed 0.40 mmscmd (approximate volume expected to be available for sale),&amp;quot; the report said, adding that in view of this the bid by Asahi was not considered.  The six bids put in a total requirement of 2.16 mmscmd as against the available volume of 0.40 mmscmd.  Through the April 13 notification, the oil ministry had stated that a CBM producer has to call for open bids for sale of coal gas and seek price quotes to discover the market price.  The process prescribed was the same as the one RIL had run in 2012 to discover a price for CBM gas it is to produce in Madhya Pradesh. Back in 2012, it had sought bids for 3.5 mmscmd (as against 0.40 mmscmd put on offer this time) of coal gas from its Sohagpur CBM block in Madhya Pradesh at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 percent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.  At USD 100 per barrel oil price prevalent that year, CBM from RIL's Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. At USD 55 a barrel rate currently, it would cost USD 7.2. That formula was, however, rejected by the ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.  This time, RIL sought bids in form of a a deductible from Platts DES West India price of USD 7.659 per MMBtu.  RIL bid deducting 3.429 per MMBtu while Deepak put in (-) 3.5 bid. GAIL quoted a deduction of 3.65 and GMR 5.179.  &amp;quot;In the event of market-discovered price being less than the price notified by the Petroleum Planning Analysis Cell (PPAC) under the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014, the royalty and production level payment (PLP) shall be paid on the basis of the latter,&amp;quot; the CBM pricing policy notified last month said.  The PPAC notified price of gas for April 1 to September 30 at USD 2.48 per mmBtu and the same for difficult areas is USD 5.56 per mmBtu, lower than the rate in RIL formula.  &amp;quot;Sale of CBM to any affiliate of the contractor is permitted, in the event the contractor cannot identify any buyer following the procedure (of open bidding),&amp;quot; the policy said, adding that the reasons for sale to affiliates will have to be notified to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).

Steel scrap, a substitute of sponge iron, is trading at a significant premium that should drive demand. Finally, the company is debt-free with a cash per share of Rs 369.  The CK Birla Group promoted HIL (Hyderabad Industries) produces roofing solutions, panels, walling blocks, plywood substitutes, high-quality pipes and fittings, and industrial insulation. Despite the 40 percent run-up in the stock, the valuation looks reasonable.  Menon Bearings produces bi-metal engine bearings, bushes and thrust washers for light and heavy automobile engines, two-wheeler engines and compressors for refrigerators and air conditioners. It also offers aluminium die casting component under &ldquo;ALKOP&rdquo; brand. The company derives 78 percent of revenue from bearing and bushes and 22 percent from ALKOP. The share of exports stands at 28 percent. &nbsp;An interesting idea that warrants some patience after the 55 percent run-up in the past year.    Rushil D&eacute;cor, which is into the manufacturing of laminated sheets and MDF and Hatsun Agro is the largest private sector dairy company in India. Both these companies have been a favourite of savvy investors for a while and despite their strong show, valuation doesn&rsquo;t lend comfort.  We would also like to highlight some decent numbers from some completely unknown names.    Tracking the unknown names for discovering future winners is key to investing success. Hence, all the winners spotted here deserve attention.  (Disclosure: RIL, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18 and&nbsp;moneycontrol.com)."

Analysts, too, have given the numbers their thumbs-up as well.  The petrochemical major's quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations on Monday as profit on a standalone basis grew by 1.6 percent sequentially to Rs 8,151 crore for January-March quarter. Net income on consolidated basis rose 7 percent to Rs 8,053 crore QoQ.  Standalone revenue from operations during the quarter increased 12 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 74,598 crore while consolidated revenue soared 10.33 percent to Rs 92,889 crore, the company said in its filing.  Reliance reported gross refining margin for the quarter at USD 11.50 a barrel, which was far ahead of analysts' estimates of USD 11 a barrel and outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.2 a barrel. It had posted GRM at 10.8 a barrel in December quarter.  The company&rsquo;s stock was in the news recently when it surpassed Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in terms of market capitalisation and also became the most valued company in the country. Analysts have largely given positive calls on the stock, driven by a reduction of capex cycle in sight and better metrics in the results.  Citi maintained its buy call on the stock with an increase in its bull case target to Rs 1,923 due to higher Jio valuation and lower peak net debt. It believes that the company&rsquo;s outperformance could sustain as the earnings are at an inflection point. Among key risks to the stock are weakening in refining fundamentals and global petrochemical spreads, the research firm added.  Analysts at the firm termed the company&rsquo;s March quarter performance as strong, with the standalone EBITDA being 3 percent ahead of estimates. Meanwhile, the profit after tax (PAT) was largely in line, it said. Gross refining margins of USD 11.5 per barrel were above its estimates, it said.  On the company&rsquo;s capex plans, it sees standalone capex being lesser than USD 2.5 billion in FY18. Jio&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter of the fiscal will be similar to March quarter before declining sharply, it said.  Nomura maintained its buy call on the stock as well, but with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,540. The brokerage house observed that the net profit was 1-2 percent ahead of its estimates, driven by lower tax rate. It too feels that the recent outperformance of the company could sustain.  However, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and profit before tax (PBT) were below its estimates on the back of higher depreciation and lower other income. These numbers too were partly offset by lower finance costs, it added.  Going forward, it sees earnings growing ahead once Jio, petchem and refining expansion projects start to deliver. It expects consolidated EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 19 percent/15 percent, respectively over FY16-20.  Meanwhile, it observed that high capex on Jio continued during the quarter and expects similar capex in Q1 of this fiscal. The near-term focus will be on addition in customers of Jio. Having said that, it feels that the large capex cycle is coming to an end.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded the stock to neutral, but increased the target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,375. The global brokerage firm observed that the firm&rsquo;s March quarter net profit was 9 percent above estimates, while refining beat was led by GRM.  Analysts at the firm now have the focus on Jio&rsquo;s success and the capex cycle. They believe that a further rerating on the stock is contingent on a successful Jio P&amp;amp;amp;L as well as falling capex. It further added that while capex could decline, there is limited visibility on a successful Jio P&amp;amp;amp;L.  The stock could find support from growth in Jio&rsquo;s monthly subscribers, while weak margin, project startup hiccups and high capex were the key risks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has an overweight rating on the stock as it saw upside risks from improving energy margins as well as project executions. A steady project pipeline commissioning from FY18 should reduce the risk of further capex, it added.  JPMorgan is neutral on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 1,310 from Rs 1,240. While the lower capex in its core business was positive, Jio was the key unknown element, it said. Further extension of discounts by Jio would be negative, it added.  Rolling forward its valuation to FY19, Deutsche Bank raised its target by 10 percent to Rs 1,600. Lower downstream margins, policy vagaries were the key downside risks for stock, it said.  The stock has moved around 12 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain stood at 5 percent. At 11:04 hrs, Reliance Industries was quoting at Rs 1,437.90, up Rs 21.50, or 1.52 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,465.00.

Net income on consolidated basis rose 7 percent to Rs 8,053 crore QoQ.  Reacting to the results, market experts SP Tulsian, &nbsp;Deven Choksey, Sudip Bandopadhyay, Prakash Diwan and Sudeep Anand listed their views on the results.  Below is the interview transcript.  Anuj: The other number which is important is, and this could lead to a bit of an uptick on the stock tomorrow, is the Jio subscription number. 72 million was the last reported number, street was pencilling in 90-100 million. That number is now 108.9 million subscribers at the end March. 108.9 million subscribers, that is the number that we have. Thoughts on that number?   Tulsian: These are the excellent numbers. I do not think anyone has even really talked of the 11 crore kind of subscribers because everyone, if you have seen the optimists migration which people have been expecting was at about 70 percent. And at that time, it was expected that probably 10 crore has come as a free subscribers. So, even if we get to see 7-7.5 crore, it will be seen quite good. But if they have touched 10.89 crore subscribers and I think you can take that ballpark as 11 crore, that is phenomenal. Nobody must have thought of these kind of numbers.  Anuj: This petchem performance, they are talking about some softening in prices, PVC and a couple of others. But do you think the market will absorb that?   Tulsian: That has to do because if you really see this all petchem prices are always import parity prices and as I said, because of the strengthening rupee, you have seen that. But I see honestly, the very robust demand and actually that is seen getting reflected also. I have not seen the press release because we have been estimating petchem volume to be at 6.45 million metric tonne for this quarter and actually even if there is soft margin because of this strengthening rupee, probably that will get offset by the increased capacity because we have seen huge capacity additions having taken place in petchem. You have not seen any capacity addition happening for the company in any of the segments, whether it is the smaller one, whether it is upstream or in the refinery, but in petchem they have been going in a very aggressive way.  So, I will not be because we have seen the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins at 13 percent which otherwise was expected to be at 14.5-15 percent. So, even if there is a drop of about 150 basis point on the expectations on the EBIT margin, I do not think that market should really have complaint as long as it gets compensated with the higher volume.  Anuj: The petchem that you were looking at is 6.2 million metric tonnes.   Tulsian: I think this is actually the cause of disappointment because I have estimated petchem EBIT margin at Rs 3,690 crore on 6.45 million metric tonnes. So, I will not be disappointed to see the EBIT of Rs 3,441 on the lower volume of 6.2 which you have said just now because actually there has been robust demand of this petchem, polymer and polyester, both, in this quarter and probably, but on their overseas, they are very active in the overseas market also on the polymer and polyester. And when you talk to the overseas buyer maybe like in Nigeria and all that, they have been saying that they are getting the cheaper petchem, polymer in Nigeria than what the company sells. So, maybe a mix of overseas and domestic market probably has seen the lower offtake, but the margin is seen maintained on the absolute number.  Anuj: Stock is up 30 percent this month or this year rather. How much more from here on, on these numbers?   Choksey: On one side we have got the refining business expanding by one third capacity. This is happening in the second quarter of this financial year, we are with the commentary. On the other side, the feed stock changing is also happening in this particular quarter, maybe in the second quarter maybe we will be seeing the announcement coming in as to margin that they have produced. So again, on one side, volume improvement, second side, profitability improvement from crore business of refining.  Already the petrochemical polymer productions has started giving capacity of around 28,000 metric tonnes. So, that again is suggesting that volume wise, they would be growing far bigger in this particular space. So, core business itself is contributing significantly which is translating to somewhere around Rs 10 price-earnings ratio (P/E) from core business alone.  Look at the Jio business and interpret this business a little bit more. 11 crore subscribers with the current tariff, it translates to somewhere around Rs 40,000-41,000 crore worth of revenue. And somewhere around before interest, depreciation or amortisation, the profit could be somewhere around Rs 17,000-18,000 crore.  Now if this number translates to 20 crore subscribers which is most from the data business that this company is cultivating, my reading says that Jio alone would give you a valuation of around Rs 600 per share. Along with the retail business, it could easily add up to around Rs 1,00,000 crore of market cap if it is a separate business listed. So, put together, somewhere around Rs 1,800 kind of a price range for Reliance Industries is distinctly seen whether it happens now or six months down the line, one will have to field. But I think it should happen as far as the valuation goes.  Anuj: Your thoughts on what kind of reaction the market gives tomorrow?   Choksey: I have been maintaining that this is three years of bull phase which has started for Reliance and probably having seen all the Capex programmes completed in refining business, in petrochemical polymer businesses, also largely the Capex programme completing in the Jio business and retail business. All of these verticals are expected to produce some sizeable amount of revenue and profits. As I see it, the core business is still valued at around 10 price multiple which according to me holds a clear chance of rerating because of the one third improvement in the profit performance itself which is seen on the cards.  And other two business which have not started reflecting into the price could also reflect big time. Now, if the long only investors come into the market, they may probably take the position and in the short-term also the stock price could perform. But if you are holding two years and 2.5 years view from now, I see a possibility of more than double the stock price from current levels.  Anuj: It looks like it is a beat on most parameters. Clearly GRM and this Reliance Jio numbers standing out which really have been the big triggers for the company. Do you think the stock has legs to go even after the 30 percent rally?   Bandopadhyay: I think so. The result which they have come up with on both on GRM as well as looks like on the petchem side, core businesses which produce about two third and one third of their respective profits, they have done very well. Nobody expected USD 11 plus per barrel of GRM, so USD 11.5 per barrel is definitely great. Also remember, the Jio numbers which they have come up with is actually beyond expectations. So, if they can convert at least 50 percent of the numbers into a paying customers from the next quarter onwards, that itself will take Reliance to a different level. There is a little bit of disappointment on both the exploration piece and the retail. But having said that, from here on, at least 10 percent upside I do see in Reliance within the next six months.  Anuj: We have got all the numbers, USD 11.5 per barrel on GRM, we have 109 million subscribers for Reliance Jio. Your thoughts on how the stock moves from here?   Anand: Definitely the refinery side, it has surprised us positively. We were expecting slightly lower around USD 10.4 per barrel of GRM but they have delivered very strong GRM. On the petrochemical side, slightly disappointment. We had anticipated around Rs 36 billion of profit, but still the overall operating profit is pretty strong. And secondly Jio subscriber base of over 100 million is definitely one of the major positives for the company also.  Anuj: Your thoughts on what could be the fair value of the stock because Rs 1200-1250 is assumed as the fair value for the traditional business. So, based on these numbers where do you see the stock moving?   Diwan: It is on a trailing basis that Rs 1250-1260 sounds fairly good as a price. Secondly, we need to see it in the perspective that the stock is kind of playing catch up for the last 7-8 years that it hasn&rsquo;t kind of delivered on a CAGR basis. So, there is no arithmetic that says that it has to be in a linear progression. It could be a geometric progression in terms of price discovery. The current business, the traditional business, core business could also get valued at about Rs 1450-1500 which is what it is currently close to, you are getting the Jio business for free in the current price. Now it depends on whether you want to give the Jio business 2 years or 1 year and pencil that in, back of the envelope calculation is anywhere between Rs 500-650. Remember Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s words that, when he said we will have profitability margins in the mid-teens from the Jio business in some time.  If that happens we are talking about a dramatic change in the company&rsquo;s revenue stream, which brings down a lot of other costs as well which have been burdening the company on the interest side. So, my sense is Rs 2000 is what I would look at as a next threshold. Anything above Rs 2000 is where you would need to revaluate in terms of whether you want to book profits or whatever but from Rs 1400 to Rs 2000, I don&rsquo;t see the trajectory to be interrupted by anything very major.  Anuj: Your thoughts on tomorrow&rsquo;s reaction?   Diwan: My earlier target was more long term. The stock has had this feeling of saying it is overbought, it has over done, the upside has been too rapid but these numbers will give that validation for whoever has bought into it even at let us say about Rs 1300-1400 band. So, nobody is going to book profits. You will probably see a new wave of buying that will emerge post the expiry. I think the expiry is going to be a big milestone of sorts for which people would want to wait out because of the huge futures positions. However post that in the next few days I would see a lot of genuine buying which would come into the stock which will probably in the next week or so take it to that Rs 1500 plus mark as well.  Anuj: Tomorrow morning, what kind of verdict does the street give to Reliance numbers?   Tulsian: Looking to the momentum which we are seeing in the stock, people will definitely be taking these two or three things. In fact, you have said that petchem is a bit disappointment, but I do not agree, in fact I have satisfaction from all three core operations that is petchem refining and as well as Reliance Jio subscribers. So, obviously I am keeping a positive view. Earlier I have been giving a price target of Rs 1,350-1,400, but probably market should receive well these results and maybe an upside of about Rs 50 can be expected largely because of the technical factor till expiry maybe in the next three days because people are short in the counter as well so some kind of short covering and informed buying and people, those who have been holding the long positions will see that expiry happens on a positive note.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Anuj: We were discussing this yesterday when the numbers came but you would have looked at all the numbers now, what is the call on Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) at current levels?  A: The first call was the things are good, it could only improve and I think the numbers have just validated that. People are talking about this disappointment in the petchem, EBITDA and things like that but we need to understand that the company is in constant capacity enhancement either it is augmenting the technology or it is expanding sheer capacity. Today the kind of USD 5 arbitrage between Singapore and its gross refining margins (GRMs) means that this is a quasi-mode that is developing for the company. So even if there is a little bit of short in terms of crude prices and all at least it manages to keep itself in a profitable territory. So petchem, 50-60 percent of the benefit of the capex will come in the next 12 months and the rest is for FY19.  So if you were to start looking at it from a two-year perspective, the catch up that Reliance has started with 30-35 percent upside we have seen in the last couple of months is probably just the beginning of a very strong bull run. It will start getting the Jio numbers. 1,80,000 crore is not a mean number to spend on and recover but why is that profitability starts improving incrementally every day, every month, I think we are giving it a little bit of a sceptical rating and P/E multiple at this current level.  My rough calculation tells me that the price on a core business itself should be above Rs 1,550, the Jio business right now is free now. Some people say it is a loss-making thing, so that is why we are not discounting it positively but if you were to take that on the basis of a rough discounted cash flow (DCF), I think this stock could be Rs 2,000 probably in the next 12-15 months itself.  Latha: Is there more to buy in HDFC Bank and do you see collateral advantage in any other stocks?  A: This is like when you start running out of good opportunities, whatever comes your way and you want to put the bucket out as Warren Buffet keeps on saying but to be honest, there is so much available in that NBFC and banking space and I think the PSU banks are still &ndash; the bigger ones, let us not get into this whole long list of midcaps, smallcap banks in the PSU side - definitely offer much more upside in terms of the re-rating that is underway.  HDFC Bank is a comeback that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have made and that is one of the reasons why you have seen that overzealous buying that has happened. On the fundamentals, a lot of other banks have started delivering incrementally much better value. So I would not read too much into the mood that is changed towards HDFC Bank suddenly.  I would look at some of the other banks and not to say that some of the other banks haven&rsquo;t done well as well. They have also been amply rewarded whether it is IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, RBL. Look at small, big, everything is getting amply rewarded. So in that liberal mood that we are in, there could be some better opportunities as well.  Sonia: Lately we are seeing a lot of companies that have an exposure to Maruti Suzuki that are doing very well, the auto ancillaries, whether it is Jay Bharat Maruti, Lumax Industries, Subros etc, the rally has been thick and fast but any stocks where there is still value?  A: Let us look at some of the smaller ones and they might not necessarily be Maruti oriented in terms of their growth so we talked about the Shivam Autotech casually once.  However, what is changing there and I think the quarterly numbers will probably capture that is that they have set up a pilot with Bosch &ndash; one is they have got the Rohtak unit already commissioned, Bosch unit if that takes off, they could probably be one of the very few global auto ancillary plays where Bosch has given out that technology and wants to depend on it.  Now given the globalisation that is happening, Indian automobile ancillary units supplying to some of the OEMs across the world will benefit much more because this is one space where China does not compete much, the Latin American markets have slowed down quite a bit, Europe is not competing as much, I would still look at some of the quasi global plays in this and I keep on talking about the likes of the Endurance Tech and Motherson Sumi. So you stick to those, not necessarily just the domestic ones.

For the consolidated numbers for the fourth quarter of FY17 &ndash; the 45 percent growth in revenue was driven by 50 percent and 26 percent growth in refining and petrochemicals respectively; whereas organised retail also posted a strong show, growing by 83 percent. Despite a tad subdued margin performance, substantial savings in interest expenses drove the 12 percent growth in profit.    Segmental Highlights  For the key segment of refining - the Gross Refining Margin (GRM) stood at USD 11.5 per barrel against USD 10.8 per barrel in the previous quarter. RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by USD 5.1 per barrel. The lower sequential margin was on account of lower gasoline and naphtha cracks.  For the petrochemicals segment, the strong topline growth was aided by an increase in prices across all products, which was partially offset by lower volumes. The stable margin performance was supported by product prices.  Oil and gas continued with a subdued performance. The decline in revenue was led by lower upstream production and lower domestic gas price realisation. Volumes were lower on account of a slowdown in development activity and natural decline. Consequently, the segment margin was negative.  Retail posted a stellar show &ndash; quarterly revenue crossing the 10,000 mark. The increase in turnover was led by growth across all consumption baskets. The margin performance was also stable. Reliance Retail added 63 stores across various store concepts. At the end of the year, it operated 3,616 stores across 702 cities with an area of over 13.5 million square feet.    The Growth Drivers  The update on Jio was a key takeaway of the earnings. Jio had 108.9 million subscribers on the network. While it isn&rsquo;t revenue accretive at the moment, the key factor to watch out for in Jio is the capacity that&rsquo;s in place. Jio has the world&rsquo;s largest greenfield 4G LTE wireless broadband network, with over 100,000 mobile towers, and will add another 100,000 towers to the network in the coming months.  The business hasn&rsquo;t yet started meaningful revenue contribution as it launched with a nominal, one-time enrolment fee of Rs 99. It has been followed up with Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan - at Rs 309 for three months and an unlimited plan at Rs 509 for high data users. However, any future tariff plan will only add to revenue and help achieve break-even of this business.  Reliance Industries had embarked upon USD 20 billion core capex which is seeing fruition. One of the major core projects, based on the USD 1.5bn ethane imports from the US - has been commissioned. The highly competitive ethane imports will replace the existing expensive propane feedstock to RIL&rsquo;s crackers, would result in meaningful savings.  The company also updated that it has&nbsp;commenced commercial production from its Coal Bed Methane (CBM). The production from RIL&rsquo;s Sohagpur CBM fields will gradually ramp-up in the next 15-18 months making RIL among the largest unconventional natural gas producers in India.  RIL also mentioned installation of Para-Xylene, Cracker and downstream projects (MEG, Linear Low density and Low density Polyethylene) as well as Gasification.  The traction in telecom revenue and the commissioning of the core projects will be the key drivers of incremental performance going forward. These fundamental drivers alongside a decent valuation of 12.8X FY18 price to earnings lends substantial margin of safety for investors.

Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 10.8 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 46,194 crore ($ 7.1 billion) from Rs 41,704 crore in the previous year.  &amp;quot;Refining and petrochemicals businesses achieved record levels of profitability, underpinned by our ability to access feedstock competitively from global markets, maintain high operating rates and place products in growth markets,&amp;quot; Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said.  &amp;quot;With ongoing projects our portfolio will become significantly more robust and integrated, securing long-term profitable growth,&amp;quot; he said.

Dividend  The Board of Directors has recommended a dividend of Rs 11 per fully paid up Equity share of Rs 10/- each for the financial year 2016-17, aggregating Rs 3,916 crore ($ 604 million), including dividend distribution tax.  Petrochemical Business  Q4 FY17 revenue from the Petrochemicals segment increased by 26.4 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 26,478 crore (USD 4.1 billion), primarily due to increase in prices across all products, this was partially offset by lower volumes. Petrochemicals segment EBIT increased by 25.8 percent to Rs3,441 crore (USD 531 million), supported by favorable product deltas, RIL said in a statement.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas Business  For the quarter ended March 31, revenues for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment decreased by 19.9 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 1,309 crore. Continuing weak price environment in the domestic market and declining production trend impacted segment revenues.  Segment EBIT was at (486) crore, as against (153) crore in the corresponding period of the previous year, said the RIL statement.  Organised Retail  Q4 FY17 revenues grew by 83 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to Rs 10,332 crore, a milestone level for quarterly revenues. The increase in turnover was led by growth across all consumption baskets. The business PBDIT grew by 65.6 percent to Rs 366 crore in FY17 as against Rs 221 crore in the previous year.  During the quarter, Reliance Retail added 63 stores across various store concepts.

Condensate production in Q4 FY17 was at 0.06 MMBBL.  Fall in oil and gas production was mainly on account of natural decline in the fields coupled with water and sand ingress. The 2nd Side track well in MA field was completed and was put into production. Currently, eight&nbsp;wells in D1D3 and 4 wells in MA are producing. Efforts are on to keep the wells flowing until production from new projects come on stream.  Shale Gas performance improves  The Shale Gas business performance improved sequentially on the back of improving prices and higher volumes. Unit realization improved by 18 percent on a Q-o-Q basis and revenue grew by 20 percent while EBITDA improved by 25 percent on a sequential basis.  However, full year performance remained impacted by lower volumes and also weak prices in the previous quarters.

Fag Bearing&nbsp;-- the 51 percent subsidiary of Germany-based Schaeffler Group -- also reported decent earnings on the back of margin improvement. The Indian subsidiary is the second-largest player in the bearings market with 15 percent market share. It is well-diversified across segments and is the market leader in the passenger vehicle segment. The industry is at an inflection point, and for risk-averse investors a stock like Fag offers mid teen earnings growth story.  International Travel House, an associate company of ITC Limited and which offers a full bouquet of travel services, also reported a performance worth taking note of. Despite a modest topline growth, significant improvement in operating margin aided a significant surge in profit.  The run-up in the past one year has been modest and the valuation looks reasonable seen in the context of the financial performance of The Tinplate Company of India (TCIL), a subsidiary of Tata Steel. The company&nbsp;is a producer of tin coated and tin free sheets. It&nbsp;manufactures various grades of electrolytic tinplates, tin-free steel sheets and full hard cold rolled sheets (FHCR) used for metal packaging.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Anuj: What are your thoughts on Reliance Industries Ltd? That is going to be important stock for the market, do you think it has legs to move from here or do you think it has rallied a lot so there could be some profit taking?  A: Reliance just tend to spring a surprise from time to time and this time expectations are high that not only the core business but there would be more input as regards the telecom venture and some visibility of earnings or breakeven over there which is what analysts are looking forward to.  So I would be optimistic on the numbers of the company and it is just around the corner so better to wait and watch, hear what the management has to say, see what the guidance is, what the visibility is going forward and any other future plans or at least status of expansion also will be known at that point of time and then make perhaps a trading or an investment call but by and large, on a long-term basis, we are not that optimistic or positive on Reliance and we do feel that Reliance Jio may take a little longer to breakeven and start delivering in terms of return on capital employed and what the street and analysts have factored in to their assumptions and their earnings model.  Latha: So it should stabilise at current levels you think, Rs 1,400?  A: I will just wait and watch. Let the numbers come out and see what the management has to say and then make a more informed call. Buying just prior to results is not that great strategy from a trading or investment perspective.  Latha: Buying after results, HDFC Bank, has more to run?  A: HDFC Bank came out with a good set of numbers and although the non-performing assets (NPAs) have been moving up, they are still well under control given the size of the balance sheet and the kind of regular requirements, which are there and it remains a secular consistent performer and I would say that it should be part of every portfolio, at least part of the core holdings. So maybe at these levels or at corrections or in a steady manner investor should look at having a decent exposure to HDFC Bank.  Having said that, it is a company which we and our clients have invested as a disclosure and on the whole I think from the earnings release as well as the conference call, it does appear that the kind of edge and the kind of outperformance, which HDFC has versus its peer group in the banking sector still remains pretty much intact and clearly impress the focus of the productivity this time around in terms of number of employees, which got reduced. So many factors going positive for HDFC Bank, qualitative as well as quantitative.  For full interview, watch accompanying video...

Data show that the stock has posted&nbsp;negative returns in the past four quarters on the day after its results. Over the past eight quarters, the stock goes into the earnings (ahead of or on the day of the earnings) with flattish performance.  &amp;quot;This quarter has been an exception where the stock broke an 8-year high on Feb 21 and marched northwards making 52-week high,&rdquo; Rohit Singre, Senior Research Analyst&nbsp; (Equity &ndash; Technical) at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol.com.  &ldquo;We expect profitability of the company for the current quarter on a consolidated basis to be flat both on sequential as well as on a yearly basis but the commentary on Jio and energy project execution will be the key,&rdquo; he said.  This time, RIL's fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be steady to strong as higher petchem profitability may drive sequential operational improvement.  Petchem segment should benefit from strong cracker margins, analysts believe. According to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, gross refining margin during the quarter is expected to be at USD 10.9 a barrel against USD 10.8 a barrel in the previous quarter.    RIL is expected to report 11.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its net profit to Rs 8,081.5 crore for the quarter ended March 31, compared to Rs 7,227&nbsp;crore reported in the year-ago period, IDFC Capital said in a report.  The net sales are likely to rise by 30.9 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 653,723 crore for the quarter ended March 31, compared to Rs 499,570 crore reported in the year-ago period.  After the 2008 crash, RIL stock performance was muted for nearly eight successive years.  This heavyweight counter broke out of a massive consolidation phase finally on February 21, when the stock moved out of the long multi-year congestion zone to confirm a strong technical breakout.  The price development was accompanied by humongous volumes; indicating tremendous buying interests, said experts.  The stock has been a standout performer on D-Street so far in the year 2017. It has already rallied nearly 30 percent so far in the year and is close to reclaiming the tag of &lsquo;King of D-Street&rsquo; -- the company with highest market capitalisation on the BSE.  &ldquo;There has been no stopping for this stock as the prices hastened beyond the 1400 mark in no time to give 30 percent returns.&nbsp; Hence, as far as direction is concerned, it remains strongly up and the higher degree chart structure looks extremely sturdy,&rdquo; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst Technical, and Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd told Moneycontrol.com.  &ldquo;If we consider past four quarterly results day, the stock prices have been trading with a slightly negative bias post results on three out four occasions. However, we do not expect the history to repeat itself if we consider the recent price and volume activity in the counter,&rdquo; he said.  We have collated a list of views on how to trade RIL ahead of Q4 results:  Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist &ndash; Technical Research &amp;amp;amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in  Since the last three weeks, this counter is consolidating with an &lsquo;Inside Bar&rsquo; kind of formation on the weekly charts which has a range of Rs 1337 &ndash; 1449. Considering the fact that the scrip has already rallied 30 percent in the last three months, one can safely assume that such a robust move can be in anticipation of good numbers which the market tried factored in.  Hence, there will a threat of backlash from the trading community if the expectations are not met on result day.  Therefore, we recommend investors who already own this counter to buy out of the money put with a strike price of 1360 to protect the downside risk related to result-day volatility whereas fresh buying can be considered around 1350 levels if scrip corrects.  Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst Techical and Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd.  We expect the stock to continue its northward rally to surpass the all-time high quite soon. Every meaningful dip in this stock is likely to get bought into.  Thus, traders/investors who remained on the sidelines in the recent run should pounce on to any decline towards 1350 &ndash; 1300 (if any) post the result announcement. A strong base has now been shifted towards Rs 1,235 and we do not expect the stock to go below this level in the near-term.  Foram Parekh, Research analyst (Equity &ndash; Fundamental) at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd  Talking about past behavior of the stock on result day, we haven&rsquo;t seen much moment historically. We are recommending short strangle strategy can be used to eat the premium. The strategy consists of simultaneously selling one slightly out of the money Call &amp;amp;amp; one slightly out of the money Put.  Rohit Srivastava, Fund Manager &ndash; PMS, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.  RIL has been outperforming the market since Nov however it may have completed this move and is due for a correction. This has been one of the best performing periods in years. A pull back to Rs1300 or 1234 in the coming weeks cannot be ruled out, and a move above Rs 1450 may change this opinion.  Birendrakumar Singh, AVP &ndash; Technical Research, Systematix shares and stocks  Reliance gave a multiyear breakout in February 2017. The breakout is out of the 8 years of consolidation that has formed a &ldquo;NeoWave Non Limiting Triangle&rdquo; pattern. The breakout of this 8 years of consolidation is significant, indicates a target of Rs1,735-2,002 and higher.  Short term trend is overbought and is likely to consolidate in a range of Rs1,319 and Rs1,448 levels. One should maintain existing long position, in the case of a reaction buy in a range of Rs1,340-1,319 levels.  A decisive move above Rs1,448 would indicate further breakout with an immediate target of Rs1,513. Long term target is placed at Rs1,735-2,002, time period 18 months.

The Nifty50 closed marginally lower for third consecutive week suggesting indecisiveness among bulls as well as bears.  The coming week is unlikely to be any different as D-Street await results from index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, Wipro, Kotak Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, etc. among others.  The Indian market has shown a lot of resilience this past week as it refused to go down below its crucial support level of 9,100. The index dipped below 9,100 in intraday trade in 4 out of 5 trading session but managed to close it showing a mark of strength.  Most analysts are of the view that as long as the index stays above 9,000 on a closing basis, the trend both from a short to medium-term perspective remains on the upside.  On the higher side, the index is likely to touch 9,300-9,340 in the next two or three weeks if 9000 remains intact.  We bring you list of 6 factors which are likely to chart the direction of the market this coming week:  April F&amp;amp;amp;O Expiry:  The market will remain volatile as traders roll over positions in the futures &amp;amp;amp; options (F&amp;amp;amp;O) segment from the near month April 2017 series to May 2017 series. The near month April 2017 derivatives contract expire on Thursday, 27 April 2017.  &ldquo;On the data front, open interest in Nifty futures witnessed a secular declining trend throughout the series. The current open interest is almost 20 percent lower compared to open interest seen in the March series at the same point of time,&rdquo; ICICI Securities said in a report.  &ldquo;In the options space, the 9000 Put strike remains the highest base. Downsides below these levels are not expected in the Nifty. On the higher side, fresh additions were seen at ATM 9,200 Call strike. Thus, a move above 9,200 is likely to prompt the short covering movement in the index towards settlement,&rdquo; it said.  RIL Q4 results:  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will be in focus as it declares its results for the quarter ended March 31 post market hours on Monday. RILs' fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be steady to strong as higher petchem profitability may drive sequential operational improvement.  Petchem segment should benefit from strong cracker margins, analysts believe. According to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, gross refining margin during the quarter is expected to be at USD 10.90 a barrel against USD 10.80 a barrel in the previous quarter.  Macroeconomic Data:  Market participants will also keep an eye on macroeconomic data such as Infrastructure output data, foreign reserve, bank deposit growth as well bank loan growth will be released on April 28, Friday.  India's annual infrastructure output growth slowed to 1.0 percent in February, the lowest level in at least 13 months, government data showed on Friday. Overall output grew an annual 3.4 percent in the previous month.  French Elections:  Security concerns took center stage on Friday after shooting in Paris killed one policeman ahead of the polls. Voters will cast ballots in the first round on Sunday of what has turned into the most unpredictable French election. The two candidates who get the most votes will then face off in a run-off election on May 7.  &ldquo;In the coming week, the focus will be on France, where voters are heading to the polls Sunday to choose their next president. France is the second-largest economy in the euro-zone and one of the seven biggest across the world,&rdquo; Vijay Singhania, Founder-Director, Trade Smart Online told Moneycontrol.com.  &ldquo;With the run-off of elections scheduled for May 7, it is expected that a new President will be formally confirmed by May 11. France uses the two-round voting system where a leader can be elected this Sunday if they win an outright majority but the polls suggest that this is unlikely, a run-off between the two leading candidates is expected and is scheduled for May 7,&rdquo; he said.  Nearly 100 companies to report Q4 results:  Nearly 100 companies will report their results for the quarter ended March 31 this coming week which include index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, Wipro, Kotak Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, etc. among others.  Other companies which will report results for Q4 include names like Indiabulls Housing Finance, UltraTech Cements, Can Fin Homes, IDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Persistent Systems, KPIT Technologies, KSB Pumps, Tata Sponge, Biocon, Indiabulls Real Estate, Syngene International, Tata Elxsi, Ambuja Cements, CEAT, Aditya Birla Money etc. among others.  Technical Outlook:  As per moving averages, the Nifty50 index is still above its short term moving averages and that is the where it is finding a lot of support around 9,050 levels. The resistance is still around 9,220 &ndash; 9,230 where analysts&rsquo; are seeing a distribution pattern emerging.  &ldquo;Going into next week, a range breaks out may further decide the trend though the bullish is bias may continue and any decline towards short term averages may see higher volumes and initial buying set up,&rdquo; Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research told Moneycontrol.com.  &ldquo;A possible downside can be of marginal 1 percent with support at 9,000 and resistance at 9,300 in the coming week. Below 9,000 we may see a slide to 8,850 &ndash; 8,900,&rdquo; he said.  Nadeem further added that as per candlestick reading, indecisiveness is seen on charts with candle patterns showing a small body indicating a range may be seen in the continuation or a breakout may be near."

RIL, however, did not give the current production level. It is targeting 3.5 million standard cubic meters per day of peak output from two adjacent CBM blocks in Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. CBM is an environment-friendly natural gas extracted from coal-bed and has become an important source of unconventional gas in many parts of the world.

The research firm believes that while the company missed revenue marginally due to a drag in BFSI and retail, other verticals such as telecom, manufacturing and life sciences surprised positively. It sees growth accelerating from the first or the second quarter of this fiscal.  Analysts at the firm observed that the constant currency margin was intact due to ramp ups in Dilligenta projects and may aid margin in FY18. As such, it sees shaved margins by 60 basis points in FY18 but still expects expansion in FY18-19. It has cut earnings by 2 percent. Furthermore, the capital allocation policy announced by TCS lacks detail, it added.  Macquarie has maintained a neutral stance on the stock with a lower target of Rs 2,274. It has lowered FY18-19 estimated earnings per share by 3-5 percent. A pick up in US BFSI, large deal win are the key likely catalysts for the stock.  Deutsche Bank reiterated top buy status on the stock with a target at Rs 2,900. It expects the firm to deliver constant currency revenue guidance of 9.4 percent year on year in FY18. Furthermore, it has also cut earnings estimates by 4-5 percent given the margin miss in Q4. It expect the company to deliver EPS Of Rs 145.7 in FY18 &amp;amp;amp; earnings CAGR of 12% in FY18-20  JPMorgan has a neutral call on the stock with a target of Rs 2,450. The research firm observed that FY17&rsquo;s robustly free cash flow/PAT conversion ratio implies 75-80 percent PAT paid out as dividends.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch has retained an underperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,130. It believes that TCS&rsquo; Q4 revenue growth and EBIT margin were below consensus and expectations. It expects a decline in EBIT margin as rupee appreciation is also weighing on it.  Citi has a sell call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,140 from Rs 2,195. The company&rsquo;s Q4 results are largely in line with estimates and the margin band of 26-28 percent looks difficult considering FY17 miss. The lower than consensus expectation remains unchanged, it added. Furthermore, valuation at over 17 times FY18e is difficult to justify given the slowing growth.  IDFC securities has reiterated its neutral rating on the stock with a cut in target price to Rs 2,325. The soft performance in Q4 is largely on account of weaker BFSI and retail growth. It believes that the drag from larger vertical would restrict revenue growth to 6 percent. Appreciation in rupee and investment to mitigate visa risk will erode earnings further, it added.  The brokerage house was factoring in mid-single digit earnings CAGR over FY17-19  The management&rsquo;s outlook for BFSI is stronger for FY18, but optimism is not translated in deal wins, it added. Furthermore, it is factoring in slight erosion in operating margin, but sees downside risk if the rupee held on to its level.  Jefferies has maintained its buy call on the stock with a reduced target to Rs 2,590. It projected dollar revenue growth of 8.7/10 percent in FY18/19 with margin below 26-28 percent range. A more constructive outlook for FY18 and robust execution are key positives.  ICICI Securities retained add call on the stock due to the management commentary on strong pipeline and deal momentum. The target price for the stock is at Rs 2,415. It expects growth at higher end of peer averages on an organic basis in FY18. But it also sees difficulty in sustaining margin in FY18 even at lower end of targeted range.  Goldman Sachs has maintained its neutral rating with a cut in target price to Rs 2,092. The earnings in Q4 were below expectations and BFSI growth remained elusive, the research firm observed. A pick up in BFSI and strong digital practice should lead to 8.3 percent CC growth in FY18.  Coal India  Citi has a buy call on the stock with a cut in target price to Rs 325 from Rs 375. It sees a fair bit of negative news flow to be priced in.  VST Industries  ICICI Securities has downgraded the stock to add from buy, but increased target to Rs 3,249 from Rs 2,713. The brokerage remains positive but the 40 percent rally in the past four months is compelling it to downgrade the stock.  Reliance Industries  JPMorgan has a neutral call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,240. The brokerage house expects another strong quarter, driven by a strong refining margin. It expects standalone PAT at RS 8,180 crore and EBITDA should be up 6 percent quarter on quarter. Furthermore, on Jio, it maintained the view that it would turn profit positive only in 2021.

Through the April 13 notification, the oil ministry said a coal bed methane (CBM) producer has to call for open bids for sale of coal gas and seek price quotes to discover the market price.  The producer will have to issue advertisement in national dailies and run a competitive bidding to arrive at the arm's-length sale price, it said.  The process prescribed is the same as the one Reliance Industries had run in 2012 to discover a price for CBM gas it is to produce in Madhya Pradesh. It had sought bids for 3.5 million standard cubic metres per day of coal gas from its Sohagpur CBM block in Madhya Pradesh at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.  At USD 100 per barrel oil price prevalent that year, CBM from RIL's Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. At USD 55 a barrel rate currently, it would cost USD 7.2. That formula was, however, rejected by the ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.  &amp;quot;In the event of market-discovered price being less than the price notified by the Petroleum Planning Analysis Cell (PPAC) under the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014, the royalty and production level payment (PLP) shall be paid on the basis of the latter,&amp;quot; the CBM pricing policy notified last week said. The PPAC notified price of gas for April 1 to September 30 at USD 2.48 per mmBtu and the same for difficult areas is USD 5.56 per mmBtu, lower than the rate in RIL formula.  &amp;quot;Sale of CBM to any affiliate of the contractor is permitted, in the event the contractor cannot identify any buyer following the procedure (of open bidding),&amp;quot; the policy said, adding that the reasons for sale to affiliates will have to be notified to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).  The policy is expected to incentivise the CBM operation in the country to boost gas production.  Of the 33 CBM-bearing blocks awarded so far in four auction rounds and on a nomination basis, gas is being produced from only four.  The four CBM blocks in production have a combined output of 1.17 million standard cubic metres per day. As many as 18 blocks have either been relinquished or are in the process as operators found that it did not make economic sense to produce gas at the prevailing rates.  According to the DGH, India has the fifth largest proven coal reserves in the world and holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. The estimated CBM resources in the country are about 92 trillion cubic feet.  The 33 CBM blocks awarded so far hold a total of 62.4 tcf of the estimated resources, of which so far, 9.9 tcf has been established as Gas in Place (GIP).  The pricing freedom will help quickly ramp up CBM gas production to targeted 5.77 mmscmd within a year, officials said.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Anuj: The stock that is leading the market is Reliance Industries. You track it of course, but do you think the risk reward is still favorable or would you advise profit taking here?  A: I think Reliance should be seen as an opportunity for next two to three years from now onwards. Probably if the market has risen I think for last three to four months, maybe I think of around 3-40 percent rally has come in the stock price, I would think that it is largely attributed to the capacity that they have expanded in their core businesses both in petrochemical polymer as well as into refining business.  So, on one side, they are going to have the volume led growth coming in because of this expansion in capacity, and other side they would have the advantage in the refining margin per se. So, that is basically attributed to the current rally in the price. I would still think that Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail, both these units within the company, I think they hold significant amount of some of the part valuation; maybe in my viewpoint somewhere around Rs 800 per share kind of a valuation between two of them is still not fully reflected into the price.  So, if the price improves to that level, maybe one could say that yes they are now finding its value into the price of Reliance. Otherwise, I would think that upside is still there. Maybe two years down the line I think we should be seeing the stock giving a handsome return from current price level itself.  Sonia: The other stocks that have been hitting new highs from the heavyweights are names like Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;amp;amp;T), State Bank of India (SBI), etc. What else from the heavyweights do you like now?  A: In fact I think these two stocks which you mentioned, between the two of them, definitely SBI looks more convincing at this point of time. Given the kind of a merger that they have done, given the size of the balance sheet that they are having now with the merged units coming up, and also the fact that the non-performing assets (NPAs) is gradually coming down. That is giving me larger amount of comfort.  On the contrary, I am waiting for the NPA finding its monetisation through the securitised receipt kind of an instrument which will come up eventually in the market now that the finance bill is passed. I would think that these are some of the positives for banks like SBI and fortunately the stock is available at valuation which has definitely corrected significantly.  So, to an extent, I would think that the margin of safety is remaining higher in this particular stock. Maybe I think one could have a 25-30 percent kind of an upside target over next 15-18 months&rsquo; time in this particular stock.  Sonia: A quick word on Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart), everyone says it looks quite expensive at Rs 660, but for somebody who is perhaps still not invested in it, would you advise it or stay away?  A: The fact is that I think the stock is having relatively less amount of liquidity post listing. I think that is possibly driving the premium valuation. Leave that aside for a while, I think the more important aspect is the fundamentals of the business. The fundamentals of the business basically I think is suggesting that the company is easily expected to grow between 25-30 percent on an organic basis at least I think for next three years as far as the visibility goes.  Given that kind of situation, given the kind of supply chain cost benefit that they are enjoying in the product vertical particularly in the food grains, I guess I think the company could possibly register reasonably smart move going forward as far as the profit outlook is concerned. With the interest cost coming down, I think it is going to be all the more beneficial for the company to register better profits. So, given that kind of a scenario, I am not having doubt in my mind about the growth in the profit that the company could register.  However, the question remains on the premium valuation. In my viewpoint, some amount of time correction is justified in this particular stock and then probably I think an investor could think of buying the stock with a view of at least two years from now.

A report in the The Economic Times&nbsp;says oil marketing companies are mulling whether to start revising petrol and diesel on a daily basis in sync with international prices.  The rationale behind the move? A shift to daily revision would mean that prices don't drop or rise sharply, as prices may only change by a few paise everyday and will not lead to a price&nbsp;shock&nbsp;for customers. It may also help the government avoid any political backlash as incremental price changes may go mostly unnoticed.  Daily revision of fuel rates is common in various advanced markets. In India, the current trend is to change fuel rates every fortnight.  According to one of the state-run oil firms, there have been talks of a daily price change for very long, but the technology has only now been made available to them.  Earlier, revision of fuel prices would mean companies making phone calls or sending out faxes, but now with various digital means, oil companies can centrally changes prices from one location of all petrol pumps.  &amp;quot;Daily price revision is about introducing international standards in the Indian fuel retail market. It helps both customers as well as dealers in managing their purchases,&amp;quot; an executive of an oil firm told the ET.  India lifted control of petrol prices in 2014 and diesel in 2010, leaving them to be governed by market prices.  The government has also encouraging private participation in the sector, with Reliance Industries, Essar&nbsp;Oil and Shell all having plans to ramp up their currently-small presence in the Indian fuel retail market.  Between them, Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL control 95 percent of the market."

Moody's calculation shows that Jio will be able to generate revenue of about Rs 213 billion (Rs 21,300 crore) for the current financial year, assuming all 72 million users pay Rs 303 per 28 days between July 2017 and March 2018.  On the enrolment of paid subscribers, Moody's Investors Service said, &amp;quot;This is credit positive as the subscriber enrolment reduces cash flow uncertainty of the telecom business, on which RIL has spent over Rs 1.7 trillion (Rs 1,70,000 crore) over the last six years.&amp;quot;  Jio, in February, said it has enrolled 100 million users for its free services that was slated to end on March 31. The company had also announced that it would start charging for services from April 1 and introduced Jio-Prime membership, a discounted set of price plans to incentivise non-paying subscribers to subscribe to paid services.  It has now extended by a fortnight the deadline for enrolment to its Jio-Prime plan, and as per its last update has 72 million paid customers. Also, it has announced that all Prime members who subscribe to higher value plans (Rs 303 and above) will enjoy complimentary services for three months and that subscribers will only be charged for services from July.  &amp;quot;... there was uncertainty about the success rate of transitioning non-paying subscribers to paid plans, but that uncertainty has now reduced to a large extent,&amp;quot; the statement by Moody's said.  It further said a significant portion of the 72 million subscribers are expected to opt for Rs 303 plan, given that it is the minimum plan that gives complimentary services for three months.  &amp;quot;However, as the price plan does not require the subscriber to commit beyond the 28 days, they are free to switch at any time after that,&amp;quot; it said, adding that Prime membership will therefore have to continue to be competitive and maintain service quality to retain customers.  The company may have to revisit its price plans beyond April 15 to attract and retain subscribers who do not sign up for the Prime offering, it noted.  Even if Jio were to generate about Rs 200 billion (Rs 20,000 crore) in revenue, it will not be sufficient to generate free cash flows as the company's spending on capex will be significantly higher than its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), Moody's said.  Hence, despite a large paying subscriber base, Moody's said, &amp;quot;We continue to expect that Jio will remain a drag on RIL's cash flows for at least the next 2-3 years.&amp;quot;  Jio's aggressive stance will ensure a heightened state of competition in the sector for the foreseeable future, it added.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Sonia: The stock that could be on the rise today is Reliance Industries because of the announcement that they made of 72 million subscribers that have availed the Jio Prime Membership. This stock has been on a tear, but do you see a lot more upside from the current level?  A: It is probably one of the largest capex ever undertaken in India, maybe in the entire Asia-Pacific region. So, we have to just wait and see how it pans out on the earnings front. 72 million while it looks big for an industry upstart entrant, it may not sound that much of a music for somebody trying to extrapolate into earnings stream.  So, I guess we have to wait and watch for some time. However, nonetheless 72 million is decent percentage of Indian population and that is about it.  Latha: Are you positive on the stock itself, I mean it has seen a fairly decent run up, after all the index is looking for support from various sectors, will Reliance be one of them?  A: I would not want to pass a specific comment on any stock, but, yes, when a largecap stock generally morphs, of this size, something undertakes such a huge morphing of its entire business model, I guess it is just generally a long-term pain and long-term pain seems to be drawing to an end for this company.  So, yes, you could expect something, maybe a light at the end of the tunnel. As I mentioned, it is probably one of the largest capex ever undertaken and if this calculated gamble works out, you could be in for good times.  Sonia: The other thing that stands out in the data over the weekend is the way the tractor sales have done really well whether it is for Mahindra and Mahindra (M&amp;amp;amp;M) or even for a company like Escorts that just announced its numbers. These stocks have seen a goodish bit of an up move, but do you still see a lot of value in this space?  A: I think tractor sales, I don&rsquo;t know I may be in minority, but we may have jumped the guns out there because generally it has to be a post-harvest phenomena and we are seeing it in a pre-monsoon phenomena which may not be justifiable at the current levels. So, I guess we may have, the entire market may have jumped -- I am not saying the stock market, but the tractor market may have jumped the gun.  They may have been some pre-emptive buying out there, but for stock market, yes, it may be sensible or prudent to take some money off the table at the current level because I think the monsoon and the portents which are coming, may not be that good.

The research firm sees a disruption due to the Supreme Court order that banned liquor shops on highways. Even if states choose to circumvent the ban, the company may still see demand destruction, it added. The ban will now shift demand to shops further away from highways.  The key risk to the stock could be monetization of non-core assets and a further buyback by Diageo.  On the financials front, analysts at the firm have cut FY19 earnings per share estimates by 6.5 percent and value the stock using 12-month forward PE target multiple of 50 times.  CLSA has recommended a sell call with a reduced target price to Rs 1,600 from Rs 2,100 as profitability could be long going ahead. It has cut FY17-19 EPS by 17-28 percent, but also expects states to support the industry during the transition which will still take time. The key upside risk to the stock could be the hope of a tender offer from Diageo.  Morgan Stanley is overweight on United Spirits with a target price of Rs 2,900. It foresees 42 percent of the country&rsquo;s liquor sales facing dislocation due to the ban. Furthermore, it sees a near-term impact on the firm&rsquo;s volumes as the business gets aligned to the new rules.  IIFL has an add rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,250. The brokerage house sees muted growth to FY18 on the back of the apex court&rsquo;s verdict as well as implementation of GST. The ban will weigh on the company&rsquo;s Q4 alcohol sales as well.  Further, demonetisation impact will continue to be visible, but at a lower level than Q3. It sees the firm&rsquo;s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation growing 15 percent and hence sees 14 percent decline in EPS in Q4.  Kotak Institutional Equities expects the SC verdict&rsquo;s impact to be material but transitionary in nature till shops relocate. It sees the decision hitting liquor firms as 35-40 percent liquor outlets are located along the highways. This relocation will drive de-stocking in the near term which can impact Q1 volume.  Reliance Industries  JPMorgan is neutral on the stock with a target of Rs 1,240. The research firm sees Reliance&rsquo;s decision to extend Jio Prime deadline as a step to add more subscribers and believes that the firm&rsquo;s telecom journey has just begun. The sign-ups are a positive, but extension and more freebies are puzzling, it says.  Furthermore, it sees net debt to continue to rise and the final capex figure is yet to be seen. Jio would need revenues of USD 400-500 billion to be PBT positive and forecasts EBITDA of USD 221 billion in FY21 and USD 287 billion in FY22.

Along with the extension of the deadline, Jio continued with its streak of throwing surprises when it unveiled its latest offer known as &lsquo;Summer Surprise&rsquo;. Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries', promises this to be just the first of many surprises lined up for Jio Prime members.  Ambani in his statement said more than 72 million Jio customers have signed up for Jio Prime so far and the number is only supposed to go up further.  Here&rsquo;s a brief of what the plans are and how Prime members stand to benefit.  Extension of enrolment for Prime:  Jio&rsquo;s free service period is coming to an end. Jio Users as customers can enrol for Jio Prime offer by paying just Rs 99 and opting for a plan of Rs 303 or above.  &lsquo;Summer Surprise&rsquo; offer  All those who enrol before April 15 and recharge for plans of Rs 303 and more will get three months of complimentary service i.e. the company will not charge you anything till July 1, 2017 and one can continue availing benefits of its existing plan.  For example, if a user recharges with Rs 99 (enrolment into Jio Prime) and then recharges worth Rs 303, before April 15 he can avail 1GB data per day along with unlimited free calling services and SMS service.  Now instead of Rs 303, if somebody recharges worth Rs 499 he will receive 2GB data every day for free till July 1, 2017.  What will happen if you don&rsquo;t enrol for Prime by April 15?  If one fails to recharge by April 15, all the free services from Jio will come to an end. Furthermore, Jio Prime members enjoy almost double data benefits when compared to non-Jio Prime members.  According to Reliance, users who do not recharge by April 15 will experience degradation and/or discontinuation of services.  What to do if the Rs 303-data plan with 1 GB daily FUP is not enough?  If 1GB free data daily on 4G speeds is not good enough you can opt for the Rs 499 Jio Prime plan which offers a daily FUP on 4G speeds of 2GB for 28 days. To get rid of the FUP altogether, users can opt for the Rs 999 Jio Prime Plan, which offers 60GB 4G data with 60 days validity without any FUP.  There are other plans for Rs 1,999, Rs 4,999 and Rs 9,999 with 90 days, 180 days and 360 days validity and 125GB, 350GB, and 750GB data respectively without any FUP.  In case, you are using a Jio Prime plan without FUP and run out of data midway, you can always opt for booster packs ranging between Rs 11 and Rs 301 with 0.1GB to 10GB data.

The telecom company also extended its Jio Prime subscription enrollment till April 15.  Dubbing it as Jio's Summer Surprise to users who have agreed to pay for its 4G services, the company extended&nbsp;the offer as a token of appreciation to the 72 million subscribers who signed up for its Prime membership service.  This is the largest transition ever from a free service to a paid one, the company said explaining the reason for extending the Jio Prime membership offer till April 15.  All subscribers who recharge with Rs 303 in April will get services free till July, Ambani announced on Friday.  In a letter to customers, Ambani said: &amp;quot;I am committed to walking the extra mile for my Jio family members. We have heard your voice and are extending this deadline for purchasing Jio's Rs 303 and other plans till April 15. This extension will provide the necessary breathing room for users to avoid service disruption during transition from free to paid services.&rdquo;  Jio is the only operator to offer 1 GB of 4G data to subscribers with no hidden clauses unlike many other operators who are giving it for a limited period of 3 months to post-paid customers.  Users who do not pay for Jio's services will see degradation and discontinuation of services from April 15. In February, Jio had announced that it would offer data at special prices to its 100 million subscribers if they paid Rs 99 to become Jio Prime members.  Reliance Jio announced on Friday that 72 million subscribers on its network had signed up for the Prime Membership.&nbsp;Besides, Jio now has the largest 4G subscriber base in the country with more 4G subscribers than incumbents such as Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone India.  If subscribers pay Rs 303 per month for an year, the company would have collected Rs 720 crore in fees and will clock in revenues of Rs 24,000 crore in FY18, analysts said. Shares of Reliance Industries ended the day at Rs 1,319, the highest since 2008.  In a related development, the Advertising Standards Council on Friday asked Airtel to remove or modify its advertisements that claim it is the fastest network operator in India. The fast-track committee on Friday ruled in favour of Jio stating that the ads were misleading. According to reports, Airtel plans to contest the ruling of the ASCI and plans to file an appeal.

The panel, headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Prof Lawrence Boo, had its first hearing on March 3 where the timetable was drawn, sources privy to the development said. RIL will first file its statement of claim, followed by a statement of defence by the government.  This will be followed by rejoinders, counter-rejoinders and oral hearing, sources said, adding that the panel plans to wind up the hearing in a year. The central government has named former Supreme Court judge GS Singhvi as its nominee on the three-member arbitration panel while RIL and its partners BP Plc of the UK and Canada's Niko Resources have named former UK High Court Judge Bernard Eder to the panel. RIL-BP-Niko had slapped an arbitration notice on November 11 last year.  This was against the oil ministry's November 3, 2016 notice to RIL, Niko and UK's BP seeking USD 1.47 billion for producing about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas in the seven years ended March 31, 2016 that had seeped or migrated from the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal.  After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources.  The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee. The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016, report, concluded that there has been &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML.  The government, sources said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from RIL-BP-Niko for &amp;quot;the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained&amp;quot;. So, a notice was sent, they said, adding that the government is also pressing RIL to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than the target.  The cost recovery issue is being arbitrated separately. Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL. Under direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah, however, said the compensation should go to the government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.

Below is the verbatim transcript of Deven Choksey's interview to Latha Venkatesh, Sonia Shenoy &amp;amp;amp; Anuj Singhal.  Latha: The goods and services tax (GST) council has finished its meet and we have a reasonable promise that final tax along with the cess on cigarettes and on luxury cars will not be more than what the consumers are currently paying. Will you go by that or is there a worry that because there is an enabling provision at some later date, the taxes could be more?  A: As it comes out and as we call it as a sin tax, it is capped at 15 percent for the time being which according to me could be a good amount of breather/steady environment provider at this point of time for most of the companies without disrupting the existing set of the business etc, so that could be seen in the near future, at least some amount of stability factor as far as this particular tax goes and its impact on different companies and the consumers thereon.  However, from long-term perspective I do not know whether the enabling provision would be exercising the near future or maybe it would take longer time for exercising the rates which are more than the capped rates of around 15 percent at this point of time.  Latha: So you buy ITC?  A: ITC looks promising for sure, leave aside this particular move, the stock looks promising because of all the business verticals in which they are operating, each of them are showing distinct signs of growth and promises for better profit performance going forward. So certainly ITC remains a good pick within the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) space.  Anuj: How would you approach Reliance Industries at current levels?  A: Fundamentally the stock remains quite comfortable having seen the expansion in the capacity in the petrochemical polymer segment, having seen the expansion in the capacity in the refining segment and the output probably would start contributing in FY17-18 along with lower cost of feed stock. The core business itself is expected to produce performance which is almost going to be 1/3rd more than what the company has been producing at this point of time, so maybe in 12-15 months time you should be seeing the full capacity of expanded volumes which would come into play from the core business itself.  However, the Jio business is having a valuation close to Rs 550-600 on sum-of-the-parts valuation basis which could reflect another Rs 400-500 jump into the stock price going forward. The retail business given the D-Mart's valuation I would assume and start giving the valuation perspective into Reliance, its combined stock from sum-of-the-parts perspective. So overall I am comfortable. The stock remains potential target price for Rs 1,600-1,800 levels going forward.

The research firm also forecasts cigarette earnings before interest and taxes growth to return to double digits in case of stable taxation in the GST Bill. Morgan Stanley is overweight on ITC with a target price of Rs 310 per share. It sees stock trending closer to this target. It says the proposed specific cess on cigarettes 6 percent lower than the current tax rate. This reduction will be offset by an increase in GST rate to 28 percent against the VAT rate of 25 percent. On taxation, it feels that the probability of excise tax being imposed on cigarettes in the first year is low. Against that, it feels that the probability of tobacco cess being entirely specific has increased. CLSA has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 325 per share. It feels that the overall tax incidence on tobacco is likely to be neutral and considers it positive for the stock. It feels that revenue neutrality seems to be the guiding principle. Deutsche Bank has also reiterated its buy stance on the stock with a target price of Rs 325 per share. Its initial assessment on GST highlights a positive for the stock on the status quo on taxes.

Given the high internal rate of return, it feels the acquisition of 7.5 acres of land to develop a residential project is favourable and may lead to bigger investments going forward. NTPC JPMorgan is overweight on the stock with a target price at Rs 185. It expects bunching up of 2.87 GW of standalone project announcements in a month.

The move will help operators like Reliance Industries and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to quickly put into production the coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks they hold and reverse the trend of investors relinquishing coal-seam blocks due to viability issues of current pricing.  &amp;quot;The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for marketing and pricing freedom to the CBM contractors to sell the CBM at arm's length price in the domestic market,&amp;quot; an official statement said here.  To discover the arms length sales, a contractor like RIL or ONGC has to ensure a fully transparent and competitive bidding process from amongst users of the CBM gas &amp;quot;with the objective that the best possible price is realised for the gas without any restrictive commercial practices,&amp;quot; it said.  Also, the companies have been permitted to sell the CBM gas to any of their affiliates in the event they cannot identify any buyer.  &amp;quot;Royalty and other dues to the government, however, shall be payable on the basis of Petroleum Planning &amp;amp;amp; Analysis Cell (PPAC) notified prices or selling prices, whichever is higher,&amp;quot; the statement said.  The policy is expected to incentivise the CBM operation in the country to boost gas production. It &amp;quot;will generate economic activities which in turn will be beneficial for creating more employment opportunities in CBM operations and related activities,&amp;quot; it added.  Of the 33 CBM bearing blocks awarded so far in four auction rounds and on a nomination basis, gas is being produced from only four.  The move will benefit Reliance which has two blocks in Madhya Pradesh that are in the process of starting production.  ONGC and Essar Oil too will benefit from the new policy as it will help them put their acreage into production quickly.  The four CBM blocks in production have a combined output of 1.17 million standard cubic metres per day. As many as 18 blocks have either been relinquished or are in the process as operators found that it did not make economic sense to produce gas at the prevailing rates.  Most of the natural gas produced in the country is priced at average of rates prevailing in gas surplus nations like the US, Russia and Canada. The current price comes to USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit, a rate considered unviable by many operators.  According to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), India has the 5th largest proven coal reserves in the world and holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. The estimated CBM resources in the country are about 92 trillion cubic feet.  The 33 CBM blocks awarded so far hold a total of 62.4 Tcf of the estimated CBM resource, of which, so far, 9.9 Tcf has been established as Gas in Place (GIP).  The sources said the CBM gas pricing policy proposed to the Cabinet is in line with the recently unveiled regime governing small and marginal oil and natural gas blocks.  The government had recently auctioned small and marginal discovered oil and gas fields by promising investors complete pricing, marketing and production freedom under a revenue sharing contract agreement.  Pricing freedom would help quickly ramp up CBM gas production to targeted 5.77 mmscmd within a year, they said.  Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network18 media and Moneycontrol.com."

It feels current valuations priced in most of the positives. The brokerage house values company at Rs 54,000 crore (Rs 380 per share). It believes inflows in life insurance to grow at 18-20 percent CAGR between FY2016-20 and also believes ULIP inflows will be higher than that of traditional policies. Kotak sees huge potential for pure protection segment over the medium-term. Industrials Jefferies says Siemens' 39 percent outperformance over ABB in the last 2 years (January 2015-March 2017) has been driven by the sharp margin improvement from cost initiatives. ABB's CY16 margin recovery was impacted by its investment with the parent. The brokerage house has lowered company's CY17-18 EPS estimates by 6-9 percent factoring some of this to continue and revised target price to Rs 1,540 from Rs 1700 earlier. However, as margin recovery plays out into CY17-18, Jefferies believes it will bridge this outperformance gap. &amp;quot;Barring the one-off investments with the parent in its export facilities, margins would have 9-9.5 percent against reported 8.6 percent for CY16. CY17-18 is expected to see far lower investments, and hence, we believe this margin recovery surprise will play out in CY17-18 for ABB,&amp;quot; it explains. Jefferies says Siemens' margin recovery story has played out into its Q1FY17 also, and hence it believes limited surprise scope potential leaves limited room for upside. Bharti Airtel Deutsche Bank says Bharti Airtel's deal with Millicom to combine operations in Ghana reflected continued progress on African restructuring. Hence, the brokerage house assigned buy rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 400. GAIL Nomura says GAIL is its top pick in oil &amp;amp;amp; gas space and hence, maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 620. Time-swap deal with Gunvor should further ease market concerns, it believes. However, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has reiterated underperform rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 422 as it feels sluggish domestic demand is a key risk. It says Gunvor deal would be incrementally positive but concerns on selling rest of the volume could present a downside. Earnings momentum is intact, but risk/reward is unfavourable, BoAML feels. Reliance Industries Credit Suisse has neutral rating on Reliance Industries as it believes the stock is already pricing in Jio transitioning to a top-2 telecom player (25 percent market share). However, it increased target price to Rs 1,200 from Rs 1,020. The brokerage house expects two-pronged strategy from Reliance Jio. &amp;quot;One is for higher ARPU customers, retain data rates lower than incumbents, beyond March 2017, to encourage switching; and&amp;amp;nbsp; second for others (primarily voice), launch an affordable 4G smart feature phone, with upfront payment and nominal monthly payments; in addition, tariffs for the current Rs 149 plan (which incumbents nearly match) may need a re-look as well,&amp;quot; it explains. As this high-competition scenario plays out, Jio can make rapid gains in market share, Credit Suisse says. It expects aggregate industry average revenue per user for next 2 years to stay below FY17 level. Credit Suisse says RIL's refining/petchem projects should commission over the next two quarters, adding USD 3.2 billion to EBITDA at peak. Given FY18 telecom capex and USD 7.8 billion in vendor payables, Reliance (consolidated) turns free cash flow positive in second half of FY19.

According to management, Jio's 4G capacity is nearly 5x of the remaining industry. Jio expects to be able to handle 4 billion GB of data per month by end of 2017. CLSA says Jio is hopeful of fully sorting out interconnection issues in this month and Jio's capacity may warrant a higher EV/EBITDA (enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) multiple of 7.5x. The brokerage house has raised its multiple for refining to 6.5x EV/EBITDA and retail to 1x EV/sales. Bank of America Merrill Lynch says further upside in Reliance Industries shares would require an increase in Jio's perceived valuations. The brokerage house is increasing Jio's EV in its SoTP (sum-of-the-parts) from Rs 87 to Rs 280. BoAML has reiterated its buy call on the stock with increased target price at Rs 1,375 (from Rs 1,200 earlier). Number of Jio Subscribers paying initial Rs 99 will be near-term catalyst, it feels. BoAML estimates completion of chemical projects to lift EBITDA by USD 2.8 billion in FY19. Morgan Stanley is overweight on Reliance Industries, with a target price at Rs 1,506. Energy project execution &amp;amp;amp; clarity on telecom KPI should act as key triggers, it believes. Morgan feels Reliance may achieve EBITDA break-even on telecom investments by end of first year of operations. Goldman Sachs expects company's stock to react positively to management targets on Jio. Value for Jio in company SOTP is USD 4.5 billion based on 0.7x price to FY16 book value, it says. Deutsche Bank says Jio believes the Indian telecom market is likely to grow by 50 percent over five years and Jio's outlook &amp;amp;amp; pricing strategy is in-line with its expectations. Jio believes revenue-share to be driven by share of data capacity among players. Disclosure: Reliance Industries, the parent company of Reliance Jio, owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com. Tata Motors With maintaining outperform rating on Tata Motors and target price of Rs 630, Credit Suisse says newly launched Velar will plug the gap between Evoque &amp;amp;amp; RR Sport and its sell could be 1,00,000 units per annum. The brokerage house expects FY18 to be a strong year for the company. JLR margin should see sharp improvement June quarter onwards, it believes. However, potential US border tax remains key risk to the stock, it feels. Infosys Goldman Sachs has initiated its coverage on Infosys with a sell call and target of Rs 829 as application services is shrinking led by swift contraction in BFSI. It says the company lagged peers in terms of penetration of new digital areas. The company is more exposed to H-1B/L1 visa changes, it feels. According to Goldman, frequent management changes may make it harder to achieve stable growth and growth model is not well-suited to its DNA. Bharti Infratel CLSA says risks for Bharti Infratel are overdone and rising tower merger &amp;amp;amp; acquisition (M&amp;amp;amp;A) is a positive catalyst for it. The stock is now pricing in a pessimistic scenario on growth, it adds. Hence, the brokerage house has upgraded its recommendation to buy from outperform. Coal India Macquarie has underperform rating on Coal India, with a target price at Rs 250 as it has cut FY17 dividend expectation to Rs 15 from Rs 20. CIMB sees no sign of a strong recovery in Coal India as the company is losing market share. Renewables&amp;amp;rsquo; growth could be another headwind, it feels. Headwinds weighed on valuation; hence CIMB has reiterated its reduce call on the stock with unchanged target price at Rs 271. BHEL CIMB has reiterated its reduce rating on BHEL, with a target price of Rs 125 as it feels risks to earnings will persist over FY18-19. According to the research firm, however, key upside risk is any sharp improvement in working capital of the company. United Spirits After the recent uptick, Nomura believes the stock is fairly valued. Hence, it has downgraded to neutral from buy and slashed target price to Rs 2,361 from Rs 2,367. Banning liquor shops on highways leads to 6.3/10.4 percent earnings cuts in FY18/FY19, Nomura says."

The membership fee for Jio Prime will be Rs 99 per year. The unlimited free voice, free data offered in the 'Happy New Year' scheme will be available to Jio Prime members for another 12 months for a price of Rs 303 per month. Jio Prime members will also get the bouquet of Jio media services till March 31, 2018. Besides this plan, Jio plans to roll out two new monthly tariff plans at Rs 149 and Rs 499 which offer 2GB and 60 GB data along with free voice, respectively, according to note by brokerage firm CLSA. &amp;amp;ldquo;As per our discussion with channel partners and retailers, Reliance Jio has revealed more tariff plans under the &amp;amp;ldquo;Jio Prime Program&amp;amp;rdquo; that requires one-time membership charge of Rs 99 to be paid before March 31, 2017,&amp;amp;rdquo; CLSA said in the note.&amp;amp;ldquo;For Jio Prime Members, two more monthly plans will be available other than the Rs 303 plan announced last week. The cheapest monthly plan is Rs 149 which offers free domestic voice and 2GB data without any daily limits. Another plan offers 60 GB (2GB daily data allowance) and unlimited voice for Rs 499,&amp;amp;rdquo; it said. Jio will also offer long duration plans for Rs 999/1999/4999/9999 with validity for 60/90/180/360 days and data allowance of 60/125/350/750GB without any daily limits, according to CLSA. Spelling out the fine print of Jio new tariff plans, the CLSA note stated that while subscription to Jio apps is available to all these plans, the company has limited free voice up to the first 1,000 minutes/month, after which only calls within the Jio network will be free. Also, &amp;quot;Jio Prime membership and its benefits could be cancelled unless a minimum recharge of Rs 149 is made every month,&amp;quot; it said.Jio Tariff After 31st March For users who fail to sign up for the Jio Prime subscription before March 31, Jio will announce standard plans that will&amp;amp;nbsp;not only match the tariff plans of its rivals but will also offer 20 percent more data compared to its peers, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani&amp;amp;nbsp;had said on February 21. Aggressive Push  In his address last week, Ambani had said that Jio crossed 100 million subscribers. Jio will be keen on holding on to these subscribers while adding more users. For this, the telecom company is offering commission rates higher than the industry norm, CLSA said. &amp;amp;ldquo;Our discussion with channel partners reveals that Jio has also offered much higher commission rates of over 6 percent on recharge versus industry average of sub-3 percent. While we find the tariffs quite attractive for data users, high commission rates should provide an added push for high membership of Jio Prime and allow Jio to start with a high chargeable subscriber base,&amp;amp;rdquo; the CLSA note stated. Jio had crossed 50 million subscribers in just 83 days of its launch, adding at an average rate of 6 lakh subscribers per day and surpassing the subscriber addition rates of global giants like Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype. Announcing its third quarter results, Reliance Industries had said that Jio has garnered 72.4 million subscribers as of December 31, 2016. Rivals May Not Catch Up CLSA is apprehensive about the capability of Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and others to match the tariffs offered in Jio Prime plan. &amp;amp;ldquo;These plans again underscore that Jio is playing the capacity game. Given its huge capacity advantage, we believe incumbents may find it difficult to match this offer without impacting user experience on their networks,&amp;quot; it said adding that &amp;quot;While one may find the Rs149/month plan as ARPU dilutive, Jio is possibly using this to entice users into building habits of higher data and video usage as it offers its Jio apps free along with this,&amp;amp;rdquo; it said in the note.The Reliance Jio EffectJio's entry has pushed the telecom sector into a consolidation mode. Last week,&amp;amp;nbsp;India&amp;amp;rsquo;s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel announced that it had entered into &amp;quot;definitive agreement&amp;quot; to acquire Telenor India assets.Meanwhile, Vodafone Plc has also announced that it is in exploratory talks with the Aditya Birla Group's telecom arm Idea Cellular for a merger. &amp;quot;Vodafone confirms that it is in discussions with the Aditya Birla Group about an all share merger of Vodafone India (excluding Vodafone's 42% stake in Indus Towers) and Idea. Any merger would be effected through the issue of new shares in Idea to Vodafone and would result in Vodafone deconsolidating Vodafone India,&amp;quot; Vodafone had said in a statement earlier in February.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which own Jio, also owns Network18 which publishes Moneycontrol)"

RIL stock has underperformed peers by 60 percentage points in the past four years as its returns lagged peers. This is set to change as earnings start from energy projects and telecom monetisation gathers pace, it feels. After nearly doubling its energy business investments in the past four years, the research firm believe RIL's energy earnings are poised to inflect over the next two years, benefiting from slowing oil oversupply, a rising global gas glut, and the start of a polyester upcycle. &amp;quot;We think the ability to leverage these trends sets RIL apart from its global peers and drives our conviction that energy earnings can beat consensus by 12-23 percent,&amp;quot; it says. RIL's vertical integration in the energy value chain has deepened, increasing its flexibility to capitalise on changing energy prices while lowering earnings volatility &amp;amp;ndash; a key differentiator versus global peers, according to Morgan Stanley. It feels company's energy return on capital employed is set to rise 500 basis points by FY20, to 15 percent, in the top five in returns and free cash flow growth globally. The brokerage house says, &amp;quot;The market is discounting about half of our projected growth in energy earnings, assuming our base case telecom NAV.&amp;quot; This reflects concerns about RIL's execution of energy investments &amp;amp;ndash; most of which, it believes, are being de-risked as they are close to commissioning. The research firm says telecom uncertainty has decreased with disclosure on tariff plans, but not subsided completely. It believes energy return on capital employed growth buffers the impact from lower telecom returns in the near term. Disclosures on telecom key performance indicators (KPIs) should be a stock trigger, it says. In the past 23 years, despite low dividend payout, RIL has outperformed in times of free cash flow growth. Although RIL has one of the lowest payouts (against energy peers), the chairman's comments on rewarding shareholders indicate a focus on capital efficiency, Morgan Stanley says, adding a higher dividend over time should trigger outperformance.The stock rallied 6 percent intraday today to hit neary 9-year high of Rs 1,256.50 on value buying, which helped it to cross Rs 4 lakh crore market capitalisation.&amp;amp;nbsp;In four consecutive sessions, it gained nearly 17 percent.

While it will undoubtedly have a positive rub off on RIL, what&amp;amp;rsquo;s surprising is the market&amp;amp;rsquo;s optimism about its competitors. The market appears to be reading this as an end of &amp;amp;lsquo;price war&amp;amp;rsquo; and the beginning of a &amp;amp;lsquo;golden era&amp;amp;rsquo; of pricing discipline, thereby benefitting all in an oligopolistic market place. Since the Jio announcement, shares of Bharti Airtel have ticked up 1 percent, and Idea shares have risen 10 percent. Some of this is due to consolidation talk, and this may be valid reason, but crunching the numbers swiftly dispels happy thoughts about the end of the price war. In terms of revenue, the size of the Indian telecom industry is roughly Rs 2,03,630 crore. Airtel with nearly 28 percent share followed by Vodafone at 21 percent and Idea at 18 percent lead the pack. While in the past couple of years, the cost of spectrum acquisition was the bone of contention, from the latter half of 2016, the industry woke up to the challenge of a competitor who had been creating significant capacity ahead of the launch.The key differentiator for the challenger is clearly the capacity it has put in place. Reliance Jio has the longest fibre optic network in the country, ranging over 2.5 lakh kilometres of fibre. Put this in perspective &amp;amp;ndash; this is more than two times the combined investment of Airtel, Idea and Vodafone in the 4G segment. Once the fibre optic network is in place, the cost of operating it is not very huge. The network can be operated at minimal cost. The network is capable enough to handle amazing internet speeds. It therefore encourages the users to use internet, which is handy because the key is to get more internet users. Given the capex headstart of Jio, if the industry has to benefit from RJio starting to charge for its offering, only those operators with sizeable data coverage and capacity will be able to protect their market shares and benefit from the industry&amp;amp;rsquo;s ARPU (Average Revenue per User) accretion. For most incumbents it will come at higher incremental capex. Thus there appears to be a strong &amp;amp;lsquo;economic rationale&amp;amp;rsquo; for consolidation in the industry, as the individual over-leveraged balance sheet may not be able to support the same. Contrary to popular perception that higher paying customers will stick to their existing service providers, we feel once Jio starts charging, it might decongest the network and encourage more migration from incumbent operators. Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s network coverage appears significantly ahead of others and the company has just announced further capex investments in coming months to add capacity and coverage. Reliance Jio has incurred a total capex of Rs 1,70, 000 crore in telecom and it has further announced capex to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. If we conservatively assume that the company expects a return of a modest 15 percent in the next five years, our calculation suggests that it will have to hit an annual revenue number of at least Rs 1,24,000 crore by FY22.This figure will require at least 306 million subscribers &amp;amp;ndash; 3x of the present subscriber base and nearly 42 percent of the revenue market share. To put the figures in perspective, the current subscriber base of the industry is approximately 1,074 million and Airtel (currently the leader) has 266 million subscribers. India being a well-penetrated voice market, the incremental growth in the market will come from data. So the price war may have temporarily abated, the battle in the &amp;amp;lsquo;data market&amp;amp;rsquo; has just begun.

Reliance Industries stock zoomed by over 10 percent, trading above the Rs 1,200 mark for the first time since 2008.",,"Bharti Airtel, Business, Idea Cellular, Reliance Industries, reliance jio, subscriber base, Telecom",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/comment-heresrils-valuation-jumpone-day-equalled-ideas-m-cap_8541661.html,"Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol Research The market was clearly caught on the wrong foot when Reliance Jio announced that there would be no more free usage for its telecom services. Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;stock zoomed by over 10 percent, trading above the Rs 1,200 mark for the first time since 2008. The incremental jump in market capitalisation of Rs 38,748 crore almost matches the total market capitalisation of Idea Cellular, which stands at Rs 40,501 crore. The expectation was that the company might either continue with its policy of free data and voice until the end of 2017 as it builds up its customer base. Reliance surprised most by announcing a plan of Rs 303 per month for 1 GB per day data and free voice calling for all existing subscribers and new ones who enroll before March 31 by paying Rs 99 as enrollment fee. The figure of Rs 303 per month did the trick for investors. Reports say that Reliance Jio is likely to touch a sales of Rs 1 lakh crore and a subscriber base of 400 million by FY18. For many analysts the tariff plan was a sign that a large portion of the company&amp;amp;rsquo;s balance sheet which was not contributing to the revenue will now be put in play. At Rs 1 lakh crore Jio is expected to contribute nearly one-fourth of the company&amp;amp;rsquo;s revenue of around Rs 4 lakh crore by FY18. Over the past four years analysts were obsessed with Reliance Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s investment. At nearly Rs 2 lakh crore the company had invested about 45 percent of its total capital expenditure over the last four years. However, given the crowded telecom space and initial teething problems in the technology, analysts were not ascribing too much value to the telecom investment in its sum-of-the-parts valuation matrix. Morgan Stanley valued Reliance Jio at Rs 193 per share based on a 0.36 multiple of enterprise value to invested capital. However, in comparison Idea Cellular was trading at a multiple of 1. If Reliance Jio is measured on the same valuation its telecom venture will be valued at Rs 536 per share. Telecom was the only missing link in Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s re-rating. The company is in the last leg of its massive capital expenditure. Analyst Jal Irani, in an interview with CNBC TV18, pointed out that Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s projects in the commissioning stage are almost double its productive assets, and the market has not been giving value to these projects. Further, Reliance is in a sweet spot as far as its telecom venture is concerned. A Credit Suisse report points out that Reliance Jio has 94 percent of India&amp;amp;rsquo;s mobile data traffic. Incumbents like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular are far behind Reliance Jio in terms of both data coverage and 4G coverage, says the report. Stretched balance sheet sat its competitors would help Reliance keep intact a large portion of its customer base, which in any case has been addicted to high-speed data over the last few months. A Goldman Sachs report points out that 10 percent of Indian mobile subscribers with an average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 600 account for 40 percent of industry revenues and this segment would find the Jio offer attractive. Further, Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s offer packs more punch with a 1 GB per day for Rs 303 per month as compared to other players who offer a 1 GB per month pack for similar pricing. Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s plan to cover 99 percent of the country by the end of 2017 and 400 million subscribers from the present level of 100 million has given more visibility to analysts who are now plugging in the new set of numbers to revalue the shares. Reliance Jio, through its free introductory offer, managed to acquire 100 million subscribers, many of whom are believed to be using it as a second SIM in their mobiles. But if the company is able to provide quality high speed connectivity, then its pricing point is just right for Jio to be used as the primary SIM. Little wonder Reliance shares added an Idea Cellular in one day.(Disclosure: RIL, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18 and&amp;amp;nbsp;moneycontrol.com)."

Customer concerns around call failure and likely further cuts from rival telecom companies are key hurdles for Jio, it feels while estimating 50 percent customer retention in FY18. Goldman expects 50 million customers for Jio in FY18 with pre-tax ARPU of Rs 250 driving wireless revenues of USD 2 billion in FY18. Credit Suisse says Jio to start charging is the best of positives for the sector from announcements. It believes nearly 50 percent of revenue for incumbent come from subscribers with more than Rs 300 ARPU. The Rs 303 plan puts an ARPU ceiling on all such subscribers, it feels. According to the research firm, Rs 149 plan by Jio is likely to get sweeter by April. Credit Suisse sees no let down in Jio's competitive aggression. CLSA says Jio's &amp;amp;lsquo;more-for-more strategy&amp;amp;rsquo; targeted at high ARPU and retention. Jio estimates assume 50 percent conversion of active 4G subscribers, aggregating to around 8 percent sector revenues, it feels. If Jio conversions are higher, these will add incremental risks to incumbent forecasts, according to the research firm. CLSA says compulsion on high upfront payment will impact subscriber retention.

Axis Bank Morgan Stanley feels any interest in Axis Bank will be based on its retail franchise as it is one of the few banks with a strong retail deposit franchise.

At a press conference yesterday, Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani said starting April 1, Jio will launch a Prime offer, under which users can opt for its ongoing free calls, free data (subject to 1GB per day) and get access to its media suite for a one-time fee of Rs 99 and a Rs 303 monthly plan. For other subscribers who take up Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s services after April 1, Ambani said the telecom company&amp;amp;rsquo;s tariff plans will offer 20 percent more data than any competitor. In a note to clients, Credit Suisse said it would continue to stay &amp;amp;ldquo;cautious&amp;amp;rdquo; on the stock price outlook for most listed telecom companies as Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s aggressive pricing plans will pressure their revenues, especially from high-value customers. &amp;amp;ldquo;Nearly 50 percent of revenues for incumbent operators like&amp;amp;nbsp;Bharti&amp;amp;nbsp;come from subscribers with Rs 300+ average revenue per user.

The report added that while recent news over mergers and acquisitions in the telecom space &amp;amp;ndash; again thanks to Jio &amp;amp;ndash; had helped shares, &amp;amp;ldquo;we see no let down in&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio's&amp;amp;nbsp;competitive aggression, which is likely to determine earnings for next couple of years.&amp;amp;rdquo; According to Jefferies, the Rs 303 plan was the most &amp;amp;ldquo;disruptive&amp;amp;rdquo; announcement by Jio. Given the way Jio's plans are structured and how incumbents have responded over the past quarter, &amp;amp;ldquo;focus should be solely on ARPU which would also come under pressure,&amp;amp;rdquo; said the Jefferies note to clients. But Jefferies also cautioned that the challenge for R Jio will be to maintain quality of services&amp;amp;nbsp;as there issues relating to point of interconnect and data speeds, which according to TRAI have been lower than Airtel. These would put to test Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to retain customers once they start charging for services, it said. Ambani yesterday announced that Jio, which launched services on September 5 last year, had continued to add subscribers at a healthy rate, crossing 10 crore subscribers in less than 6 months of launch. Market leader Bharti Airtel has 26.5 crore subscribers. Idea, which is in merger talks with Vodafone, has 18.5 crore. The RIL chief added that Jio carried 1 billion GB of data on its network last month -- 5.8 times and 10 times that of Airtel and Idea respectively, according to Jefferies &amp;amp;ndash; while 55 million hours of videos being used daily. Ambani also said the company will increase its coverage ratio of 99 percent of the country&amp;amp;rsquo;s population by 2017 end."

The tariff plans will start from April 1, 2017 as its Happy New Year offer which gave 1 GB of free data per day ends on March 31. In the new plan,&amp;amp;nbsp;domestic voice calls will be free even after April 1, 2017. As for data, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said that Jio will offer 20 percent more data than&amp;amp;nbsp;the best plan offered by any rival operator. Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s aggressive pricing suggests that the price war is here to stay. Telecom companies were banking on data as the driver for growth. December quarter numbers clearly showed the impact of Reliance Jio offer on these companies. Idea Cellular posted a 6.9 percent drop in its revenue and a 550 basis points drop in operating profit on a quarter on quarter basis. On account of its high operating loss the company ended up posting a loss of Rs 380 crore. Bharti Airtel on the other hand saw its revenue fall by 5 percent and consolidated EBIDTA by 10 percent. Its presence in other markets helped the company cushion the impact of its India performance. Though Vodafone does not disclose its Indian numbers separately, its parent company had recorded a non-cash impairment charge of five&amp;amp;nbsp;billion Euros for the six months ended 30th September 2016, highlighting the pressure in its Indian operations. However, December 2016 quarter impact will be smaller than that in March 2017 quarter when the first full quarter of Jio impact would be felt on the telcos. Market will be closely watching the stickiness of Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s 100 million consumers post the scheme launch. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for data of Idea and Bharti is Rs 200 per subscriber per month and a wireless ARPU of Rs 160 per user per month. Reliance has priced its product at Rs 303 to attract a major portion of the fastest growing data market. An important point worth noting is that the scheme announced by Reliance is a prepaid one meant to tap the low-end users. By offering a limited window of March 1 to March 31 for availing of Jio Prime Membership Programme, Reliance wants to add as many members as possible to its list before the revenue plan goes live. But whether the pricing is attractive enough to retain a portion of its present consumers intact will depend on how the other telecom players place themselves. The impact on them will actually be felt post April and the June quarter will be the most keenly awaited one for these telecom players. Here is a back-of-the-envelope calculation to show where Reliance is relative to its rivals. Based on the pricing announced by Reliance, it would require the company to have 100 million subscribers to the Jio Prime Membership Programme for its quarterly revenues to match Idea Cellular&amp;amp;rsquo;s standalone quarterly revenue and 170 million to match Bharti Airtel&amp;amp;rsquo;s quarterly revenue. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s difficult to predict, but if 60 percent of current users stay and another 40 million sign up, it would mean that Jio is already at par with Idea, and would have exceeded Idea if there were migrations away from the Birla group company. Given Reliance&amp;amp;rsquo;s history and modus operandi the company would continue with its aggressive pricing till it gets a lion&amp;amp;rsquo;s share of the market. Consolidation in the industry is unlikely to deter Reliance in its aggressive posture for gaining market share.

The country's telecom regulator had earlier recommended a combined penalty of Rs 3,050 crore on Idea, Airtel and Vodafone for denying Reliance Jio adequate points of interconnect in most telecom circles. It&amp;amp;nbsp;contended that the carriers&amp;amp;rsquo; actions appeared to be&amp;amp;nbsp;aimed at stifling competition and were against public interest.&amp;amp;nbsp;5:00 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Moneycontrol's Shishir Asthana weighs in with a comment piece on what Jio's plans&amp;amp;nbsp;could mean for the industry. Do read:Jio's pricing suggests bloodbath ahead for other telcos&amp;amp;nbsp;4:45 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Before Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s launch, incumbent operators were on an average charging Rs 250 per GB of data. With the Jio Prime Offer announced on Tuesday exclusively for its 100 million subscribers, the price of 1 GB of data has effectively been beaten down to Rs 10.4:30 PM RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani sent out a subtle message to Jio's competitors while announcing the new tariff plans. Here's what he said:&amp;quot;In the last few months, hundreds of offers have been launched by the industry. These plans have created a lot of confusion in the markets and customers are having what I call 'data&amp;amp;nbsp;and value anixety',&amp;amp;nbsp;whether they are getting the best value for the price that they are paying.&amp;quot;4:15 PM It's going to be interesting to see how other telecom operators react. Jio has basically thrown down the gauntlet by saying whatever data plans you offer, we will give 20% more data for the same price.4:00 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio users consume nearly as much mobile data&amp;amp;nbsp;as the entire United States of America, and nearly 50 percent more mobile data&amp;amp;nbsp;than all of China.3:46 PM Analysts tracking the telecom sector point out that Jio's announcement of charging customers post April is actually beneficial for incumbents as they can now compete on tariffs and work to retain customers.&amp;amp;nbsp;3:38 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Full text of RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani's speech on Jio 3:34 PM If you want mega returns, you need panic and that panic which was there in telecom three-four months back is missing now.

R Jio puts question on Idea&amp;amp;rsquo;s positioning as&amp;amp;nbsp;the third largest operator, partially offset by the merger discussion with Vodafone, said the report.3:22 PM In an interview with CNBC-TV18&amp;amp;nbsp;GV Giri, Head of Research at IIFL said that there should be a healthy reasonable concentration of market power in the hands of these three-four players compared to what we have seen in the last 7-8 years because that has been very detrimental for their profitability and their ability to invest. 3:17 PM Tata Teleservices &amp;amp;nbsp;and&amp;amp;nbsp; Reliance Communications-Aircel-MTS combine are reportedly considering joining forces to counter the tough competition from Reliance Jio Infocomm, reported the Economic Times yesterday. In the light of possible mergers, a few strong players will come to dominate the market.3:15 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;The telecom industry is heading for a consolidation with Vodafone and Idea merger around the corner.&amp;amp;nbsp;If the deal is successful, the combined entity will create India's largest telecom firm with a revenue share of around 40 percent and a subscriber base of over 380 million, according to India Ratings and Research.&amp;amp;nbsp;3:05 PM 9 key takeaways2:42 PM Read: Mukesh Ambani: Jio crosses 100mn customers, to cover 99% of population in 20172:30 PM Other financial dailies -- The Economic Times and Business Standard -- have also reported on Ambani's Jio briefing.2:27 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Mahesh Uppal of Com First India said that the viability model of the sector is under a cloud, although it is good news for customers.2:25 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Shares of Idea Cellular fell nearly 2 percent intraday, while Bharti Airtel fell over 3 percent intraday, following the announcements.2:23 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Telecom stocks fell between two and three percent intraday, possibly following the positive announcements made by Ambani for its Jio customers.&amp;amp;nbsp;2:18 PM Listed companies were waiting for Jio to start charging customers. From hereon, the case for incumbents improves a little bit, says an analyst.2:17 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Ambani&amp;amp;nbsp;needs to increase market share. He has largest market share in terms of traffic in data. He wants users and eventually a share of revenues. It is good for the consumer. It will take a huge pressure off the incumbents., says an analyst.2:13 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Airtel is down by 2.3 percent.

Last month, Jio users consumed more than 100 crore gigabytes of data.&amp;amp;nbsp;1:55 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio has added&amp;amp;nbsp;7 customers on its network every single second of every single day within those 170 days, says Ambani.1:50 PM&amp;amp;nbsp;Ambani begins speech.

The question on everyone's mind is whether Jio will look to extend the offer? The other option, according to CNBC-TV18, could be that Jio may start a commercial launch. Analysts say the company is likely to announce plans for new subscribers.For Bharti and&amp;amp;nbsp;Idea, voice and data revenues fell in excess of 10 percent on a quarter on quarter basis in Q3.  Jio acquired 50 million subscribers in 83 days since commercial launch on September 5 and 100 million in 170 days. In this period, industry&amp;amp;rsquo;s total connection growth rates have declined.&amp;amp;nbsp;1:10 PM Last week, in Nasscom Leadership summit, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said his telecom venture Jio has crossed a customer base of 100 million. &amp;quot;When we started Jio, we set a target for ourselves that we will acquire 100 million customers in shortest time. Even we didn't imagine that we would do it in months,&amp;quot; Ambani said. Jio crossed 50 million subscribers in just 83 days, adding at an average rate of 6 lakh subscribers per day and surpassing the subscriber addition rates of global giants like Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype.Speaking at the summit, Ambani said data will be the &amp;amp;ldquo;next oil&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ndash; reinforcing an opinion he had expressed at the launch of the multi-billion dollar Reliance Jio venture &amp;amp;ndash; and said it would trigger the fourth revolution.Analysts say that Jio might not go for a commercial launch, given the fact that interconnect issues aren't sorted out yet. According to an article in the Economic Times, it is estimated that about 40 percent of voice calls will be riding on VoLTE (voice over LTE technology with 4G) by 2020.

Government of India has named former Supreme Court Judge G S Singhvi as its nominee on the three-member arbitration panel, while RIL and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources have named former UK High Court Judge Bernard Eder to the panel. &amp;quot;The two arbitrators (appointed by Government and RIL-BP) have agreed on Boo as the third/presiding arbitrator,&amp;quot; a senior Oil Ministry official said. &amp;quot;The Arbitral Tribunal is fully constituted now.&amp;quot; The full arbitration panel was constituted in less than three months of RIL-BP-Niko slapping an arbitration notice on November 11 last year, thereby showing intent of quickly resolving the sticky issue, he said. Normally, it can take up to an year for the full panel to be constituted. The Oil Ministry had on November 3 last year issued a notice to RIL, Niko and UK's BP Plc seeking USD 1.47 billion for producing in the seven years ended March 31, 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal. After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources. The official said the arbitration will now get underway. The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee. The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016 report, concluded that there has been &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML. The government, the official said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from RIL-BP-Niko for &amp;quot;the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained&amp;quot;. So, a notice was sent, he said, adding that the government is also pressing RIL to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than targets. The cost recovery issue is also being arbitrated separately. Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL. Under direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah however said the compensation should go to government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.Reliance Industries owns TV18 Broadcast and Network 18 (that publishes Moneycontrol.com)"

The NSE Nifty retook the crucial 8,800-mark today. At its last policy review in December, RBI in a surprise move had decided to leave rates unchanged, but this time a lower retail inflation and fiscal discipline as shown in the Budget have prompted calls for RBI to remain accommodative. Global leads aligned as most Asian shares ended higher, tracking weekend gains in the US on better-than-expected jump in US jobs and a move by President Donald Trump to cut back financial regulations, accelerating buying pace by investors. The 30-share Sensex ended up 198.76 points, or 0.70 percent at 28,439.28, its highest closing since September 23 last year when it had closed at 28,668.22. Intra-day, it sprang to a high of 28,487.28. The gauge had rallied 584.56 points in the previous three sessions after the presentation of the Budget on February 1. The NSE Nifty regained control of the 8,800-mark and added 60.10 points, or 0.69 percent, at 8,801.05 at the close. On September 23, the index finished at 8,831.55. &amp;quot;Markets continued to be buoyant on the expectation of rate cut by RBI and positive global cues. We are seeing continuation of rally in the rate sensitive sectors led by reality, banks and FMCG which were also supported by Budget related sops,&amp;quot; said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. Major European indices stayed in the positive zone, too. Data showed that foreign institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 353.84 crore last Friday, adding to the level of optimism. The rupee appreciated for the 9th straight day to trade at a fresh 2-1/2 month high of 67.14 (intra-day) against the dollar, keeping the overall mood upbeat. A good 22 stocks in the 30-share Sensex pack advanced while 8 turned lower. Sun Pharma led the charge by surging 4.20 percent while ICICI Bank zoomed 3.18 percent. Adani Ports, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ITC Ltd, HUL, GAIL, NTPC, Asian Paints, Wipro, RIL, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and L&amp;amp;amp;T supported the ongoing bull run. BSE realty jumped the most (up 1.90 percent) followed by FMCG (1.28 percent), healthcare (1.27 percent) and consumer durables (1.27 percent). Broader markets remained in the green too, with the mid-cap index advancing 1.10 percent and small-cap 0.88 percent. Realty stocks continued their upward journey, buoyed by the infrastructure status to affordable housing in the Budget 2017-18 to encourage investment in the segment, which offered tax sops to developers to complete unsold inventories. In the realty space, HDIL soared 7.80 percent, Godrej Properties surged 3.32 percent, Prestige Estates Projects 2.83 percent and DLF 1.32 percent. Asian shares, led by Hong Kong, closed higher.

RIL has restated its reserves following a change in accounting standards from April 1, 2016. It has moved from the Full-Cost Method (Indian GAAP) to the Successful-Efforts Method under IND AS. This has led to devaluation of its oil and gas assets by Rs 39,570 crore as on March 31, 2016, according to RIL's third quarter earning statement. The write down investments reflects plummeting oil and gas prices. &amp;quot;The impact on account of change in accounting policy from FCM to SEM is recognised in the Opening Reserves on the date of transition and consequential impact of depletion and write offs is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account,&amp;quot; RIL said. Major differences impacting such change of accounting policy are in the areas of expenditure on surrendered blocks, unproved wells, abandoned wells, seismic and expired leases and licenses, it said. Transiting from one accounting method to another requires going back to the time when that asset was acquired and calculating its present book value if successful completion had been followed since then. RIL has taken a Rs 20,114 crore write-down on its KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal. In the October-December quarter, the company reported a pre-tax loss of Rs 295 crore from its oil and gas business mainly because of &amp;quot;continuing decline in domestic production and weak price realisations&amp;quot;. Gas price for KG-D6 reduced to USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit from USD 3.06 per mmBtu earlier. Its US shale performance improved q-o-q with higher realisations despite lower production. US shale production in 3Q FY17 was down 9 per cent at 37.5 billion cubic feet but price realisation was up 12 per cent at USD 2.85 per thousand cubic feet. KG-D6 production stood at 7.5 million standard cubic meters per day and 3,329 barrels per day of oil.

We expect RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s GRMs to be between &amp;amp;#36;10.0-11.5/bbl in FY17 (will go up by &amp;amp;#36;2.5/bbl post commissioning of petcoke regasification terminal). We expect margins to remain stable in petchem segment along with the petchem capacity addition and operational optimization. We also remain very positive on Jio and believe that it will start contributing to the top line from FY 18 onwards. We recommend BUY with the target price of INR 1,457/share based on SOTP methodology.

The two signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the same at last week's Vibrant Gujarat Summit in Gandhinagar, RIL said in a statement without giving investment details. The unit, to be set up at RIL's integrated petrochemical site in Jamnagar, Gujarat, &amp;quot;will produce 60,000 tonnes of halogenated butyl rubber every year under Reliance Sibur Elastomers Pvt Ltd (RSEPL), a joint venture in which RIL owns 74.9 percent and Sibur 25.1 percent&amp;quot;, it said. Halogenated butyl rubber is used to manufacture tubeless tyres. Apart from the planned halogenation unit, the joint venture owns a 1,20,000-tonne per annum butyl rubber plant, currently under construction at the same venue which will provide the necessary butyl rubber feed to the halogenation unit. Nikhil Meswani, Executive Director, RIL, said, &amp;quot;RSEPL's halogenated butyl rubber plant will be well-poised to capitalise on the significant surge in regional demand in tyre and pharmaceutical industries.&amp;quot; India, he said, is expected to see a quantum jump in tyre production, with domestic and international tyre majors lining up Rs 15,000 crore of investment. &amp;quot;The halogenated butyl rubber demand is expected to grow at a rapid pace of 8-10 percent CAGR over the next few years, driven by increasing customer preference for tubeless tyres in India and neighbouring countries, and significant investments in manufacturing of pharmaceutical closures and tank inner liners,&amp;quot; he said. Sibur Chairman Dmitry Konov said India offers attractive investment opportunities, given the growing local demand for synthetic rubbers and Gujarat's favourable investment environment, coupled with the well-developed infrastructure and raw material. &amp;quot;Sibur has a long track record of successful cooperation with RIL and Gujarat government, which has provided us with a solid basis for expanding our footprint in India,&amp;quot; he said. Halogenated butyl rubber is a key ingredient for manufacturing inner liner of tubeless tyre. With the Indian automobile trend aligning with global trends, penetration of tubeless tyres is expected to accelerate in the Indian market, resulting in an increased demand of halogenated butyl rubber. The ingredient is also used in the manufacturing of pharma stoppers and inner liner of storage tanks. &amp;quot;Construction of the butyl rubber plant is in full swing at Jamnagar, its commissioning targeted for 2018,&amp;quot; the statement said, adding that production from RSEPL will substitute imports and reduce outflow of valuable foreign exchange from India.

ONGC had floated a tender to charter hire two deepwater drilling rigs and one anchor moored rig for bringing gas in Bay of Bengal block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, which sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 fields, to production. &amp;quot;We have received tremendous response to the tender. International drilling contractors have bid very aggressively,&amp;quot; an official said. ONGC is among the very few explorers around the world who are actually going ahead with the development campaign despite low oil prices. &amp;quot;And naturally, contractors have no new job outside and so they are queueing up here,&amp;quot; he said. Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd offered Deepwater Millenium, Discoverer India and Discoverer Luanda deepwater rigs while Ensco Maritime Ltd offered two of its rigs, Ensco 8500 and Ensco 8501. Other bidders include Seadrill Orion Ltd, Drillship Kythnos Owners Inc, Dupont Maritime LLC, Dynamic Drilling &amp;amp;amp; Services, Ensco Maritime Ltd, Queiroz Galvano Leo Gas, Seadrill Orion, Universial Energy Resources Ind, Vantage International management Co and Japan Drilling Co. ONGC is investing USD 5.07 billion for developing Cluster-II discoveries in KG-D5 block to flow natural gas from from June 2019 and oil by March 2020. The 7,294.6-sq-km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA&amp;amp;nbsp;3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA&amp;amp;nbsp;3,494 sq km). The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. These finds have been clubbed in three groups&amp;amp;nbsp; Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III. Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up currently because of a dispute with RIL over migration of gas from ONGC blocks, the official said. From Cluster-II, a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day is envisaged within two years of start of production. Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic meters per day by end-2021. Cluster-2A mainly comprises of oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA, which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas. Cluster-2B, which is made up of four gas finds&amp;amp;nbsp;R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA&amp;amp;nbsp;envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas, the official said, adding that peak output is likely to last 7 years. Cluster-III is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA in ultra- deepsea that poses technological challenges. Disclosure: Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp; owns Network18 media and Moneycontrol.com."
