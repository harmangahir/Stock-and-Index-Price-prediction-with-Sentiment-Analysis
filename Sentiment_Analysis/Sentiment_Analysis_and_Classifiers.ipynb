Instead of building our own lexicon to do this, we will use VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a pre-trained sentiment analysis model included in the NLTK package.

              "2       The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University has been approved by the Indian drug regulator for emergency use, Reuters reported.\\n\\nIndia has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases after the US. The AstraZeneca (AZN)/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine is being made locally in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and is branded COVISHIELD.\\n\\nAs per Reuters, another vaccine, called COVAXIN, which has been developed locally in India by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research, has also been granted emergency use authorization.\\n\\nOn December 30, AstraZeneca announced that its COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use in the UK for the active immunization of individuals 18 years or older. The authorization recommends two doses administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks. The company is working with its global partners to ramp up its manufacturing capacity of up to three billion vaccine doses globally in 2021 on a rolling basis, pending regulatory approvals.\\n\\nAstraZeneca’s vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings. (See AZN stock analysis on TipRanks)\\n\\nIn December 2020, Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Purcell upgraded AstraZeneca to Buy from Hold and selected it as a preferred large-cap growth stock across the European biopharma sector. One of the reasons cited for the rating upgrade was the strength of the company’s cancer drugs, Calquence and Farxiga.

              "4       LONDON — The U.K. has started rolling out the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, marking another step in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nThe country's National Health Service (NHS) is the first in the world to deploy the jab after it was approved for use in the U.K. by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) last week. The NHS said 82-year-old Brian Pinker was the first person in the world to receive the jab Monday morning.\\n\\nThe approval and deployment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as a boon in the race against Covid-19 as it is cheaper than alternatives created by Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna.\\n\\nAdditionally, and unlike rival vaccines, it can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2 to 8 degrees Celsius or 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months.\\n\\nWhen the vaccine was approved last week, AstraZeneca said it aimed \"to supply millions of doses in the first quarter\" as part of its deal with the U.K. government to supply up to 100 million doses in total.\\n\\nAs a two-dose vaccine, the agreement means up to 50 million people in the U.K., which has a population of around 66 million, could be inoculated.\\n\\nIn a statement Monday, the U.K. government said that more than half a million doses are now available \"with tens of millions more to be delivered in the coming weeks and months once batches have been quality checked by the MHRA.\"\\n\\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine adds to a Covid-19 immunization program already started by Britain in December, when it started rolling out the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. More than a million people in the U.K. have already been vaccinated with the Pfizer shot, according to the government. It stated Monday that more than 730 vaccination sites have been established across the U.K. and that hundreds more are opening this week.\\n\\nAs with the Pfizer vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot will be rolled out to priority groups first, including care home residents and staff, people aged over 80 and health and care workers, then to the rest of the population in order of age and risk, including those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.---newarticle---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

              "1209    By Ben Hirschler\\n\\nLONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline is just an \"interested observer\" as U.S. drugmaker Pfizer battles to win British rival AstraZeneca in a potential $100 billion (59.21 billion pounds) deal, GSK's chief executive said on Wednesday.\\n\\nAndrew Witty said he hoped Pfizer would take a \"rational\" decision to keep drug research in Britain if the deal went through, but he played down the idea that GSK might intervene as a \"white knight\" counterbidder.\\n\\n\"It's not appropriate for me to get into commentary on this particular transaction that is potentially going on around us, but obviously if there was anything specific that we were thinking of I would absolutely be obliged to tell you about it,\" he told reporters on a conference call for first-quarter results on Wednesday.\\n\\nWitty has insisted for several years that he has no desire to engage in mega-mergers, which he sees as disruptive, and he reiterated that he much preferred targeted transactions, such as last week's asset swap with Novartis .\\n\\n\"What we're focused on is ensuring that our organisation is not distracted in the core R&D business,\" he said.\\n\\nAstraZeneca, Britain's second-biggest drugmaker behind GSK, is an important part of Britain's life sciences sector, employing nearly 7,000 staff in the country, and the prospect of it being acquired by Pfizer has sparked political concerns about big job cuts.\\n\\nPfizer has made two approaches to AstraZeneca, both of which have been rebuffed. The company is widely expected to come back with a revised offer before a May 26 deadline for it to \"put up or shut up\" under UK takeover rules.\\n\\nThe U.S. firm says it views Britain as an attractive location for both pharmaceutical research and manufacturing - helped by recent government tax incentives - but cannot make any firm commitments on future investment or jobs.\\n\\nWitty, a long-time cheerleader for British science, who has also advised Prime Minister David Cameron on the country's university system, said Britain had established a particularly attractive environment for life sciences companies.\\n\\nPart of that reflects efforts to reduce overall corporation tax rates, but the pharmaceuticals sector also enjoys a further boost thanks to the so-called \"patent box\" system, which came into effect last year and offers a special 10 percent tax rate on profits earned from patents.\\n\\n\"I would really hope that rational people under any circumstance would choose to invest or continue to invest where there is great talent and there is a great environment for that investment,\" Witty said.\\n\\n\"That's why we invest in Britain. We don't just invest because Andrew Witty has a British passport.\"\\n\\n(Editing by Erica Billingham)---newarticle---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Citing people with knowledge of the matter, the report said a new bid may value AstraZeneca at more than 50 pounds per share and could come as early as next week. Pfizer disclosed earlier this week that it had twice approached AstraZeneca about a takeover, only to be rebuffed in both cases. Pfizer officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

              "1211    By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim\\n\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Rumours about a massive healthcare deal were circulating in industry circles, months before Pfizer Inc disclosed its $100 billion pursuit of Britain's AstraZeneca Plc , according to several industry bankers and lawyers.\\n\\nAs rivals and bankers assessed what it could mean for different companies in the industry, one aspect touched nearly everyone: what it could mean for an increasingly popular U.S. tax loophole.\\n\\nU.S. healthcare companies worried that if a household name like Pfizer changed its domicile to Britain to lower its tax rate as a result of a deal with AstraZeneca, it would spur Congress into action and close the tax arbitrage opportunity, called tax inversion, for everyone else, these people said.\\n\\nThe fear of such an outcome - even though it is likely many months, if not years, away - added new urgency to companies such as Botox-maker Allergan Inc and generic drugmaker Mylan Inc that were already looking at European targets, people familiar with these situations said.\\n\\nAllergan declined to comment. Its CEO David Pyott has said that he would be uncomfortable doing a deal where the tax benefit, and not strategy, was the principal driver. Mylan could not be immediately reached for comment.\\n\\nNow that Pfizer's plans are out in the open, pitching by bankers on inversion targets has reached a fever pitch. While tax arbitrage deals have so far largely been in the pharmaceutical sector, bankers and lawyers said U.S. technology, consumer and industrial companies are also now looking into the possibility of doing a tax inversion deal.\\n\\nOne banker, who declined to be identified because he is actively advising companies on such deals, said the Pfizer plan \"will get people to try to move a lot quicker\" so that they can get a deal \"grandfathered in\" before any possible law change.\\n\\nWASHINGTON WORRIES\\n\\nTax inversions allow U.S. companies, which face one of the highest tax rates in the world - a federal tax rate of 35 percent, and an overall rate that can be close to 40 percent including state and local taxes - to move to a lower-tax country by buying or creating a new holding company.\\n\\nSince 2008, about two dozen U.S. companies have used the strategy, versus about the same number over the previous 25 years, according to a Reuters review of transactions.\\n\\nIreland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada and Britain lately have been the most common destinations of U.S. companies seeking new tax domiciles. The U.K. tax rate for companies is due to drop to 20 percent from 21 percent next year.\\n\\nThis year, most of those deals have happened in healthcare, which is in the midst of an unprecedented bout of deal-making. More than a $153 billion (90.6 billion pounds) worth of deals have already been announced so far this year in the sector, the highest since Thomson Reuters began tracking data. Several more are in the works, and many of those have tax arbitrage as one of the crucial drivers for the transaction as well.\\n\\nAs the industry had feared, Pfizer’s plans have triggered concerns in Washington, with lawmakers calling for comprehensive tax reform. On Wednesday, a U.S. Treasury official said the Obama administration is seeking ways to curb tax-dodging by U.S. businesses that reincorporate overseas.\\n\\n\"Inversion transactions illustrate the need for comprehensive business tax reform that would lower corporate tax rates and limit the ability of multinationals to shift income outside the U.S.,\" the Treasury official said, noting that the administration knows such deals \"are occurring and aren’t being caught by the current rules.\"\\n\\nAnalysts and lawmakers say the chances of Congress passing a new law anytime before the November mid-term U.S. elections are slim given the gridlock between Democrats and Republicans over the tax reform question. They expect Congress to take up tax reform sometime next year.\\n\\n\"Without some kind of tax reform in this country, there are huge benefits to large multinationals re-domiciling into more tax-friendly jurisdictions,\" Ray McGuire, Citigroup Inc's global head of corporate and investment banking, told an M&A panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles earlier this week.\\n\\nNOT ALL ARBITRAGE\\n\\nWhile tax advantages have become a major driver for deals, bankers and lawyers said their clients in general are thinking of business needs first when assessing potential targets.\\n\\nThe frenzied dealmaking in healthcare comes as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics.\\n\\n\"People may be pitching clients to do inversions now because of a concern that the rules may change over time, but the companies we deal with every day are thoughtful about these things and do not just chase deals for tax purposes alone,” said Gordon Caplan, a partner at Wilkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.\\n\\nBuying AstraZeneca, for example, would boost Pfizer's pipeline of cancer drugs and generate significant cost savings. But it would also allow it to re-domicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates.\\n\\nU.S. drugmaker Mylan, which has been seeking to buy Swedish drugmaker Meda AB , was looking to do an inversion deal because it was at a disadvantage compared to foreign generic rivals, people close to the matter said. Major competitors include Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd , which is based in Israel, and Actavis Plc , which re-domiciled to Ireland through a 2013 acquisition of Warner Chilcott. Both face lower tax rates.\\n\\nMylan, these people said, is also worried that if it doesn’t complete an acquisition, it would be bought by another company that has already completed an inversion.\\n\\nSimilarly, Allergan first approached Shire Plc in recent months in part because of the tax arbitrage opportunity. But now it, too, faces the prospect of being swallowed up by an unwanted bidder, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc in partnership with activist investor Bill Ackman. That has prompted Allergan to consider once again making a bid for Shire, despite being rebuffed when it made a previous overture, sources told Reuters earlier this week.\\n\\n\"There is a sense that the government will change the tax rules, when and if they get around to rewriting the tax code as they have talked about doing,\" said one M&A lawyer who is working on these deals and therefore did not want to be identified. \"So if people want to do these deals they better do them soon.\"\\n\\n(Additional reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh in Washington and Greg Roumeliotis in Los Angeles; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Martin Howell)---newarticle---\n",
              "1212    By Ben Hirschler\\n\\nCAMBRIDGE England (Reuters) - In Pfizer's ( ) $100 billion (59.19 billion pounds) battle to win British drugmaker AstraZeneca ( ), business and politics meet in a grassy field on the edge of the historic university city of Cambridge.\\n\\nThis is where AstraZeneca plans to open a new $500 million research and corporate headquarters by 2016 - the centrepiece of CEO Pascal Soriot's plan to overhaul the company and, the government hopes, a new beacon for British life sciences.\\n\\nMinisters have little ultimate leverage over Pfizer but have insisted in talks this week with the company's boss Ian Read that he push ahead with the planned Cambridge facility if he buys AstraZeneca, according to people familiar with the matter.\\n\\n\"That centre in Cambridge and the investment that’s going in there is a significant part of the UK’s developing science skills base,” Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said on Thursday.\\n\\nBut Pfizer, which wants to acquire AstraZeneca partly to make cost savings, argues it cannot give any promises on future investment and jobs until AstraZeneca engages in discussions and allows it to see its books.\\n\\n“We are in early stages and it is premature to speculate on any specific impact this would have on facilities,” a Pfizer spokesman said.\\n\\nAstraZeneca has rebuffed two approaches by Pfizer which is expected to come back with a revised offer before a May 26 deadline for it to \"put up or shut up\" under UK takeover rules.\\n\\nThe stand-off shows how governments are struggling in the face of a wave of cross-border deal-making involving multinational corporations.\\n\\nFrance, with a long history of industrial intervention, is finding it has little room to manoeuvre against General Electric's ( ) ambitions to buy the power business of TGV train-maker Alstom .\\n\\nIn Britain, the position is reversed. Here the government champions open markets but behind the scenes officials are fighting hard to ensure an outcome in the national interest.\\n\\nPHONEY WAR\\n\\nIt is, so far, a phoney war as Pfizer has yet to make a firm bid. But analysts and bankers are in little doubt it will push ahead, either by sweetening the earlier offer to engage the British firm or by taking its approach directly to shareholders.\\n\\n\"History teaches us that Pfizer usually gets what it wants in the end,\" said Savvas Neophytou, an analyst at brokerage Panmure Gordon, pointing to past successful takeovers of big rivals like Wyeth, Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.\\n\\nAstraZeneca said it remained committed to its current strategy, including plans to move 1,600 scientists and 400 head office staff to the new Cambridge site, among them Soriot and his top lieutenants who will run global operations from here.\\n\\nWhether Pfizer - which already has a Cambridge R&D unit called Neusentis focused on pain and regenerative medicine - will see things the same way is far from certain.\\n\\n\"They're a really good company but I don't know whether they'd want this site,\" said one local employee with the Medical Research Council, which recently struck a major deal for its staff to work alongside AstraZeneca scientists in Cambridge.\\n\\nHe declined to be identified, given the sensitivity of the issue.\\n\\nAstraZeneca scientists preparing to move to Cambridge are also nervous - not least because many are relocating from an old research hub in Alderley Park, near Manchester, where house prices are far lower, making the move a major personal financial commitment.\\n\\nCambridge member of parliament Julian Huppert said it was essential for the government to take a firm line to safeguard jobs and science skills. AstraZeneca employs 6,700 staff in Britain.\\n\\n\"It's disappointing that Pfizer have so far been unable to give any clear commitment and that has to raise a lot of concerns,\" he told Reuters.\\n\\n\"The government must extract clear commitments both to the Cambridge move but also to things like advanced manufacturing in Macclesfield. It is very important that we don't lose these skilled jobs.\"\\n\\nSCOTSMAN, FRENCHMAN, SWEDE\\n\\nBut the reality is that both drugmakers are very global - as highlighted by the fact that Pfizer is run by a Scotsman, while AstraZeneca has a French CEO and a Swedish chairman in Leif Johansson - so forcing a deal on Pfizer may not be easy.\\n\\nNonetheless, there may be some room for give and take. \"You could envisage a deal whereby Pfizer commits to Cambridge in some way in exchange for government goodwill, good cooperation with the National Health Service, and so on,\" said one industry insider.\\n\\nBritain has been burnt before on foreign takeovers, notably Kraft's ( ) 2010 acquisition of Cadbury, when the U.S. food group promised to keep open a key factory, only to go back on the pledge soon after the deal was completed.\\n\\nPfizer's reputation is also under a cloud following a decision three years ago to shut most of its research work at a large R&D centre in Sandwich, southern England, where Viagra was invented, with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.\\n\\nAs a result, British lawmakers intend to investigate the planned takeover.\\n\\nThere seems little prospect Pfizer will face a bidding war for AstraZeneca. GlaxoSmithKline ( ), Britain's biggest drugmaker which could potentially make the biggest cost savings by combining with AstraZeneca, said on Wednesday it was just an \"interested observer\".\\n\\nOne reason why Pfizer seems unlikely to face a challenger is that few other companies can match the tax benefits it will be able to extract from buying AstraZeneca.\\n\\nPfizer has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries, which if repatriated to the United States would be heavily taxed. Buying AstraZeneca would avoid that, while also providing the chance to re-domicile for tax purposes in Britain, bringing down its corporate tax rate, giving it a big incentive to make sure a takeover gets done.\\n\\n(Additional reporting by Mark Potter and William James; editing by Anna Willard)---newarticle---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

            "The use of plants to produce life-saving pharmaceuticals captured global attention when it was revealed that the Ebola drug ZMapp is produced in the leaves of tobacco plants.\n",

            "Even as Ebola cases multiply in West Africa, a far greater market for plant-based biopharmaceuticals will likely be influenza vaccines used to fight pandemics, industry experts said. Making vaccines from plants may turn out to be faster and cheaper than current methods which use chicken eggs to grow the virus needed to make the vaccines.\n",
            "\n",
            "Leading producers such as GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L: ) and Sanofi SA (PA: ) need six months to produce flu vaccine once scientists identify the dominant virus expected to circulate during flu season. Vaccine production from tobacco plants by Quebec City-based Medicago or Bryan, Texas-based Caliber Biotherapeutics could do it in weeks.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Seven to 10 years from now, plants might be the dominant vaccine-production system,\" said Brett Giroir, an M.D. and CEO of Texas A&M Health Science Centre in Bryan. Texas A&M has one of three U.S. facilities tasked by the government with being ready to produce and deliver 50 million doses of flu vaccine in just 12 weeks. It is working with Caliber toward that goal.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the upstarts succeed, they will make little difference to the tobacco industry, which regards even a $3 billion market as marginal. But they could threaten the pharma giants that dominate flu vaccine production - or be gobbled up by them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Medicago is now testing its flu vaccine in elderly people, who are most at risk, and plans to launch a large human trial in 2016. \"We hope to hit the market in 2019,\" said Jean-Luc Martre, director of government affairs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tobacco plants could be enlisted in the fight against flu even sooner if a pandemic hit. The 50 million doses that labs like Texas A&M's pledged they'd be able to produce in a few months can't be manufactured in today's egg-based systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"If there is a need for it that requires plant-based production, we'd turn to Caliber,\" said Giroir, referring to an accelerated vaccine-production schedule to counter a flu pandemic.\n",

            "WAITING FOR CHICKEN EGGS\n",
            "\n",
            "Each year, manufacturers including Sanofi, Novartis (VX: ), the Medimmune unit of AstraZeneca (L: ) and GSK make about 155 million doses of flu vaccine for the U.S. market alone, growing the virus in chicken eggs. Usually the doses, which protect against strains that experts predicted the previous February, are ready in time and in sufficient quantity.\n",
            "\n",
            "But if the strain that appears during flu season was not the one experts forecast, the vaccines might not work. The appearance of H1N1 swine flu in 2009-2010 took experts by surprise, and the flu was already on its second wave before a vaccine was ready; an estimated 61 million people in the U.S. got swine flu and 12,500 died.\n",
            "\n",
            "Failures such as that led the U.S. government to award $400 million in start-up funding to three Centres for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADMs) to boost biodefence and preparedness for pandemic flu.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"There's no way you can produce 50 million doses in 12 weeks\" with current production technology, said Giroir. \"But plant-based production could.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "While one chicken egg can produce one or two doses of flu vaccine, one tobacco plant can produce 50 at a fraction of the cost.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an arm of the Defense Department that funds cutting-edge research, is impressed enough with the potential of tobacco-plant production systems to have awarded multi-million-dollar grants to both Medicago and Caliber, and so far the support has paid off.\n",
            "\n",
            "In a 2012 DARPA challenge, Medicago, jointly owned by Philip Morris International (N: ) and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp , produced 10 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine in just a month in tobacco plants inside its sprawling North Carolina greenhouses. In animal tests, the experimental vaccine successfully triggered the production of protective antibodies against H1N1.\n",

            "All the company had to go on was part of the virus's genetic sequence. But while in egg-based production whole flu viruses are injected into the eggs, where they replicate and form the basis for the vaccine, all that's really needed to trigger immunity are the proteins that stud the virus's coat.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those proteins, called hemagglutinins, are what the immune system attacks. They can be produced by splicing the hemagglutinin gene into almost any kind of cell; Medicago uses harmless bacteria to carry the hemagglutinin genes into the tobacco plant leaves.\n",

            "Technicians at the greenhouses in North Carolina then soak 36-day-old Nicotiana benthamiana plants (cousins of those used for cigarettes) upside down in a liquid containing the Trojan Horse bacteria, explained chief scientist Marc-Andre D'Aoust. Through a process called vacuum infiltration, air is drawn out of the leaves and they suck up the bacteria.\n",

            "After growing in special chambers for a week, the leaf cells are churning out hemagglutinins. Extracted, purified, and combined with other bits of the virus, they form the basis for a vaccine.\n",

            "To succeed, the companies will have to persuade the U.S. Food and Drug Administration not only that the vaccine is safe and effective, as clinical trials are designed to show, but also that the hemagglutinin or other proteins can be extracted from the leaves cleanly and that the largely-untested manufacturing process yields a uniform, reliable product.\n",

AstraZeneca said it was disappointed, but noted this particular trial was unusual in using a low dose and combining Lynparza with a standard chemotherapy.

            "LONDON (Reuters) - As sterling plumbs the depths, foreign investors are withdrawing from British stocks and leaving domestic funds to push the benchmark bluechip index to record highs - for now.\n",
            "\n",
            "But some investors are growing nervous about how long the sterling-based funds, insulated from the pound's slide and drawn by healthy dividend yields, will continue to fill the gap.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FTSE 100's ( ) sharp recovery from lows after Britons voted to leave the European Union in June stands in stark contrast to a darkening outlook for the pound and the domestic economy.\n",

            "In sterling terms, London-listed stocks have raced to their highest ever levels even though investment funds have continued to bleed money, share valuations are near multi-year highs and the outlook for earnings remains muted.\n",

            "Data from Thomson Reuters Lipper shows that from June to September, UK-focused equity funds suffered outflows of more than 3 billion pounds.\n",
            "\n",
            "Much of this appears to have been pulled by investors based in dollars or euros. While the FTSE is up nine percent from the EU referendum day of June 23, the pound has lost 18 and 15 percent respectively against their home currencies - wiping out their notional gains.\n",
            "\n",
            "At its latest policy meeting, the Bank of England noted estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence suggesting that net purchases of FTSE 100 shares by non-residents in July and August were about half of the average monthly inflows last year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Still, the FTSE 100 rose 13 percent from June to September and is up by more than fifth since its lows in July following the shock referendum result.\n",

            "The composition of the UK index along with the kind of investors active in the market helps to shed some light on what is underpinning stocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dominated by large, dividend-paying, global companies - many of which receive a big earnings boost when they bring offshore revenues home thanks to the weak pound - the FTSE 100 hit the sweet spot in a world where yields on investments are scarce.\n",
            "\n",
            "With yields on British government bonds near rock-bottom, this is particularly the case for domestic investors for whom currency is less of a factor.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The UK remains an attractive place for investors seeking dividends; there are 15 companies with an indicative dividend yield of over five percent, which is significant when compared to the one percent yield on 10-year gilts,\" said Matthew Beesley, a portfolio manager and Head of Global Equities at Henderson Global Investors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Less than 10 percent of the roughly 600 UK-focused equity funds tracked by Lipper have enjoyed net inflows since June. Inflows are heavily skewed towards so-called income funds, which aim to pay their unit holders dividends, and tracker funds, which passively buy stocks in a given index.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nick Train's $3 billion UK equity fund, which had a fifth of the fund in shares of drinks group Diageo (L: ) and consumer goods giant Unilever (L: ) at the end of September, attracted the most inflows with more than $440 million.\n",

            "British fund supermarket Hargreaves Landsdown (L: ), which caters largely to domestic retail investors, on Thursday posted record profits and assets under management for its latest quarter, but said investors' confidence had fallen and this could weigh on future business.\n",
            "\n",
            "Equity income funds were in demand in a low interest rate environment, chief executive Ian Gorham told Reuters.\n",
            "\n",
            "The large dividend payers are also among the biggest listed firms in the UK and with the FTSE 100 weighted by market-capitalisation, the larger a firm the more influence its wields on the index's moves.\n",
            "\n",
            "Just 10 large stocks make up nearly half the market-cap of the FTSE 100. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the index, which overwhelmingly favour bigger stocks, are the only other group to have seen inflows since June.\n",
            "\n",
            "Oil majors BP (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) (L: ) and emerging markets-focused banks HSBC (L: ) and drugs group AstraZeneca (L: ), are all big outperformers and have been key in lifting the broader index.\n",
            "\n",
            "Eric Moore, a portfolio manager of the Miton UK Income fund who holds AstraZeneca shares, says the company is one among a handful that pays out dividends in appreciating U.S. dollars, making them even more attractive to British investors.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"It may be a one-off mechanical adjustment but right here, right now the impact is real. It's money in the bank,\" said Moore, who adds, however, that the sustainability of dividends are a concern as payouts have grown faster than a recovery in corporate profits.\n",

            "The view from across the Atlantic is less sanguine.\n",
            "\n",
            "Offshore investors are less enthusiastic about investing in UK assets due to the growing likelihood of a \"hard\" Brexit - in which Britain leaves the EU’s single market in order to impose controls on immigration, disrupting access to its main trading partner.\n",
            "\n",
            "More than half of UK stocks are held by overseas investors, according to the latest data from Britain's Office for National Statistics. Foreign holdings were less than 10 percent in the 1970s and 1980s, and stood at around 35 percent at the turn of the century.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cumberland Advisors, a Florida-based investment firm that uses mostly ETFs, points out that the main UK ETF used by U.S. investors, the iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF (P: ), has lost money this year. A currency-hedged version is up, though the fund's assets under management are considerably smaller.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bill Witherell, chief global economist at Cumberland Advisors, said a weaker pound is positive for UK multinational firms only as long as single-market access continues.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The prospect of a weaker domestic economy and heightened policy uncertainty lead us to maintain our maximum underweight of the UK in our International, Global, and Tactical Trend ETF Portfolios,\" said Witherell.\n",

            "The FTSE 100's climb above the 7,000 point level has taken valuations to 16 times forward earnings, close to the highest in a decade.\n",
            "\n",
            "It has brought back some uncomfortable memories. The three instances when the index was around these levels were just before the dotcom bust in 1999-2000, the collapse of the Northern Rock bank in 2007 and during last year's Greek debt crisis.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"After 20 years in the business, I can't help but feel a little jittery about the FTSE around here,\" said Moore.\n",

            "Since global Advair sales were $5.6 billion in 2015, with half that generated in the United States, the opportunity is significant. Still, Ward-Lilley argues there is more to Vectura than a big play on generics.\n",

The EMA currently approves treatments for all EU countries from its headquarters in London, where it employs a staff of nearly 900, making it the largest EU body in Britain. Health minister Jeremy Hunt said last week he expected those ties to be severed once Britain leaves the EU, fuelling fears that Britons might get slower access to new drugs than the rest of Europe, while companies would face extra regulatory hurdles.\n",

If you separate the two you could still decide to keep the same regulatory standards and as a result agree to recognise each others approvals,\" Soriot said.

            "Analysts said the results of the trial, known as PACIFIC, showed AstraZeneca was ahead of competitors as there was a gap in the market for such treatment.

            "They also said the efficacy of durvalumab in PACIFIC augured well for the results of a trial of the drug in a combination therapy, called MYSTIC. That is used on more advanced cancers, but before or instead of chemotherapy, and results are expected in June or July.\n",

            "Positively for those already holding its stock, Glaxo announced today that it would be revising its guidance for the full year “towards the upper end of previous expectations“. Thanks to bumper sales of Shingrix (likely to be £700m-£750m in the current financial year after bringing in £286m over Q3) and improved cost control, adjusted earnings per share growth of between 8%-10% at constant exchange rates is now predicted.

            "The real draw for many investors, however, remains Glaxo’s bumper yield. As expected, the company revealed a 19p per share dividend for the quarter. A total payout of 80p for the financial year was also reiterated — something that hasn’t changed since 2014.\n",
            "\n",
            "Based on its today’s share price, that leaves Glaxo yielding 5.2%. While I don’t expect significant hikes going forward, the extent to which these cash returns are likely to be covered by profits is beginning to look far healthier. I fully confess to being sceptical over the company’s ability to avoid taking a knife to its dividend over the last couple of years but, at £2.38bn, the 42% improvement in free cash flow over the year to date makes Glaxo’s income credentials a lot stronger.\n",
            "\n",
            "It might not be a screaming buy, but today’s numbers have led me to revise my view on the company. At a time when many investors are clamouring for security as a response to ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, to interest rate rises and our forthcoming EU departure, I think purchasing slices of non-cyclical, globally diversified businesses like Glaxo could be a sound move.\n",

            "For a start, the strong sales performance of its oncology drugs is a sign of its strategy in that field.

            "\n",
            "The company has also been making good headway in China, working with the government and local hospitals to gain a strong base for selling its drugs at fair prices, competing with generic alternatives. Mr Soriot did warn however that he expects sales in China to slow as changes in the way the country purchases drugs will make it more difficult for some of Astra’s medicines to maintain a foothold.\n",
            "\n",
            "With this in mind, the main area impacting the share price going forward may not in fact be the underlying strength of the company, but rather market expectations. When companies put in such good performance, investors begin to expect greater and greater things.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is strange, perhaps, that strong financial numbers are in and of themselves not considered good by investors, unless they are better than the ‘expected’ figures given by a particular analyst or talking head (company guidance itself is usually kept realistic to avoid large share movements).\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, this is because the stock will already be factoring in the expected numbers, but it still seems strange that a company with growing profits will see its share price hit. Unfortunately for AstraZeneca, I expect this may be a trap it falls into.\n",
            "\n",
            "Its share price is not cheap, and though over the long term it seems to be a strong investment, any investors looking to get out in the next year or two may see more volatility. As a long-term Buy however, I still think Astra will see its share price climb.\n",

International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON: ), the parent of British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it’s cutting its medium-term target for earnings per share growth to at least 10% from at least 12% previously. That reflects a reduced forecast for capacity growth: the group now sees available seat-kilometers rising only 3.4% a year through 2023 from a previous estimate of 6%. It’s also changing the way it reports capital expenditure, stripping out any proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. As such, the new, ‘gross’ annual capex requirement is seen at an average of 4.7 billion euros ($5.2 billion), whereas the old ‘net’ capex spend had been estimated at 2.6 billion euros. The estimate for levered free cash flow remained the same at 2.1 billion euros a year, while leverage is still to be contained at or below 1.8 times EBITDA. Pharma group AstraZeneca (LON: ) reported successful Phase III trials for its roxadustat drug, used to treat anemia in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease.

            "\n",
            "As far as the new decade has gone so far, it’s not off to a great start. We entered 2020 on after a resounding election victory that meant Brexit uncertainty might soon end. The was also performing well, and the economy didn’t look close to a recession.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Covid-19 pandemic quickly changed all of the above, and the FTSE 100 index is down around 25% year to date. But a decade is a long time, and we’re less than half a year into it. So for stock investors looking at the long term, below are my top three strategies for the decade.\n",
            "\n",
            "Buy defensive Without wishing to start off overly gloomy, my first idea would be to buy defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are those that perform well during a downturn. This is usually due to the products/services offered being a necessity for consumers and being bought regardless of the economic performance. Good examples of this are supermarkets such as J Sainsbury (OTC: ), and healthcare firms such as Astrazeneca (LON: ).\n",
            "\n",
            "My rationale for this long-term play is that we recently ended the longest stock market bull run in history. So it may take a few years to get up to the speed of gains we saw in the past few years. We may recover most of the losses from the pandemic in the next year, but having this cautious tilt to your stock portfolio will definitely help you to sleep easier.\n",
            "\n",
            "Buy high growth The ‘exciting’ firms of today can often be the stalwarts of tomorrow. Now obviously, if you knew that certain growing firms would be profitable buys, you’d simply buy them all. But you can never know that and high-growth firms are riskier to invest in. In order to counterbalance this risk, mix your investments into half a dozen growth firms. This means that even if some fail to really break through in the decade, having one that does (and doubles the share price) more than makes up for it.\n",
            "\n",
            "As examples, take a look at the story and growth behind Ocado (LON: ), Flutter Entertainment and Games Workshop (actually a firm). I wrote more about the merits of high-growth businesses here, and how they can aid early retirement.\n",
            "\n",
            "Buy safe dividend stocks Until recently, most FTSE 100 firms were paying dividends, and exceptionally few had the need to cut them. Yet due to the pandemic, even income-paying stalwarts such as ITV (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) have slashed them.\n",
            "\n",
            "For some firms, it will take a while before the board has enough confidence to resume paying dividends. So when looking at the next decade, it’s important to buy safe dividends wherever possible. Adding stocks that pay out dividends is vital to support your other strategies.\n",
            "\n",
            "High-growth firms usually look to reinvest profits to support further expansion, and defensive stocks usually don’t offer high dividend yields. So seeking income is wise to support the other two ideas.\n",
            "\n",

            "Antibodies are proteins that kill the virus itself. T-cells, meanwhile, can also kill the cells it has infected, greatly strengthening the body’s response to viral infections.

In terms of products, Venomil, Acarovac Plus, Pollinex and Pollinex Quattro were the top performers – driving net sales growth of 8% to £73.7m in 2019. The operating margin for the last 12 months is around 12%. That’s lower than GSK (18.5%) but higher than Astrazeneca (10%). Obviously, comparing Allergy Therapeutics to the giants isn’t meaningful; its market cap is 1,000 times lower at just £89m, but it does give us a good comparison for a healthy margin in the pharmaceutical industry.\n",

Could Allergy Therapeutics capitalise on that potential growth with their products currently in the pipeline? It’s certainly possible.\n",

            "Key drivers So, what are the risks, if you’re thinking of investing money in Allergy Therapeutics? Over the next two years, the company will be running several important clinical trials. These have binary outcomes – either success or failure. The company’s long-standing operations will mitigate this risk to some extent. A second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic would also like have a big impact on forecasts.\n",

            "It all began in July when the British government announced it was seeking lots of volunteers for large-scale clinical trials of new vaccines. Only a month before, a good friend of mine here had died of COVID-19 after spending weeks on a ventilator.\n",
            "\n",
            "Curious, I completed an online form, figuring I wasn't committing myself to anything.\n",
            "\n",
            "In late September, an email informed me that I was among more than 250,000 \"pioneers in the fight against COVID-19\" who had enlisted in the cause. On Oct. 1, I was invited to apply for a trial of a vaccine made by an American biotech company called Novavax Inc (O: ). It was seeking at the time up to 10,000 volunteers in the United Kingdom for a late-stage trial to determine the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"If you are aged 18-84 and in good health, you could be eligible to participate,\" the email stated. \"The study involves six visits over a period of around 13 months. Reasonable travel expenses will be reimbursed.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, it was time to decide. I began researching the Novavax vaccine, which has received less attention than several others. On Monday, Pfizer Inc (N: ) announced its COVID-19 vaccine candidate appeared to be more than 90% effective. In September, late-stage trials of a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) were halted after a report of a serious neurological illness in a volunteer, although the trials later were permitted to resume.\n",
            "\n",
            "To me, the Novavax vaccine seemed less risky. Although the Maryland-based company has never received approval for a vaccine, it's employing the same technology to create its COVID-19 candidate that it used with a promising flu shot. I've gotten inoculated against the flu every year for decades and never once had an adverse reaction.\n",
            "\n",
            "The published results of the first phase of testing the Novavax vaccine also showed no serious side effects among more than 100 participants who were injected with it. The worst case was someone who had a mild fever for a day.\n",
            "\n",
            "I decided to go for it. I figured if life is ever going to return to normal, the world is going to need vaccines and volunteers to see if they work. On a selfish level, I liked the idea of getting inoculated as soon as possible, given how monotonous – and sometimes scary – my daily routine had become. I've become so risk-averse that my wife has called me her \"jailer.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Another attraction: If I were to catch the virus, the researchers would carefully monitor me. In the UK, where there has been a surge in new COVID-19 cases to more than 20,000 a day, infected people essentially are on their own unless they require emergency care.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, there was a 50-50 chance I would be injected with a placebo – a saline solution – that wouldn't protect me against anything. In testing vaccines, placebos are used as a control to see whether the real thing is more effective at fending off the virus.\n",
            "\n",
            "And so, after an online and over-the-phone screening to determine if I had any medical conditions that disqualified me from the study, I was given an appointment for the first of two injections.\n",
            "\n",
            "I showed up one recent morning at the clinical research facility at King's College Hospital in south London – a small, drab building that is part of a sprawling medical complex. To my surprise, the receptionist asked me to take off my \"Churchill Pro\" bike mask – which costs $33 and uses \"British Military Filtration Technology\" to block \"almost 100%\" of viruses – and replace it with a cheap, disposable one. I later learned this was because my super-duper mask potentially could be contaminated.\n",
            "\n",
            "Several other volunteers were already in a large room getting set up. I met privately with a doctor who asked if I had any questions. I had a few: \"What if the Novavax vaccine proved so successful that the trial was stopped? Would I be told whether I received the placebo and, if so, be given the real vaccine?\" The doctor told me that if I had gotten the placebo, I would have to wait a year, since the researchers would want to keep monitoring every trial participant. Not what I wanted to hear.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"What if another vaccine is approved first and I was given the placebo? Would I be allowed to take that?\" The doctor suggested that was possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "After I signed a consent form to participate in the trial, she gave me a brief physical exam. Back in the large room, a nurse gave me a COVID-19 test, sticking a long swab up my throat and then through a nostril. Then he prepared to draw my blood. I warned him my veins were thin and often proved problematic. He proceeded to fail twice before calling over a colleague who had better luck.\n",
            "\n",
            "The injection itself was uneventful. But when the nurse checked my blood pressure afterward, it had spiked. He asked me to wait a few minutes and basically calm down.

            "\n",
            "So far, I've experienced no side effects and am awaiting a second injection once three weeks have passed. Curious about my experience, I spoke to James Galloway, a senior clinical lecturer at King's College who is the doctor responsible for my trial.\n",
            "\n",
            "He told me that no decisions have been made on what to do with volunteers who received the placebo if Novavax is shown to be effective or another vaccine is approved first.

Given that the cost of servicing its sizable debt pile has come down sharply since then (allowing a higher stock valuation, all other things being equal), you can even argue that the market is already applying a discount to the shares for the whole Covid-19 saga.\n",

Once this vaccine is administered, the mRNA instructs cells in the body to create a piece of spike protein that is part of the virus it aims to defeat. The immune system then sees it, identifies it as a foreign invader, and is therefore prepared to defend itself when the actual virus hits by creating antibodies. Scientists have experimented with this technology for years, but not a single vaccine made it to the market- until now. These two companies joined forces and made a prophetic bet in this novel avenue to antibody creation. They ended up delivering extraordinary results in a stunning amount of time.\n",

But, this is actually a ‘good thing' as Paul Offit, professor of pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, explained to CNN on Wednesday. Such side effects show that the immune response is actually working. Therefore, the flu-like side effects are actually a good sign that the vaccine is doing its job.

Therefore, despite a late start, its vaccine might still win the race due to pricing and convenience. Its one-dose trial preliminarily reported favorable safety and efficacy data in early October, so it is reasonable to expect another update before the end of the year. If it remains on track, it could be distributed to the public at the beginning of next year. Its vaccine will be stable for three months without requiring South Pole-like temperatures as a refrigerator will do just fine. The cost per dose will be around $10, which also makes it much less expensive than Moderna's $32 or Pfizer's $19.50, although AstraZeneca is leading that race by planning to charge around $3 per dose.

            "(Montreal, Quebec - 7. Dezember 2020) Osisko Metals Inc. (das \"Unternehmen\" oder \"Osisko Metals\") (TSX-V: OM; OTCQX: OMZNF; FRANKFURT: 0B51) freut sich, die Ergebnisse des abgeschlossenen Herbstbohrprogramms auf dem zu 100 % unternehmenseigenen Pine Point Project, NWT, bekannt zu geben. Die Untersuchungsergebnisse wurden von fünfzehn (15) Explorationslöchern in der Zentralzone erhalten, die sowohl Schwerkraftgradiometrie-Anomalien als auch Gebiete mit nicht eingeschränkter Mineralisierung um das aktuelle Ressourcenblockmodell herum erprobt haben.- Bohrloch OM100-20-001 durchteufte 8,60 Meter mit einem Gehalt von 11,45% Zn und 3,57% Pb im nördlichen Teil der Lagerstätte L65, um die Ergebnisse eines historischen Bohrlochs zu bestätigen. Die Ergebnisse bestätigen eine gut entwickelte tabellarische Mineralisierung an diesem Standort, die Teil der aktuellen untertägigen Mineralressource der Zentralzone ist. Weitere Bohrungen werden darauf abzielen, die in diesem unmittelbaren Bereich vorhandene Mineralisierung zu erweitern und mit einem 900 Meter langen offenen Trend parallel zum Hauptteil der tafelförmigen Lagerstätte L65 und nördlich davon zu verbinden.- Bohrloch OM97-20-001 durchteufte 3,00 Meter mit einem Gehalt von 2,01% Zn und 2,94% Pb in einer oberflächennahen tafelförmigen Mineralisierung, die sich 1.300 Meter westlich der historischen Lagerstätte K77 befindet, in einem Gebiet, für das für die meisten historischen Bohrlöcher keine Untersuchungsergebnisse vorliegen. Dieses Bohrloch weist auf das Potenzial hin, die Mineralisierung in Richtung der zuvor abgebauten Lagerstätte K77 zu erweitern (historische Produktion (Cominco): 0,5 Mio. t mit einem Gehalt von 12,8 % Pb+Zn).- Eine neue Anomalie der induzierten Polarisation deutet auf eine prismatische Mineralisierung hin. Eine vor kurzem abgeschlossene geophysikalische IP-Untersuchung (Induced Polarization) hat ein eindeutiges Ziel für die Wiederaufladbarkeit und den spezifischen Widerstand zwischen dem Haupt- und dem Nordtrend identifiziert, das 250 Meter lang und 150 Meter breit ist und sich von der Oberfläche bis in eine Tiefe von etwa 200 Metern erstreckt. Es gibt keine früheren Bohrungen in diesem Ziel. Es weist ähnliche Merkmale wie frühere IP-Untersuchungen auf bekannten prismatischen Lagerstätten auf, die höher gradig sind als tafelförmige Lagerstätten. Bohrloch OM103-20-001, ein stratigrafisches Bohrloch, das 260 Meter südlich der IP-Anomalie gebohrt wurde (bevor die Untersuchung abgeschlossen war), durchteufte eine starke dolomitische Alteration in der Schlüsselformation Sulphur Point, die der primäre Wirt der gesamten Mineralisierung bei Pine Point ist.Robert Wares, Vorsitzender und CEO, kommentierte dazu: \"Die bisher im Rahmen dieses Programms erzielten Ergebnisse, die in den letzten drei Pressemitteilungen veröffentlicht wurden, weisen eindeutig auf das hervorragende Potenzial für eine Erweiterung der tafelförmigen Mineralisierung bei Pine Point hin. Außerdem weisen mehrere ungetestete geophysikalische Anomalien, einschließlich der oben beschriebenen starken IP-Anomalie, auf das Potenzial für neue Entdeckungen hochgradiger prismatischer Lagerstätten hin. Das Projekt Pine Point schreitet an allen Fronten sehr gut voran, was unserer Meinung nach der Beginn eines anhaltend steigenden Zinkrohstoffmarktes ist. Wir freuen uns auf eine weitere erfolgreiche Explorationssaison in Pine Point im neuen Jahr\".Die Ergebnisse für alle Bohrlöcher sind in Tabelle 1 aufgeführt. Das Bohrloch OM100-20-002 begrenzte die Mineralisierung in einem Ausreißerabschnitt des Mineralressourcenblocks L65 nordöstlich von OM100-20-001. Bohrloch OM101-20-001 beschränkte ebenfalls Mineralressourcen am Rande der vorgeschlagenen Grube K68. Alle übrigen Bohrlöcher erprobten verschiedene Gravitationsreaktionen mit Zielen, die aus vorhandenen Daten zusammengestellt wurden.Die tatsächliche Breite wird auf 95-100% der gemeldeten Bohrbreiten geschätzt.Robin Adair ist die qualifizierte Person und der Vizepräsident Exploration für Osisko Metals Inc. Er ist für die in dieser Pressemitteilung gemeldeten technischen Daten verantwortlich und ist ein in den North West Territories registrierter professioneller Geologe.Osisko Metals hält sich an ein strenges Qualitätssicherungs- und Qualitätskontrollprogramm in Bezug auf Kernhandhabung, Probenahme, Probentransport und Laboranalysen. Bohrkernproben aus dem Projektgebiet Pine Point wurden sicher zu seiner Kernanlage am Projektstandort Pine Point in den Northwest Territories transportiert, wo sie protokolliert und beprobt wurden. Die für die Untersuchung ausgewählten Proben wurden über einen sicheren Transport zur Aufbereitungsanlage von ALS Canada Ltd. in Yellowknife transportiert. Die Zellstoffe wurden in der Anlage von ALS Canada Ltd. in North Vancouver, British Columbia, analysiert. Alle Proben werden durch vier Säureaufschlüsse analysiert, gefolgt von sowohl ICP-AES als auch ICP-MS für den Ultra-Trace-Level-Nachweis für eine Multi-Element-Suite mit einer oberen Nachweisgrenze von 1% für unedle Metalle. Proben, die über 1 % für Zn und 1 % für Pb aufweisen, werden durch Säureaufschluss mit vier Säuren und ICP-AES-Analyse mit einer oberen Nachweisgrenze von 30 % bzw. 20 % analysiert. Proben, die Zn >30% und/oder Pb >20% aufweisen, werden durch traditionelle Titration analysiert. Das aktuelle Bohrprogramm folgt strengen COVID-19-Protokollen, lief seit dem 30. August und ist nun abgeschlossen. Weitere Ergebnisse stehen noch aus.Osisko Metals Inc. ist ein kanadisches Explorations- und Erschließungsunternehmen, das im Bereich der Grundmetalle Werte schafft. Das Unternehmen kontrolliert zwei von Kanadas führenden ehemaligen Zinkabbaulagern: 1) das Projekt Pine Point in den Northwest Territories, für das die vor kurzem eingereichte PEA einen Nettogegenwartswert nach Steuern von $ 500 Mio. und einen IRR von 29,6 % angegeben hat. Die PEA des Pine Point-Projekts basiert auf aktuellen Mineralressourcenschätzungen, die für den Tagebau und flachen Untertagebau geeignet sind und aus 12,9 Mio. Tonnen mit einem Gehalt von 6,29% ZnEq an angezeigten Mineralressourcen und 37,6 Mio. Tonnen mit einem Gehalt von 6,80% ZnEq an abgeleiteten Mineralressourcen bestehen. Bitte beachten Sie den technischen Bericht mit dem Titel \"Preliminary Economic Assessment, Pine Point Project, Hay River, North West Territories, Canada\" vom 30. Juli, der auf SEDAR veröffentlicht wurde. Das Pine Point Projekt befindet sich am Südufer des Great Slave Lake in den Northwest Territories, in der Nähe der Infrastruktur, einem geteerten Autobahnzugang und verfügt bereits über 100 Kilometer brauchbare Transportstraßen. 2) Die Projekte des Bathurst Mining Camp befinden sich im Norden von New Brunswick. Das Unternehmen hat den Großteil seiner Beteiligung am Bathurst Mining Camp an Brunswick Exploration optioniert, wobei die Genehmigung der Transaktion durch die TSXV noch aussteht.Die in dieser Pressemitteilung erwähnten aktuellen Mineralressourcen entsprechen den NI43-101-Standards und wurden von unabhängigen qualifizierten Personen gemäß den NI43-101-Richtlinien erstellt. Bei den oben genannten Mineralressourcen handelt es sich nicht um Mineralreserven, da sie keine wirtschaftliche Rentabilität nachgewiesen haben. Die Menge und der Gehalt der gemeldeten abgeleiteten Mineralressourcen sind konzeptioneller Natur und werden auf der Grundlage begrenzter geologischer Beweise und Probentnahmen geschätzt. Geologische Beweise reichen aus, um den geologischen Gehalt und/oder die Qualität der Kontinuität anzudeuten, aber nicht zu überprüfen. Die Prozentsätze der Zink-Äquivalenz werden anhand der Metallpreise, der prognostizierten Metallausbeuten, der Konzentratgehalte, der Transportkosten, der von der Schmelze zu zahlenden Metalle und der Gebühren berechnet (siehe entsprechende technische Berichte für Details).Robert Wares, CEOE-Mail: info@osiskometals.comwww.osiskometals.com-In Europa:Swiss Resource Capital AGJochen Staigerinfo@resource-capital.chwww.resource-capital.chWarnhinweis zu zukunftsgerichteten Informationen: Diese Pressemitteilung enthält \"zukunftsgerichtete Informationen\" im Sinne der geltenden kanadischen Wertpapiergesetzgebung, die auf Erwartungen, Schätzungen und Prognosen zum Zeitpunkt dieser Pressemitteilung basieren.

It may be coming back to the minds of investors reading headlines about the vaccine developed by Pfizer (NYSE: ) and BioNTech (NASDAQ: ) this morning.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sky News reported that two British healthcare professionals who received the jab earlier this week suffered allergic reactions to it. The U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is now advising that “people who have a history of ‘significant’ allergic reactions should not currently receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine,” according to Sky News.\n",

            "Over 20% of the U.K. population, and almost half the adult population, suffers from one or more chronic allergy, according to various studies referenced by the charity Allergy U.K. That is a number big enough to have a nationwide impact on the take-up rate for the Pfizer drug.\n",

            "Moreover, the emergence of such problems comes against the backdrop of suspicions that the U.K. may have rushed through authorization of the drug for political advantage. They are not limited to a lunatic fringe of anti-vaxxers, either: the U.S.’s top doctor Anthony Fauci voiced such concerns initially before subsequently retracting them. Various U.K. government ministers put the speed of authorization in the U.K. down to its new freedom from EU bureaucracy, although MHRA head June Raine rather undermined the claims by noting that the U.K. was still subject to EU regulation and that it had merely made use of a provision in existing EU law.\n",

The world-leading liquid biopsy company noted that the study used blood from healthy volunteers spiked with cancer cells from five breast cancer cell lines and one lung cancer cell line to evaluate the linearity, sensitivity, and specificity of the Parsortix system in combination with three downstream techniques for the molecular characterisation of CTCs. The Parsortix system demonstrated strong linearity suggesting that a patient sample would reflect the frequency of CTCs in the patient's blood. Furthermore, the system was shown to be capable of isolating a single CTC spiked into 5mL of blood.

Innate licensed the US and EU rights to AstraZeneca's FDA-approved Lumoxiti for certain patients with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia in October 2018.\n",

            "\"Since in-licensing Lumoxiti from AstraZeneca, we have been committed to delivering this medicine to patients and healthcare professionals in the US, and moving towards commercialization in the EU. However, we've determined that there is low strategic value for us in maintaining Lumoxiti in our portfolio due to lower than anticipated product sales, further compounded by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This has led us to make the decision to re-prioritize our investments in our R&D portfolio,\" said Mondher Mahjoubi, Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. \"We will continue to embed a commercial mindset into our R&D programs, which is a key success factor for the development and future commercialization of our pipeline assets.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "As part of this decision, Innate will immediately begin to reduce its US commercial operations; however, it will maintain the appropriate patient and customer support services, as well as product supply, during this transition period. In the EU, Innate will no longer progress Lumoxiti regulatory or commercial activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The accounting impacts will be presented in the December 31, 2020 financial statements. As a reminder, the net book value of Lumoxiti intangible assets amounted to €45.2 million, as of June 30, 2020.\n",

            "Lumoxiti is a CD22-directed immunotoxin and a first-in-class treatment in the US for adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a purine nucleoside analog. Lumoxiti is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 29 mL/min). It comprises the CD22 binding portion of an antibody fused to a truncated pseudomonas exotoxin. The toxin inhibits protein synthesis and ultimately triggers apoptotic cell death. Lumoxiti received U.S. FDA approval in September 2018 and has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of r/r HCL. AstraZeneca is the marketing authorization applicant for the EU filing.\n",

            "“This suggests the extensions of the furlough scheme (firstly to the end of November and then to the end of March) started to have some limiting impact on job losses. The labour market was also likely helped by the economy’s bounce back in the third quarter when GDP rebounded 15.5% quarter-on-quarter after the 19.8% quarter-on-quarter second-quarter contraction,” Archer said.\n",
            "\n",

            "“The EY ITEM Club predicts that the unemployment rate could rise to 7.0% during the first half of 2021, although the peak is both lower and later than had been expected before the furlough scheme was extended to the end of March. There is still the chance that there could be appreciable job losses when the furlough scheme ends in March, particularly if the economy is still being affected by some COVID-19-related restrictions.\n",

        "None of the scores were particularly outstanding and further improvements might include updating the lexicon with words and sentiments from other more specialised sources such as the [Loughran-McDonald Financial Sentiment Word Lists](https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/#LM%20Sentiment%20Word%20Lists). This would likely result in more accurate sentiment analysis as it was specifically built for financial text whereas VADER is more attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.\n"
