Reliance, for long the darling of Indian investors, was briefly knocked off its four-year long perch as the country's most-valuable company in August -- first by state-run Coal India and then by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp -- before regaining it. TCS, part of the salt-to-software Tata conglomerate, is the first private-sector company to overtake Reliance in market value. Shares in Reliance, which owns the world's largest refinery complex, fell 2.7% on Friday to their lowest level since March 2009. The stock lost 34.5% in 2011, underperforming a 24.6% fall in the benchmark index. At Friday's close, Reliance was valued at about USD 42.7 billion, while TCS commanded a market value of USD 42.8 billion, despite its shares closing 0.4% lower. &amp;quot;This leadership game is becoming like a musical chair,&amp;quot; said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research at SMC Global securities in New Delhi. &amp;quot;If the underperformance in Reliance shares continues, it will become difficult for them to regain the top position again.&amp;quot; Reliance's growth outlook has been marred by falling gas output from its huge KG D6 gas fields, off India's east coast, which has drawn criticism from the country's upstream regulator, investors and analysts. A USD 7.2 billion deal to sell a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks to BP Plc struck earlier this year failed to impress shareholders, who are also looking for more clarity on the company's move to enter new areas such as retail and telecoms. &amp;quot;KG D6 has sort of become a drag,&amp;quot; Thunuguntla said. &amp;quot;And also, they have somehow got into a long-gestation trap in all their businesses -- be it oil and gas, retail or telecom.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They are sitting on a huge cash pile and need to deploy it at the right place. Holding cash is again not good,&amp;quot; he said. TCS, which competes with companies such as Infosys Ltd and Wipro in providing software services to western clients, saw its share price jump nearly 12% in the December quarter, compared with a 6% drop in the benchmark index. TCS has shed 0.4% on the year. Global technology spending outlook remains uncertain with no easy fix seen to the euro zone sovereign debt crisis and concerns about the US economy, but a sharp fall in the Indian rupee helps these exporters who get most of their revenues in foreign currencies while bulk of their spends are in rupee."

As the share price of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) fell by 2.81% to a multi-year low of Rs 692.90 today, the company's market valuation slipped to Rs 2,26,886 crore -- a shade below Tata Consultancy Services' Rs 2,27,282 crore.  Consequently, RIL lost its long-held position (except for a brief period in August this year) of the country's largest company in terms of market valuation. In comparison to RIL's performance, TCS shares today ended with a modest loss of 0.35% at Rs 1161.25 and were earlier seen trading with a modest gain for most part of the trading session -- incidentally the last for 2011.  The performance of TCS stock was also a shade better than the barometer index Sensex, which fell by 0.57%. Earlier this month, RIL had also lost its position of the most influential stock in the Indian market to another IT giant Infosys.  RIL had been briefly dethroned from its position of the country's most valued company twice in August -- first to Coal India Ltd and then to another state-run firm ONGC. RIL's market value slipped below that of TCS for the first time at around 2 pm this afternoon and the country's biggest software exporter managed to retain the lead at the end of the trading session.  RIL has been among the best stocks to own in India for many years, but it continued to under-perform the overall market for most part of 2011, which has as such turned out to be a bad year for the stocks."

The entire Ambani family, including Mukesh and Anil, has been here together for the last two days to inaugurate a memorial for Dhirubhai Ambani, the legendary industrialist and founder of Reliance Group. The Chorwad house where Dhirubhai lived before leaving for Eden (now Yemen), has been transformed into a memorial, which was inaugurated by by the Ambanis' family guru Ramesh Oza (Bhaiji) in the presence of Kokilaben Ambani, her two sons and two daughters and other family members. A few years after Dhirubhai's death in July 2002, the two brothers had parted ways and formally split the business empire in 2006 after months of bitter rivalry and public spat. After the split, Mukesh took control of flagship Reliance Industries with interests in mostly energy and textiles businesses, while the younger sibling Anil got telecom, power, entertainment and financial services among others. The family reunion in Chorwad, in Junagarh district of Gujarat, took place after more than a year after the two brothers agreed in May 2010 to end their disputes and work together for an environment of harmony, cooperation and collaboration between their groups. Soon after arriving here on December 26, family matriarch Kokilaben had said that the two industrialist brothers had no differences between them and they are together now. &amp;quot;There are no differences or ill-feelings between Mukesh and Anil. Both the brothers will come to Chorwad with their families tomorrow (December 27)... This is our family function and entire family will be present at the function,&amp;quot; Kokilaben had said. Asked about the reported discord between Mukesh and Anil, Kokilaben had said: &amp;quot;There is love between the two brothers. That is why, they are coming together.&amp;quot; The family had last time congregated in Chorwad about 15 years ago in 1996, when a grand feast was organised for the villagers in the presence of Dhirubhai. Talking to mediapersons, Group President of Reliance Industries, Parimal Nathwani told reporters today that the Ambani family took part in a 'havan' (ritual) yesterday and the reunion culminated with 'raas-garbha' (dance) played at the Chorwadi temple premises. &amp;quot;This was completely a family function and therefore no friends were invited,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;The entire Ambani family got emotional at the inauguration of the memorial, which is nothing less than a Bharat Ratna type of fitting tribute to the patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani,&amp;quot; he added. He said it was significant that a memorial in his name came up at a place, from where Dhirubhai began his career as a young entrepreneur, while noting that a memorial in the name of an industrialist is unheard in this part of country. &amp;quot;The spiritual guru Ramesh Oza will also deliver a one hour discourse, which shall be attended by the Ambani family,&amp;quot; he said. The memorial is the same place where Dhirubhai spent his childhood. A rented section of the bungalow, then called 'Mangarolwalo Delo', was the place where he lived. Dhirubhai had later purchased the bungalow in 2002 which is now renamed as 'Dhirubhaino Delo'. The memorial has three sections - a picture gallery, the old residence of Dhirubhai and an auditorium. The sepia gallery depicts Dhirubhai's journey as captured by pictures, while his old dwelling is arranged the way it was and the auditorium is for screening a short film on his life. The two groups run by Mukesh and Anil command market value of Rs 243,300 crore and Rs 51,300 crore respectively. While the Mukesh-led group has two listed companies, Anil's group has six listed entities. The companies from both the groups saw their share prices declining in an overall weak market today. While Mukesh-led RIL dropped 1.95 per cent, another group company RIIL was down 2.5 per cent. From the Anil-led companies, RCom slipped 1.44 per cent, Reliance Capital fell 2.1 per cent, Reliance Infra was down 2.8 per cent, Reliance Power shed 0.42 per cent, Reliance Mediaworks was down 3.9 per cent and Reliance Broadcast Network declined by 3.3 per cent on the bourses. Earlier in the day, Anil visited the famous Somnath temple near Veraval. Anil, who had reached Somnath in a helicopter, performed pooja of the jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva before leaving for Chorwad."

Natural gas production from the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields and the MA oilfield in the KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6, block in the Krishna-Godavari Basin of the Bay of Bengal stood at 39.80 mmscmd in the week ended December 4, according to a status report filed by the company with the Oil Ministry here. The output comprised 32.94 mmscmd from the D1 and D3 gas fields and 6.86 mmscmd from the MA oilfield. The KG-D6 production is lower than 61.5 mmscmd rate achieved in March, 2010, as a drop in pressure in the wells and increased water ingress has led to a lower per-well gas output. The report said of the 18 wells drilled, completed and put on production in the D1 and D3 fields, four wells -- A2, B1, B2 and B13 -- had to be shut or closed due to high water cut/sanding issues.

While Reliance holds 60% interest in KG-D6, UK's BP Plc holds 30% and Niko Resources of Canada the remaining 10%. Reliance started natural gas production from the KG-D6 fields in April 1, 2009, with output of about 40 mmscmd.The MA oilfield currently produces about 12,715 barrels of crude oil per day. In addition, 1,831 barrels of condensate are produced from the field every day. The report said 14.89 mmscmd of the gas output is being sold to fertiliser plants and 22.02 mmscmd to power plants. The remaining 2.89 mmscmd is consumed by other sectors, including those fed by the East-West pipeline that transports gas from the East Coast to consumption centres in the West. Reliance had projected an output of 39.50 mmscmd of gas during December. As per the status report, out of the 22 wells planned in in Phase-I of D1 and D3 field development, 18 wells have been drilled and completed so far. Of these, 14 wells were put on production, while four wells were kept closed due to high water cut and sanding issues. "

It may be true but there are 50% observers who are not fully convinced with the reasoning,&amp;quot; the source said. RIL was to drill 22 wells on the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in KG-D6 block by March 31, 2011 and 31 wells by March 31, 2012, as per the 2006 field development plan. But the Mukesh Ambani-run firm drilled only 20 wells till now, of which it has not put two of the wells on production yet. The source said failure of RIL to comply with its commitments made the oil ministry seek legal opinion. The SGI in its opinion quoted Section 3.2 of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) that states, &amp;quot;... amounts paid with respect to non-fulfilment of contractual obligations&amp;quot; can be disallowed for cost recovery. &amp;quot;...the expenditure incurred which has resulted in excess capacity / underutilisation of asset created on account of failure of the contractor (RIL) to adhere to the field development plan would fall within the provisions of Section 3.2,&amp;quot; SGI said. RIL has built facilities at KG-D6 to handle 80 million standard cubic meters per day of gas output which was expected by April 2012 but production currently is just 40.6 mmsmcd. &amp;quot;Excuse of geological uncertainty (for not drilling committed wells) does not wash with everyone,&amp;quot; the source said adding as the ministry contemplated next move, RIL slapped an arbitration notice challenging the proposed move to disallow a part of USD 5.7 billion expenditure already made in KG-D6 by restricting cost recovery in proportion to production. PSC for KG-D6, where drop in pressure in the wells and an increased water ingress lead to lower per-well gas output and halt in drilling pending more studies, allows operators to recover 100% of expenditure on exploration and production before sharing profits from the field with the government. It does not link cost-recovery to output. RIL and its new partner BP Plc of UK say new wells in KG-D6 can come up not before 2014. Incidentally, 2014 is also the year when the current USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit gas price for the block comes up for review. Production from KG-D6 field had reached 61.5 mmscmd in March 2010. However, from December 2010, the production started declining. The government had in 2006 approved an investment of USD 8.8 billion in two phases in developing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block (Phase-I: USD 5.2 billion and Phase-II USD 3.6 billion).

Raghavendran, the company's president of refinery business, said on Saturday. Reliance, which owns the world's biggest refining complex with total combined capacity of 1.24 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil, currently directly sells products into East Africa through its marketing firm Gapco. &amp;quot;Volumes going into Africa are far lower than the potential. Once African product specification comes up to Indian levels and global levels there will be a lot more potential,&amp;quot; Raghavendran said. Asked if Reliance is looking at expanding Gapco's operations on the continent, he said: &amp;quot;We are looking at opportunities and wherever there is some potential and it's economically justified we are looking at those.&amp;quot; Reliance currently exports most of the fuels from its giant complex as India does not compensate private refiners for selling fuels such as diesel and kerosene at subsidised rates mandated by the government. Gasoline prices were liberalised in June 2010. Its major markets are the United States, Europe, Latin America and Asia. Reliance is currently operating 600 fuel stations, mainly in western and southern India, out of the 1,400 it has in the country. Raghavendran said the company would not expand its local retail operations unless it gets a level playing field. &amp;quot;The world has to be the same for everyone,&amp;quot; he said. "

You may find companies like IndusInd Bank, Glenmark Pharma which probably I think goes well at this point of time in the business.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I think some of the infrastructure companies which are in the asset ownership space like Mundra Port.

Reliance, the largest listed Indian conglomerate, has hired Citigroup, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and UBS AG for the issue, according to the sources who declined to be named as the information is not public yet. Two other global banks are also likely to join the list of bankers for the issue, one of the sources said. The terms of bond have not yet been decided, the sources said. A Mumbai-based spokesman for Reliance Industries, which the market values at nearly &amp;amp;#36;49 billion, had no comment when reached by Reuters. All the three banks also declined to comment. The Economic Times newspaper reported on Wednesday Reliance planned to raise funds with an interest rate of 2.25-2.50 percent, about 125-150 basis points above the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The sources said Reliance would use the funds to boost operations at its two refineries in western Gujarat state, which account for about a third of India's refining capacity, and for possible acquisition of overseas energy assets. Part of the proceeds could also be used to repay some existing debt, one of the sources said. Reliance, controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, the country's richest man with reported wealth of &amp;amp;#36;22.6 billion, has interests in refining, oil and gas exploration, petrochemicals and retail. The company has been looking to expand into telecom and financial services. Reliance raised &amp;amp;#36;1.5 billion in bonds in October last year in a two-part deal - a &amp;amp;#36;1 billion 10-year tranche and another &amp;amp;#36;500 million, 30-year bond issue. It also completed a &amp;amp;#36;1.091 billion, five-year term loan from foreign investors in August, its third syndicated facility in nine months. Shares in Reliance, which has the highest weighting in the benchmark market index, ended up 1.7 percent at 778.25 rupees, after having risen as much as 2.4 percent during the day, in a main Mumbai market that rose 0.7 percent. Indian issuers of overseas bonds have been kept on the sidelines in the last few months by volatile global markets. A slew of companies had announced plans, mandated banks or completed investor meetings for possible overseas issues, but the offerings were put on hold. Indian borrowers are especially price-sensitive and are reluctant to bring transactions in volatile markets that could upset pricing expectations. Indian companies raised &amp;amp;#36;6.6 billion in U.S. dollar bonds overseas in the first half of 2011, compared with &amp;amp;#36;2.6 billion in the same period a year earlier, attracted in part by lower yields overseas.

Mukesh Ambani, head of Reliance Industries, India's most valuable company, retained the top spot with a value of USD 22.6 billion, despite seeing his net worth drop by USD 4.4 billion. In the same period, Ambani completed construction of a 27-storey house in Mumbai, costing an estimated USD 1 billion. The biggest loser in the list was Ambani's younger brother, Anil, whose net worth stood at USD 5.9 billion, down from USD 13.3 billion. His Reliance Group companies have been some of the worst performers on the Mumbai bourse this year. A major drag for Ambani has been telecom firm Reliance Communications, which has USD 7.5 billion in debt and has so far failed in efforts to ease debt and raise money. The combined wealth of India's richest 100 people fell to USD 241 billion in 2011, according to the Forbes India Rich List, which includes 57 dollar billionaires, a dozen less than a year earlier. &amp;quot;This has been a turbulent year for India's richest,&amp;quot; Naazneen Karmali, India Editor of Forbes Asia, said in a statement. &amp;quot;Despite the economy growing at close to 8%, a spate of corruption scandals and rising inflation have taken a toll.&amp;quot; The world's second-fastest growing major economy after China grew only 7.7% in the three months to June, its weakest in 18 months, and Mumbai's benchmark stock index is down 16% since January. India has raised its interest rates 13 times in 19 months, hurting demand for big-ticket items and making it more expensive for businesses to raise capital. Of the 85 alumni from last year's list, 66 saw their worth drop this year. A net worth of USD 370 million was enough to make the 2011 list, down from USD 500 million a year ago.  Big Ten Mukesh Ambani lead a top ten dominated by industrial tycoons, including ArcelorMittal chairman Lakshmi Mittal, who came in second with a net worth of USD 19.2 billion. Energy and metal barons Shashi and Ravi Ruia lie fourth with a combined worth of USD 10.2 billion. Kumar Birla, head of the fabrics-to-cement Aditya Birla conglomerate, Adi Godrej of the Godrej Group and construction tycoon Pallonji Mistry -- the largest individual shareholder of the Tata Group and father-in-law to Noel Tata, touted as a likely successor to Ratan Tata -- are also in the top ten. Many of those companies are benefiting from India's plans to spend USD 1 trillion in the five years to 2017 to overhaul its creaking infrastructure, seen as a barrier to continued economic growth. Only one name from India's showpiece IT sector made the top ten: Azim Premji, chairman of Wipro, India's No. 3 software services provider, ranked third with a net worth of USD 13 billion.  Savitri Jindal, head of Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, was India's richest woman, sitting fifth on the list with a net worth of USD 9.5 billion. Jindal was one of only five women on the list of one hundred. A USD 39 billion telecom scandal, likely India's largest ever graft scam, made its mark on the list, with two accused in the case, Vinod Goenka and Shahid Balwa, falling out of the top 100. Both deny any wrongdoing. Debutants on the annual list include Kapil Bhatia and his son Rahul, founders of budget airline IndiGo, and V.G. Siddhartha, whose coffee shop chain Cafe Coffee Day gave him a net worth of USD 595 million. India's biggest gainer in percentage terms was Brijmohan Lall Munjal, head of two-wheeler HeroMoto Corp, whose net worth rose to USD 2.7 billion in the year his firm ended a 26-year partnership with Japan's Honda Motor. India's auto industry has seen car sales declining on high interest rates while families of four continue to buy two-wheelers, most of which can be bought without relying on loans."

Samvat 2067 that entered with much enthusiasm and high expectations would finally end with record number of negative developments from economic, political, cultural, social (domestic and global). Never in the past memory has the market seen so many events in a single year, most of which were negative. The unravelling of scams related to 2G, CWG, Housing, bribery, Euro Zone credit crisis, US debt ratings down grade by S&amp;amp;amp;P, geopolitical crisis in the Middle East and North African countries which eventually led to regime change in Egypt and Libya and earth quake in Japan, and so on. It was, as a matter of fact, a year of the Cleanse! If at all this leads to the cleaning of the Indian systems by eradicating corruption, the positive side of it all may be seen in the longer term. To make matters worse for the Equity markets, relentless rise in inflation led by food and non-food items, hawkish interest rates stance by RBI and policy paralysis of the government whose functioning were marred due to anti corruptions crusade, all led to sell off in equities. Sensex and Nifty on Monday Oct. 24th 2011 closed down 19 percent from their closing on Muhurat Day of Samvat 2067 at 16939 and 5098 respectively.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Samvat 2068 is likely to be better in terms of fundamentals as most of the negatives of the previous year get corrected this year. Significant changes may be seen in the latter part of Samvat 2068 only. We expect the next three-six months testing times for the market but gradually seeing improvement in fundamentals towards the other half of the SAMVAT 2068. The impact of the hardening policy is likely to bring down manufactured inflation hence giving reasons for the RBI to breathe easy and bring down rates. The Indian consumption boom is likely to be rejuvenated once interest rates come down.  This Diwali, we focus on only large cap companies that has fallen significantly from their peak and whose fundamentals remain strong in the longer term.

Historically RIL is known for its forward and backward integration which has created a size which is unmatched in Indian corporate history. Major reasons to shed RIL from portfolios have been in anticipation of its declining ROE.

With retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Carrefour circling India in anticipation of a rule change that would allow foreign investment in supermarkets, Asia's richest man is scrambling to capitalise on his early mover advantage. Over the past few months, Reliance has accelerated store openings, brought in a management team from Wal-Mart China and launched wholesale operations that serve the small mom-and-pop players dominating the &amp;amp;#36;450 billion Indian retail sector. It has also rolled out its first large-format hypermarket outlets selling everything from food to furniture. &amp;quot;In retail they are still a long way off,&amp;quot; said Michiel van Voorst, portfolio manager for Asia-Pacific equities at Robeco Hong Kong, which is considering buying into the stock it sold off three years ago, tempted by its 22% decline in 2011. &amp;quot;The business will still require a lot of investments, and there is no synergy to any of other activities of the company,&amp;quot; said van Voorst, whose firm manages USD 2 billion in Asia.   Reliance battles the same problems that have thwarted faster growth for organised retail in Asia's third-largest economy, including expensive real estate and opposition from politically powerful small shop-owners, farmers and middlemen. At the launch of the retail arm in 2006, the energy-focused conglomerate set out to build a USD 20 billion-revenue business by 2011. For fiscal 2011 ended March 31, however, retail sales were just Rs 5,677 billion (USD 1.1 billion), according to two analysts' estimates, an increase of 27%, but a tiny share of the group's total haul of USD 53 billion. Net loss in the business is estimated to have doubled to Rs&amp;amp;nbsp;446 billion. The company acknowledges its retail business is loss-making but declined to verify those figures.  Tough Market Reliance is the country's second-largest retailer by sales behind Future Group's Pantaloon Retail, but its overall market share is small in a country where more than 90% of the industry is made up of mom-and-pop stores. After launching operations in November 2006, it grew to about 1,000 stores within three years, but soon found it did not have the systems and infrastructure to support that expansion. Staff attrition, poor locations, supply-chain issues and infrastructure problems prompted it to shut nearly 50 stores within two years of the launch. Since then, the company has standardised its operations and increased centralisation of its supply chain. &amp;quot;During the 2008 slowdown, we thought we were insulated but we have learnt a lot from what we did ,&amp;quot; Bijou Kurien, chief executive of Reliance Retail's lifestyle arm, told Reuters. Reliance's supermarket push hit major hurdles in 2007 and 2008, when it was chased out of the states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous region, after protests by small-shop owners and farmers. Reliance still does not have supermarkets in Uttar Pradesh, which was supposed to generate 15% of its retail revenue by 2011. It also lacks a major store presence in eastern India. The standalone &amp;quot;kirana&amp;quot; shops, or neighbourhood mom-and-pop stores, and street-side vendors where most Indians buy groceries are popular because they are convenient and give credit. They also operate with little overheads, forcing chains to compete on razor-thin margins. Still, some of Reliance's local rivals including Pantaloons and Shopper's Stop have managed to make a profit, helped by a compact network of stores. &amp;quot;The idea is to expand and make money in every store that we set up, and that would be the way in which we scale the business,&amp;quot; Kurien said.  New faces, big boxes To jumpstart its retail business, Reliance recently brought in Wal-Mart China's former chief operating officer Rob Cissell to head its supermarkets, along with his ex-colleague Shawn Gray, making up the retailer's third management team since 2006. Its original management was replaced in 2009 with a team of expatriates led by Gwyn Sundhagul from Tesco Lotus in Thailand. He now works in another Reliance business. &amp;quot;We are now going into a phase of execution,&amp;quot; a senior executive at Reliance Retail said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. &amp;quot;Our hypermarket initiative is now being driven by someone who has done this earlier in China, which is a similar market.&amp;quot; The changes at the top coincide with an expansion push that saw it open 60 stores in the last quarter, including its first two hypermarkets, which opened last month. That brought its overall store count to about 1,050. The large-format stores are between 60,000 and 100,000 square feet and by next year will be supported by distribution centres in Delhi, Bangalore and Pune. &amp;quot;The quality and efficiencies are much higher. The margin mix improves considerably. Small stores bring you visibility, but you need the big boxes for balance,&amp;quot; the executive said. Reliance also last month opened its first cash-and-carry, or wholesale, store in Ahmedabad, entering a format which Wal-Mart already tried with six such outlets in India through a joint venture with the parent of telecoms firm Bharti Airtel. &amp;quot;We have also realised that 'kirana' stores will continue to coexist, so why not supply to them? It is an opportunity and we will not leave any opportunity,&amp;quot; the Reliance official said. Supermarkets account for 65% of Reliance's retail business, while specialty shops including local tie-up with global brands like Marks &amp;amp;amp; Spencer, and Diesel make up the rest. &amp;quot;Their big gap is how to stabilise and run the operations. They have to stick to one plan and move, and that is their biggest challenge,&amp;quot; said Pinakiranjan Mishra, head for consumer products and retail at advisory firm Ernst &amp;amp;amp; Young. &amp;quot;If you change the model every one-and-a-half, two years and if you change the team, everything has to be reset,&amp;quot; he said.  Financia Muscle The advantage Reliance holds over its Indian rivals is its financial muscle. While local chains, many of them loss-making and cash-constrained, look to hook up with the global players keen to enter India once rules allow, Reliance has the wherewithal and the intention to go it alone. &amp;quot;The area which is of concern for other retailers is finding capital. That is not so much a challenge for us,&amp;quot; said Kurien. Reliance, which owns the world's biggest oil refinery, boasted USD 12.6 billion of cash at the end of September. Reliance also has the advantage of time, as a politically weakened leadership in New Delhi drags its feet on allowing foreign investment into multi-brand retail, which is opposed by sections of the ruling Congress party as well as the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. Wal-Mart and others are expected to take years to build scale in a challenging Indian market. &amp;quot;There will certainly be competition, possibly price wars,&amp;quot; said Anish Sarkar, head of consulting at Capgemini India. &amp;quot;But the battle for the next few years will not be for market share but for expanding the market itself.&amp;quot; But not everyone is convinced that retail is the best use of Reliance's formidable resources. &amp;quot;I can understand if they want to invest in organised retail, but they should be investing in that outside of the main company, from separate capital,&amp;quot; Robeco's van Voorst said. &amp;quot;Otherwise there is concern that capital that yielded high returns is now deployed in assets that are not yielding much value,&amp;quot; he said. With growth in its core energy business below expectations over the past year, Reliance has been keen to diversify and has ventured into areas such as telecoms and financial services. Reliance is hopeful that the new management would exceed the 20 percent same-store sales growth that it is on track for this fiscal year, gradually giving the business higher visibility. &amp;quot;We have big plans for this business,&amp;quot; Kurien said. &amp;quot;We want to be the largest retail company in the country, as no one really remembers who came second.&amp;quot; (Editing by Tony Munroe and Vinu Pilakkott)"

Reliance: Open interest in Reliance has increased by 24% with the stock moving from 770 to 860 levels suggesting accumulation of long positions. The fresh build up in Reliance in the October series started on a low base. We believe roll spread in the stock may remain in the range of 2-4 points till settlement. The stock has seen the maximum Call base at 860 followed by 840 strike, which is likely to be the major resistance in the coming sessions.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;SBI: SBI witnessed addition of 26% open interest when it fell from 1930 to 1720 levels. However, when the stock recovered towards 1930 again, it witnessed closure of 10% short positions leaving almost 16% shorts in the stock. We expect these shorts to be rolled to the November series and the roll spread may not widen beyond 4 points. However, the spread may reduce to sub 1 level if the stock moves below 1850.&amp;amp;nbsp;HDFC Bank: Post September series, the stock observed selling pressure and plunged from 465 to 438 levels before it recovered back to 480 since the second week of October. However, no major change in open interest was seen during this volatile move. The previously rolled open interest from the September series had a long bias. We expect the same to be carried forward to the November series. The roll spread is likely to remain in the range of 1-2 points, which was seen near September settlement also.  TCS: Post the announcement of Infosys results, TCS added 21% open interest with long bias and the stock also moved up by 9%. Recently the stock surpassed the major resistance of 1080 which was the 1-year trend line below which it broke down in the month of August. However the recent disappoint in Q2 results may lead to long liquidation in the stock and it may be dragged towards 1000 levels. In such a scenario, the roll spread may shrink. The stuck up long positions are likely to be rolled into next series. The roll spread has already shrunk to 1 point in this series from 3-4 points seen in the previous series. We believe the rollover of long positions in declining stock may not keep the roll spread on the higher side and it may not widen beyond 1 point.

Satellite fields in the KG-D6 block and discoveries, also known as the 'R-Series', together are estimated to have the potential to produce 35 mmscmd.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  RIL has submitted plans to invest USD 1.5 billion on developing four satellite fields to produce up to 10 mmscmd of gas by 2016.

The firm, India's most valuable company by market capitalization, has seen its growth outlook and market value hit hard this year by falling gas output from its huge gas fields off the east coast. Reliance will halt drilling for an unspecified time until the review is completed and submitted to the government, three analysts present at a company meeting told the newspaper. A Reliance spokesman declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters. Controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, Reliance posted its highest ever quarterly net profit in its Q2 results on Saturday, but analysts focused on slowing gas output and said refining margins were still below expectations. Last month, India's upstream regulator said Reliance was producing 44 mscmd (million standard cubic metres per day) from its main D6 block, lower than the 60 mscmd it was producing a year earlier and far off the planned peak capacity of 80 mscmd. The CAG last month criticised Reliance and the government over development of the gas field in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin and called for revamping profit-sharing arrangements from oil and gas blocks. Earlier this year, Reliance sold a 30 percent stake in 23 oil and gas blocks, some in the KG basin, to BP in a 7.2 billion deal. The British company, with deepwater exploration expertise, has said it is confident of raising gas output from the field from 2014."

UTV Software said it had no immediately comment on the report, while Reliance could not be immediately reached. Reliance, which has diversified into telecom, retail, financial services and hospitality sectors in recent years from its core business of refining and oil and gas exploration, last year acquired Infotel, which emerged as the only firm to secure nationwide wireless broadband radio airwaves in an auction. The deal is expected to give Reliance access to games, entertainment and children's content for their telecom operations, the paper said. Reliance has plans of building a data-focused business which will provide mobile, smartphone, tablet and computer users access to the net and online related services via a wireless broadband network. The diversified company, which has been under pressure from falling gas output, has pushed for tie-ups in recent months to boost its business. In June, Reliance signed a joint venture with DE Shaw, a US hedge fund, for acquiring Bharti Enterprises 74% stake in an insurance joint venture with France's Axa. The following month the Indian cabinet approved Reliance's plan to sell a stake in 21 of 23 planned oil and gas blocks to BP as part of a USD 7.2 billion deal.  At 10:24 a.m. (0454 GMT), shares in Reliance, valued at USD 53.5 billion, were up 1.5% at Rs 815 in a firm Mumbai market. The stock has been a laggard, falling 24% in the year to date compared with a 21% drop in the main index, largely due to falling gas output."

CAG ignored the operational and technical facts and data as well, he added.  CAG in its report had stated that the contract was violated by RIL was allowed to retain the entire 7,645 sq km of its KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) block in the Bay of Bengal after the giant Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds were made in 2001.

RIL said no material relating to operational and technical matters relating to the KG-D6 block was sought from the company even though the CAG report has commented on them.  Stating that it was not given access to the full draft report of CAG for comments, the company said extracts that were previously held were only provided after the official auditor held the so-called 'Exit Conference' on July 12 to conclude the audit.  RIL was given just a week to respond and the company &amp;quot;did its best to send as complete a response given the time allotted&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Unfortunately, the CAG refused to consider any response submitted by RIL after the Exit Conference. Therefore, the fact is that CAG, for reasons best known to it, chose to ignore operational and technical fasts and data,&amp;quot; it wrote.  On non-relinquishment of block, RIL said: &amp;quot;Retention of discovery area is a geological issue and not an accounting issue. As such it is best settled by technical experts, which was also done in this case. CAG made no attempt to or even gave RIL the opportunity to explain how in geological terms the entire block did quality to be declared a Discovery Area as per the PSC.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Retaining acreage as Discovery Area in effect entails no benefit to the contractor,&amp;quot; it said adding RIL is willing to make a presentation to the CAG on the issues brought out by CAG.

The total value of M&amp;amp;amp;A deals in the first nine months of 2011 was largely accounted for by two inbound deals -- BP Plc's USD 7.2 billion transaction for acquisition of stake in Reliance Industries' oil and gas properties and Vodafone Group Plc's purchase of partner Essar's 33% stake in Vodafone Essar Limited (USD 5.46 billion).

RIL on October 1 served a notice for suspension of supplies to plants of Indo Gulf Fertiliser, IFFCO, KRIBHCO, Shyam Fertilisers and Tata Chemicals from 0600 hours tomorrow, sources privy to the development said. The fertiliser firms, which produce about 2 million tonnes of urea from gas sourced from RIL, are opposed to providing financial guarantees in the form of letters of credit (LC) to cover for liabilities arising out of the levy of local sales tax on gas sales, as it would increase the cost of production and subsidy payouts. RIL supplies some 4 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 fields to these plants. Like elsewhere in the country, it has been charging central sales tax of 2 per cent from users in Uttar Pradesh. However, the state government has refused to accept these transactions as inter-state sales and have demanded that local sales tax of 21 per cent should be paid. Tax as the liability of consumers has been clearly enshrined in the Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPAs) RIL signed with fertiliser andother users. Naturally, users should have contested the demand for higher sales tax, but strangely, RIL went to the Allahabad High Court challenging the demand. The High Court on July 26, 2010, stayed the Uttar Pradesh government demand. The state government has appealed against the stay in Supreme Court. Sources said RIL is demanding that users in Uttar Pradesh enhance the value of their Letters of Credit, which were previously submitted as guarantees against default, to cover for payments in case the state sales tax liability was to materalise. So far, state power utility NTPC is the only firm that has enhanced its LC, while fertiliser firms have not complied with RIL's demand so far, leading to the notice for suspension of supplies. While the fertiliser firms refused comments, the Fertiliser Association of India (FAI) has shot off letters to the Oil and Fertiliser Ministry protesting against the RIL move. In an October 3 letter, FAI Director General Satish Chander said there was no need for enhancing the LCs as the Supreme Court has not vacated the stay given by the Allahabad High Court. &amp;quot;Any increase in the limit of LC will increase the cost of domestic urea production and has a direct bearing on the subsidy payable by the government. The demand of RIL for a higher LC is totally unjustified,&amp;quot; he wrote. RIL had last year, too, threatened to suspend supply to the fertiliser plants with effect from July 15, 2010, if the value of their LCs were not raised. While the threat was executed, RIL has again issued the notice because the tax liability, in case the Uttar Pradesh government's demand is upheld, amounts to a whopping Rs 750 crore. While Chander asked for the intervention of Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi and Fertiliser Secretary Sutanu Behuria in the matter, sources said RIL has also informed the Oil Ministry of the notice for suspension of supplies. Chander said any disruption in RIL gas supply will affect production of urea, whose demand has been &amp;quot;very good&amp;quot; because of heightened agricultural activity on the back of the good monsoon. &amp;quot;Any loss in production of urea will have to be met through higher imports. We will be substituting low cost urea production in the country by a very high cost of imported urea. The country will end up paying heavily through the exchequer,&amp;quot; he wrote. Fertiliser companies would also be liable to pay a penalty under the 'ship or pay' clause of their Gas Transportation Agreements with Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd (RGTIL) and state-owned GAIL India Ltd. &amp;quot;The Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) has allocated the gas to fertiliser units on a priority basis for full capacity utilisation of urea plants in view of fertiliser being an essential input for agriculture. RIL's decision to unilaterally decide to stop the supply of gas to fertiliser plants in UP is unjustified and also violative of the decision of the EGoM,&amp;quot; he added."

Reliance on September 16 submitted to the Oil Ministry a formula for pricing of 3 million standard cubic meters per day of CBM it plans to produce from Sohagpur block in Madhya Pradesh, sources privy to the development said. The formula is the same as the one at which RasGas of Qatar sells liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a long-term contract to India. According to the formula, Reliance wants 12.67% of the prevailing Japanese Crude Coctail (JCC) plus 0.26 per mmBtu, they said. JCC is now ruling around USD 100 per barrel and CBM price according to this formula comes to USD 12.67 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, totaling USD 12.93 per mmBtu. But industry observes scoffed at the price sought saying RasGas supplies gas rich in compounds like ethane (C2) and propane (C3) which are useful in manufacture of LPG and petrochemicals. Whereas, CBM is just methane (C1) and should therefore be priced at least 15-20% discount to the price of rich or C2/C3 compound-rich gas. Also, LNG pricing cannot be applied for domestic gas as huge investment goes into putting a liquefication plant that turns natural gas into its liquid state by cooling it at sub-zero temperature. Sources said Reliance in the price approval letter states that the formula it is suggesting is arrived at on an arms-length basis. RasGas prices the 7.5 million tons a year (about 30 mmscmd) gas it sells to Petronet LNG Ltd at 12.67% of JCC. Another USD 0.26 per mmBtu is the cost it takes for shipping the gas cooled to turn it into liquid (called LNG) in cryogenic ships. Reliance has lifted this formula and has sought pricing of its CBM in line with that. Great Eastern Energy Corp Ltd (GEECL) is selling CBM is produces from its Raniganj block in West Bengalat USD 6.79 per mmBtu while domestically produced natural gas is priced at USD 4.2 to USD 5.73 per mmBtu. The natural gas Reliance produces from its eastern offshore KG-D6 fields is priced at USD 4.205 per mmBtu for five years ending March 31, 2014. Sources said Reliance has sought expeditious approval of the CBM price so that it can sign gas sales and purchase agreements (GSPAs).

Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said on Wednesday the company's partnership with BP would not be limited to India, but was initially focusing only on opportunities in the country. &amp;quot;...I will sit down with Mukesh and the team at Reliance and see what their aspirations are and there may be prospects there,&amp;quot; Dudley, who met with Indian government officials in New Delhi on Wednesday, was quoted as saying by the Economic Times. &amp;quot;There might be some divestments, they might be joining us in some projects, or it could be that we identify new projects together -- acquisitions, entry into other kinds of projects, so I think all the scope is there,&amp;quot; he told the newspaper, adding there was potential for some in North America and Europe. Reliance and BP in India were not immediately available for comment on the report."

Like his visit soon after taking over as the chief executive of Europe's second biggest oil company in October last year, Dudley is likely to call on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, sources privy to the development said. Accompanied by Reliance Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani, he is scheduled to meet Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy in the forenoon on Wednesday and several others before ending the day with a dinner hosted by British High Commission here. Dudley and Ambani are likely to call on Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Commerce Minister Anand Sharma and former Oil Minister Murli Deora among others. The next day, Dudley flies to Krishna Godavari basin, home to Reliance's crownjewel KG-D6 gas fields which have been at the centre of BP's USD 7.2 billion investment in buying 30% stake in 23 oil and gas properties held by the Mukesh Ambani firm. Ambani is likely to host a dinner for Dudley on Thursday evening at his residence in Mumbai. Sources said Dudley's visit is more of a thanks giving on conclusion of the USD 7.2 billion deal and a possible kick-off for a partnership with Reliance. Though the government had after nearly six months given its go ahead to the deal last month, BP has not yet formally been inducted as amendments to the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) are yet to be approved and signed by the upstream oil regulator DGH. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 22 cleared the sale of stake by RIL to BP in 21 blocks, including the showpiece eastern offshore KG-D6 gas producing area and discovery area NEC-25. However, it held back the same for two inconsequential blocks one a deep sea area off the Orissa coast and the other an onland block in Assam - over technical issues. The formal letter conveying the approval was however sent only in August. The deal, which might increase in value to USD 20 billion on the basis of future performance payments and investment, will give Reliance access to BP's expertise in deepwater drilling and accelerate development and production from its fields, particularly the under-performing KG-D6 block in the eastern offshore. For BP, which has been struggling to recover from the disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster last year, the transaction is a chance to enter a market where energy demand is growing at 5-8%. "

Reliance had in December, 2009, submitted to the regulator an optimised development plan for four satellite gas fields around the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6, block. It proposed to invest USD 1.529 billion in producing up to 10 million standard cubic metres per day from the four discoveries in five years' time. &amp;quot;Considering the production profile (drawn up by the DGH) and the cost estimates and project schedule as provided by operator (Reliance), the project yields a negative Net Present Value of USD 239 million at the gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units,&amp;quot; the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) told the Oil Ministry in a note seeking approval for the development plan. Reliance projected first gas from the Dhirubhai-2, 6, 19 and 22 (D-2, D-6, D-19 and D-22) fields in 2016. The DGH said if royalty is excluded from project cost and capital expenditure is phased over a period of two years before the date of first gas extraction, the project becomes marginally viable. &amp;quot;The projected total revenue and Net Present Value (NPV) of the cash flow at a 10% discount factor are USD 2,360 million and USD 33 million, respectively. The project becomes marginally economically viable,&amp;quot; it said. But royalty in any case has to be paid to the government. Reliance had in 2007 proposed a price of USD 4.33 per mmBtu for gas from KG-D6. The government however tweaked the formula and fixed the sale price at USD 4.205 per mmBtu for the first five years of production. DGH has evaluated the new finds in KG-D6 at the government-approved price and did not consider a higher rate that may be fixed in 2014, when the price comes up for review. Reliance has so far made 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. It had in July, 2008, submitted a field development plan for nine satellite gas discoveries (D-2, D-4, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-16, D-19, D-22 and D-23) with an estimated capex of USD 5.6 billion and reserves of 1,708 billion cubic feet (BCF). The DGH, the paper said, carried out techno-economic feasibility studies at a gas price of USD 4.2 per mmBtu and projected total revenue and NPV at a 10% discount factor at USD 6.52 billion and negative USD 2.51 billion, respectively. The regulator then told Reliance that the development plan needs to be optimised. Reliance submitted the optimised development plan for the four satellite gas fields in end-2009. Reliance estimated 1,733 BCF of in-place gas reserves in the four finds, of which 626 BCF can be produced. However, the DGH trimmed down the estimates to 1,342 BCF and 617 BCF, respectively."

The ministry and its technical arm, the DGH, are upset with RIL because production from the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) gas fields in the prolific KG-D6 block has fallen from 61 million cubic metres per day in March, 2010, to about 37 mmcmd, instead of rising to 61.88 mmcmd, as projected by the company when it got its USD 8.8 billion capital expenditure plan for development of the field approved in 2006. The ministry has attributed the fall in output to non-fulfillment of RIL's commitment to drill 22 wells in the field. RIL has so far spent USD 5.694 billion on the two fields and has recovered USD 5.258 billion from the sale of gas produced. However, the ministry wants to limit cost recovery in the block in proportion to the slippage in output vis-a-vis the stipulated timeline, reducing RIL's entitlement to USD 3.405 billion. The firm however feels such a move would be ultra vires, or beyond the ministry's powers, as the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) does not have any such provision and the USD 1.85 billion already recovered by RIL cannot be reversed. &amp;quot;If the PSC were indeed to be re-written to link cost recovery to levels of production, it would also have to include provisions for allowing the contractor (RIL) to recover costs in excess of his investment in case he were to achieve a rate of production higher than that estimated at the time of capex approval,&amp;quot; RIL senior vice-president (commercial) B Ganguly wrote to the ministry on September 16. RIL said production below the original estimates meant the company loses its right to recover its investment within the originally estimated timeframe, causing huge losses in terms of sunk capital. Besides, RIL has already suffered huge erosion of market cap due to news of the fall in production. RIL said as per the PSC, all costs and production numbers provided in the field development plan (like the one approved for KG-D6 in 2006) are only estimates based on the understanding of the reservoir and the market prices at any given point of time and &amp;quot;such estimates cannot be construed as constituting a commitment under the PSC.&amp;quot; KG-D6 wells did not perform as per the FDP, as a severe drop in reservoir pressure and acute water ingress has already forced closure of two out of the 18 well drilled so far. The Oil Ministry's views have been backed by Solicitor General of India that said RIL should not be allowed to recover the cost of facilities that remain underutilised due to lower than anticipated output at its KG-D6 gas field. SGI Rohinton F Nariman on August 17 opined that &amp;quot;the cost/expenditure incurred in constructing production/processing facilities and pipelines that are currently underutilised/have excess capacity cannot be recovered&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;There is no provision under the production sharing contract (PSC) that can limit cost-recovery to either production levels achieved by a contractor or to the extent that facilities are utilised under a development plan at any given point of time,&amp;quot; RIL wrote. &amp;quot;To even suggest that the contractor should, over and above this loss, forego his basic investment by foregoing cost recovery would be contrary to the fundamental notion of the PSC,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Any such attempt being contrary to the letter as well as spirit of the PSC would only trigger unnecessary disputes between the contractor and the government leading to needless arbitration proceedings,&amp;quot; it added. The initial field development plan (FDP) for the D1 and D3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3 block (KG-D6) envisaged a capex of USD 2.47 billion at a peak production rate of 40 mmcmd from 14 wells. Subsequently, RIL submitted an addendum saying the size of the gas reserves was twice the estimate of 5.32 tcf in the initial plan, at 11.3 trillion cubic feet. It proposed a USD 8.835 billion capex over two phases and envisaged a peak output of 80 mmcmd from 31 producing wells by April, 2012. Commercial gas production from the D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 fields commenced from April 1, 2009. RIL in December, 2009, tested its field production facilities at their full rated capacity of 80 mmcmd, during which time an average gas rate of 77-80mmcmd was maintained for a brief period of three days. Subsequently, the gas production rate was maintained at 57-61 mmcmd for a four-month period (January, 2010, to April, 2010). Subsequently, the gas production rate has gradually declined and the current rate is about 37 mmcmd, as against the approved FDP rate of 61.88 mmcmd for the year 2011-12. RIL says the gas production rate will remain in the range of 40-38 mmcmd, as against the projected peak of 80 mmcmd, till mid-2013 and also that no new well will hooked up to production facilities till mid-2013-14. The ministry claims that the DGH has repeatedly asked RIL to comply with the approved FDP work programme by drilling two more wells and connecting two other wells to its production system by the first quarter of 2011-12 fiscal. It asked RIL to drill another nine wells by March 31, 2012. However, RIL has failed to comply with the directive and to penalise the firm, the Oil Ministry has now threatened to restrict cost-recovery on a pro rata basis at the current production rate of 37 mmcmd, reducing RIL's entitlement to USD3.405 billion."

The output comprised 37.1 mmscmd from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) gas fields and 7.4 mmscmd from MA oil field in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. D1 and D3 gas fields produced 37.7 mmscmd of gas in August, while output from MA field was 7.1 mmscmd. As per the status report, out of the 22 wells to be drilled in the Phase-I of Dhirubhai-1 and 3 field development plan, 18 wells have been drilled and completed so far. Of these, 16 wells were put on production as two wells (B2 and B13) were kept closed due to high water cut. MA oilfield produced an average of 14,080 barrels of crude oil per day besides the 7.4 mmscmd of associated gas. Of the total 44.5 mmscmd, about 13.8 mmscmd of gas was sold to fertiliser plants and another 24.1 mmscmd to power plants. The remaining 6.6 mmscmd was consumed by other sectors like sponge iron plants, LPG, city gas distribution networks and petrochemical/refineries. Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singh had last month informed Parliament that output from KG-D6 was short of 70.39 mmscmd envisaged by now as per the field development plan approved in 2006. &amp;quot;The contractor (Reliance) was advised by (oil regulator) DGH to expeditiously drill more development wells in D1 and D3 field as per FDP in order to enhance gas production in KG-DWN-98/3 block,&amp;quot; he had stated. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the committed 22 wells on D1 and D3 as reservoir has not performed on expected lines. Of the 20 wells drilled, only 18 wells are under production. Further in the FDP approved in 2006, Reliance had committed to drill 31 wells by the current fiscal-end. Reliance currently holds 90 per cent interest in KG-D6, while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling 30% in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for USD 7.2 billion. Reliance started natural gas production from KG-D6 fields from April 1, 2009. Its partner Niko had last month stated that &amp;quot;declines (in production) are expected to continue until work-overs are completed and/or additional wells are tied-in&amp;quot;. The present output is less than about 60 mmscmd production in the same period a year-ago. "

Responding to upstream oil and gas production regulator DGH reopening the issue, RIL Executive Director P M S Prasad on August 24 wrote to Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi saying the USD 0.135 per million British thermal units marketing margin is a cost levied beyond the gas delivery flange and as such, is not regulated by the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The PSC governs fixation of price of gas at the 'delivery point', the point at which an upstream operator transfers custody of gas to a marketing and transportation agency. That point for eastern offshore KG-D6 gas is Kakinada, in Andhra Pradesh, and the government had in 2007 approved a gas price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu at the delivery point. But the DGH wants the USD 0.135 per mmBtu levy added to the gas sale price and profits for RIL and the government to be calculated thereafter. Currently, profits are calculated by deducting capital and the operating cost from the gas sales price only. Prasad, however, said the PSC does not provide for such a move, as the marketing and transportation cost cannot be recovered from revenues earned from sale of oil or gas. Section 3.2 (iii) of the PSC states that &amp;quot;costs of marketing or transportation of petroleum beyond the delivery point are not cost-recoverable. Both marketing and transport costs are clearly recognised as being distinct from the sale price at the delivery point and kept outside the PSC for purposes of cost recovery,&amp;quot; he wrote. He said any attempt to include the margin as part of the price of gas approved under the PSC &amp;quot;will have the effect of making all marketing costs as well as ensuing risks and liabilities cost-recoverable under the PSC.&amp;quot; Moreover, such inclusion can be done only after amendment of the present PSC. The marketing margin is to cover for cost of employees involved in marketing and sales, related infrastructure and all legal and operational expenses that occur beyond the delivery point, as defined in the PSC.  It also covers the credit risk of buyers, litigation costs and penalties such as ship-or-pay reimbursement to transporters and levies for supplying off-spec gas. &amp;quot;Any costs associated with these risks are at the moment not chargeable to the PSC for the purpose of cost-recovery and are not being claimed as such by&amp;quot; RIL, he added. He pointed to state-run ONGC and GAIL charging a marketing margin on government-administered gas, called APM gas, as well as on the produce from the Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields."

Srivastava told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference, when asked about the current output from the Reliance block, off the country's east coast. Reliance, controlled by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, has been under fire in recent months from the regulator, investors and analysts over slowing gas output from its main KG D6 block. The production figure is much lower than the 60 mscmd it produced a year earlier, and far off the planned peak capacity of 80 mscmd. Earlier this year, Reliance sold a 30% stake in 21 oil and gas blocks, some in the KG basin, to BP in a USD 7.2 billion deal, in part to benefit from BP's expertise in deep-water exploration."

Sources privy to the development said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had been pressurising RIL to drill the committed 22 wells by March 2011, so that Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields can produce projected 61.88 mmcmd and MA field (also in the same block) another 8.1 mmcmd. But when RIL, which was not confident of the geology after pressure at current 18 wells fell and some showed water ingress, refused, DGH proposed to allow only proportionate recovery of cost. On DGH insistence, oil ministry sought a view from the second highest law officer of the country. SGI Rohinton F Nariman on August 17 opined that &amp;quot;the cost/expenditure incurred in constructing production/ processing facilities and pipelines that are currently underutilised/have excess capacity cannot be recovered&amp;quot;. The Production Sharing Contract (PSC), however, does not envisage such a move and if oil ministry is to order such a thing, RIL is likely to challenge it and may initiate arbitration proceedings. Sources said no field development plan by any company anywhere in the world, including 40-50 put by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), have gone exactly as per the plans put on paper because of uncertainty involved in behaviour of what lies several thousand feet below the earth. ONGC had on about a dozen occasions changed field development plan for its prime Mumbai High oil and gas fields. RIL is waiting for BP Plc, who has global expertise in deepsea exploration, to come on board before recommencing drilling at KG-D6. Nariman in his opinion states that the government has &amp;quot;an arguable case&amp;quot; to stop RIL from recovering expenditure which had &amp;quot;resulted in excess capacity / under-utilisation of the asset created&amp;quot; on account of its failure to adhere to the 2006 approved field development plan. According to the 2006 plan, RIL was to drill a further 11 wells by March 2012 to raise output to 80 mmscmd and sustain it at those levels for 9 years. RIL has so far spent USD 5.693 billion and has already recovered USD 5.258 billion from sale of gas. Nariman advised that to the extent RIL has already recovered capital expenditure from sale of gas, &amp;quot;the cost entitlement of the contractor can be reversed&amp;quot;. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report on KG-D6 field audit, which was tabled in Parliament earlier this month, had not commented on reasonability of RIL hiking the capital expenditure at the nation's biggest gas field from USD 2.4 billion proposed in 2004 to USD 8.8 billion estimate in 2006. It, however, stated that with the gas output from KG-D6 falling to about 43 million standard cubic meters per day, which is close to 40 mmscmd output level envisaged in the 2004 investment plan, raised &amp;quot;doubts if upgradation to 80 mmscmd with substantial increase in development cost (to USD 8.8 billion) was justified&amp;quot;. RIL submitted an initial development plan (IDP) for Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds in May 2004 with capital expenditure of USD 2.4 billion. This was followed up with an Addendum to the IDP (AIDP) in October 2006 proposing USD 5.2 billion capex in Phase-1 and USD 3.6 billion in Phase-II. &amp;quot;Most procurement activities were undertaken late in the line with the schedules of the IDP of May 2004. By contrast, activities in respect of items in the AIDP were initiated even before the submission/approval of the AIDP. Clearly, the development activities of the operator were guided by AIDP, rather than IDP,&amp;quot; CAG had said in the report."

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its final report on Rajasthan block audit, tabled in Parliament, said Cairn had in 2006 proposed USD 1.24 billion for developing the Mangala oil field in the block. A revised field development plan (FDP) was submitted three years later in 2009 due to change in delivery point of crude oil from Barmer in Rajasthan to Salaya and later to Bhogat in Gujarat, which necessitated laying of pipeline. &amp;quot;On June 30, 2009, the Management Committee approved the revised FDP at a cost of USD 2.367 billion, plus USD 941.05 million as the cost of the pipeline, plus USD 35.61 million as cost of Mangala (field) enhanced oil recovery (scheme); ie a total cost of USD 3.34 billion,&amp;quot; it said. The increase in revised FDP was primarily attributed to nearly doubling of upstream capital cost during 2005 and 2007, increase in rig hiring charges and delay in project schedule. Reliance too had cited more or less similar reasons for raising capex for Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds in the prolific KG-D6 block from USD 2.4 billion proposed in May 2004 to USD 8.8 billion (USD 5.2 billion in Phase-1 and rest in Phase-II) in October 2006 as it built facilities to handle 80 million standard cubic meters per day as against 40 mmscmd previously. The CAG said the oil ministry had informed that the increase in capex was also due to changes in the production facilities in view of increased production rates from 100,000 barrels per day to 125,000 barrels per day. &amp;quot;Most of the expenditure under the revised FDP (of Cairn) has been/would be incurred from 2008-09 and thereafter; this would be covered in future audits,&amp;quot; it said. The auditor said USD 201.54 million expense incurred by Cairn on works like exploration in development area DA-1, should not be eligible for cost recovery. &amp;quot;We also found excess expenditure of USD 27.63 million on pre-development and development activities over the approved budget for 2007-08 of USD 160.56 million, which has not been ratified by the MC,&amp;quot; it said. The CAG said 13 fresh discoveries were made during or between the appraisal phase and in the development phase in areas already delineated as development areas. &amp;quot;Consequently, in our opinion, the declaration of fresh discoveries during the appraisal/ development phases within delineated discovery/development areas amounted to irregular extension of exploration activities, which is not consonance with the terms of the PSC,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;This also indicates that the discovery/development areas were not strictly delineated, and included excess area,&amp;quot; CAG said. &amp;quot;Further, there were instances of non-compliance with regard to the PSC provisions for notification of potential commercial interest, appraisal programme, submission of field development plans etc,&amp;quot; it added."

As per the PSC, Reliance should have relinquished 25% of the total area outside the discoveries in June, 2004, and 2005, but the entire block was declared as a discovery area and the company was allowed to retain it. &amp;quot;We recommend that the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas should review the determination of the entire contract area as 'discovery area' strictly in terms of the PSC provisions,&amp;quot; the CAG said, asking for delineation of the discovery area and relinquishment of the rest. CAG sought review of the production sharing contracts, like the one Reliance had signed for KG-D6 in 1999 when BJP-led NDA was in power, saying the regime was designed to encourage hike capital expenditure by private contractors thereby reducing the government's share. &amp;quot;Given the similar conclusions that two independent agencies have reached as regards the adverse impact of the profit sharing mechanism in protecting Government of India's share designed in the late 1990s, there does seem to be enough ground to revisit the formula,&amp;quot; it said. CAG said the current PSC regime provides &amp;quot;substantial incentive to increase capital expenditure or 'front-end' capital expenditure&amp;quot; so that government take from the blocks is lower. For future PSCs, CAG recommended that the Investment-Multiple linkage with the profit sharing formula be removed. &amp;quot;Instead, the biddable profit-sharing percentage should be a single percentage. This will reduce the incentive for skewed volume and timing of capital expenditure resulting in very low Government of India share of profit petroleum. &amp;quot;Further, in order to ensure a modicum of control, very high value procurement decisions above a specified limit should be subject to approval by the Management Committee, more specifically the approval of the Government of India representatives,&amp;quot; it said. On Reliance's KG-D6 cost capex increase, it said &amp;quot;approval of estimates (first USD 2.4 billion and then USD 8.8 billion in 2006) does not constitute acceptance of the cost projects&amp;quot;, which can be done only through an audit of the actual cost incurred. Reliance submitted an initial development plan (IDP) for Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds in May 2004 with capital expenditure of USD 2.4 billion. This was followed up with an Addendum to the IDP (AIDP) in October 2006 proposing USD 5.2 billion capex in Phase-1 and USD 3.6 billion in Phase-II. &amp;quot;Most procurement activities were undertaken late in the line with the schedules of the IDP of May 2004. By contrast, activities in respect of items in the AIDP were initiated even before the submission/approval of the AIDP. Clearly, the development activities of the operator were guided by AIDP, rather than IDP,&amp;quot; it said. While expenditure incurred in 2006-07 and 2007-08 was audited by CAG, remaining expenditure incurred from 2008-09 onwards would be covered in the future audit. CAG faulted Reliance for awarding a USD 1.1 billion contract to put up a production facility at MA oilfield in the same KG-D6 block to Aker on a single bid basis. &amp;quot;During our scrutiny of the operator's records, we have come across instances, where multiple vendors were pre-qualified. However, when technical bids were received, all vendors (except one) were rejected, and the contract was finally awarded on a single financial bid,&amp;quot; it said. CAG said such disqualification of vendors on technical grounds, after a pre-qualification process and bidders' meeting for technical clarifications, limits the competitiveness which was not in accordance to the PSC. Seeking in-depth review in the award of 10 contracts (of which 8 were awarded to Aker Group companies), it said, &amp;quot;We are not even remotely suggesting that the operator should follow government procurement procedures, yet any commercially prudent private acquisition would also attempt to generate competition and thereby obtain the most competitive price.&amp;quot;"

The ministry has conveyed its displeasure to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) at the highest levels over the reopening of a long-settled issue, sources privy to the development said. It feels the DGH is wrongly interpreting the contract, which clearly states that the government is entitled to get a share of the price of gas at the delivery point. On the other hand, the marketing margin charged by the Mukesh Ambani-led firm is to intended to cover the risk involved in carrying gas from that delivery point to customers' door-step. The DGH recently asked Reliance to add the USD 0.135 per million British thermal units marketing margin to the KG-D6 gas price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu for the purpose of calculation of the government's profit take. Sources said the ministry feels a Pandora's Box will be opened if the DGH move is approved, as public sector firms like GAIL India, too, have been charging a marketing margin, which is higher than what is being levied by Reliance, for several years now. The same principle will have to be applied to gas produced from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which is marketed by GAIL. But to settle the issue once and for all, the ministry plans seek an opinion from the Law Ministry, they said. The DGH demand also runs contrary to the stance the Oil Ministry took on the issue in Parliament last year. The then-Oil Minister Murli Deora had on February 24, 2010, told the Rajya Sabha that the marketing margin was a bilateral issue between the seller (Reliance) and the buyers.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The government approved the price for gas sales at the delivery point of the KG-D6 field as per the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract inked with Reliance. &amp;quot;The said price (USD 4.2 mmBtu) does not include any charge beyond the PSC delivery point. The marketing margin (levied by Reliance) is beyond the delivery point and arises as a result of the gas sale and purchase agreement signed between the seller and the buyer,&amp;quot; Deora had stated. The PSC provides for sharing of revenues from the sale of gas between the government and the contractor at the said price at the delivery point. It does not envisage sharing of revenues earned by the contractor from marketing margins with the government, he had further said. The marketing margin was in lieu of the risks and costs incurred by the contractor on marketing the gas. It is to cover risks like seller liabilities in case of non-supply, customers drawing less than their quota, non-payment of dues and settlement of disputes.  Sources said the DGH wanted the marketing margin to be added to the gas sale price of USD 4.20 per mmBtu so that profit-sharing between the contractor and the government is calculated at the total price of USD 4.335 per mmBtu charged by RIL from its customers. At present, Reliance and the government split profits at the gas sales price of USD 4.20 per mmBtu after deducting the project cost. Besides marketing risks, the USD 0.135 per mmBtu margin is charged by Reliance on account of its extensive efforts to identify customers, execute and manage gas sales and purchase agreements (GSPAs), as well as gas sales planning, daily gas sales operations, gas accounting and invoicing and collection, sources said. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group had in 2009 opposed the levy of a marketing margin by RIL, but agreed to pay it unconditionally after an Oil Ministry clarification. Other gas marketers like state-run GAIL India also charge a marketing margin. GAIL charges a USD 0.18 per mmBtu margin on the sale of regasified-LNG and about USD 0.12 per mmBtu for gas from fields like Panna/Mukta and Tapti and Ravva."

Reliance Industries, the country's largest listed firm, has been under pressure over the past few months from an industry regulator and investors over slowing gas output from its main D6 block in the KG basin off the Andhra Pradesh coast. In May, the director general of hydrocarbons said the company was producing 48 mscmd (million standard cubic metres per day of gas) from the block, lower than 60 mscmd it produced last year and far off the planned peak capacity of 80 mscmd. But India's approval of Reliance's plan to sell stake in some oil and gas blocks to BP is expected to aid the Indian company in boosting output from the deepwater blocks. Shares in Reliance rose as much as 3.6% on Tuesday in the Mumbai market that was up 0.6%. The stock is down more than 20% so far this year, mainly triggered by concerns about slowing D6 output."

A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra allowed Mohd Furqan, a journalist, to withdraw his petition and file it at an &amp;quot;appropriate time&amp;quot; on the ground that it was &amp;quot;premature and inadequate.&amp;quot; The bench, however, said he can file a fresh petition at a later stage. &amp;quot;We allow to withdraw the writ petition and file it at an appropriate time. The prayer is allowed,&amp;quot; the bench, also comprising Justice Pradeep Nandrajog, said. The petition had sought a direction to the government for cancellation of license of RIL for exploration of gas in the KG basin alleging the firm, as per the CAG report, had increased the expenditure for exploration almost four times. &amp;quot;How we can direct the Centre to cancel the license&amp;quot;? the court said, adding there was absence of detailed data about the KG basin. The journalist cited the CAG report saying the increase in the expenditure of the company was deductible before sharing the revenue with the Government. The report of the auditing body was&amp;amp;nbsp;a&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;preliminary&amp;quot; one which is not &amp;quot;justiciable&amp;quot; and hence, the plea was &amp;quot;pre-mature and inadequate, the court said. The High Court had on August 24 decided to constitute a special bench to hear a plea seeking a direction to the government for cancellation of license granted to RIL for exploration of gas in the Krishna-Godavari basin. The decision to refer the matter before a special bench was taken by the Chief Justice as Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who was sitting with him in the bench, had recused from hearing the case. Justice Khanna did not spell out the reasons for opting out of the hearing of the case. The petitioner had also sought a direction to the Centre to take over the control and management of the KG gas project immediately from the JV. He said even after CAG reported &amp;quot;serious violation&amp;quot; of rules in the KG basin, the government is not taking any action though he has made several representations to the Centre in this regard. The central government has granted license to a joint venture of RIL and NICO for exploitation of natural resources of the KG basin. In the petition it was alleged that the JV has cheated the government by inflating the expenditure as there is a provision in the revenue-sharing agreement that RIL is entitled to recover all expenses before sharing it with the government. &amp;quot;Under the revenue-sharing agreement between the government and the JV, the JV is allowed to recover all costs before revenue is shared. The higher the cost of the JV, the revenue available to the government will be lower.

In the sense that your chemical refining margins depends more on what is happening globally and on the E&amp;amp;amp;P side I do not see any positive news at least for the next 12-15 months.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You will see production for the KG D-6 block that is somewhere about 45-48 cubic meters per day. The valuations have become fairly attractive, so the stock can bounce back 10-15% from current levels. If you look at sum of the parts valuation based on 2013 numbers we have Rs 1045, the stock is about Rs 780, so you have a fairly large upside over there.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;If you look at the valuations of the chemical refining portion that alone comes to about Rs 600 per share- add to that the value of investments, cash etc so by the end of 2013 this company should be sitting at about Rs 200 of cash in investment. The stock price is not discounting any value for E&amp;amp;amp;P part. I think that is the positive. If any positive surprise comes from the E&amp;amp;amp;P part, I think that will be taken very positively by the market.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Some of the short-term triggers, which the management can actually play a role could be if it steps out dividends or&amp;amp;nbsp;cancels treasury shares or does a buyback, I think that can sure up sentiments for the stock. Currently the company is&amp;amp;nbsp;sitting on large amount of cash and once it gets the BP money, USD 500 and it is generating a fair amount of cash flow, the best way to demonstrate confidence in the companies ability have too much of immediate capex just distribute the cash to shareholders and that would anyways provide some sort of support to the stock price.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Let us see what the management does. One of the things which can definitely do is cancel the treasury share. It makes no sense for the company to be hanging on to the treasury share at this point of time. The company has enough of cash, it does not have any great capex lined up, so it does not require the treasury shares and optically at least earnings numbers can look up smartly. For example if you are looking at Rs 65 EPS, if you cancel the treasury share then you would look at EPS which is closer to Rs 72 in which case the stock is trading at about 11 times and at least on a PE basis the stock starts looking attractive. It is just an optical thing but on a sentiment basis I think it is a positive move.&amp;quot;"

Industrialist Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries said in a statement that the completion of the deal has paved the way for commencement of its strategic alliance in India with BP. &amp;quot;This significant step will commence the planned alliance which will operate across the gas value chain in India, from exploration and production to distribution and marketing. Reliance Industries overtakes ONGC as most-valued company &amp;quot;The completion of the deal delivers one of the largest ever foreign direct investments into India,&amp;quot; RIL said. RIL will get USD 7.2 billion for the stake sale in 21 blocks and could get further USD 1.2 billion as performance payments based on exploration success resulting into development of commercial deliveries. Commenting on the completion of the deal, RIL Chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani said: &amp;quot;The alliance with BP will boost our efforts to realise the true potential of India's hydrocarbon reserves.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The globally renowned expertise of BP and the in-depth domestic experience of Reliance make for a formidable alliance which will deliver unparalleled value for the country in its pursuit of energy security,&amp;quot; he added. RIL said that the two companies would also form a 50-50 joint venture for sourcing and marketing of gas in India which will also accelerate the creation of infrastructure for receiving, transporting and marketing natural gas. BP Group CEO Bob Dudley said: &amp;quot;This major investment is directly aligned with our strategy of creating long-term value by forming alliances with strong national partners, gaining material positions in significant hydrocarbon basins and increasing our exposure to growing energy markets.&amp;quot; RIL is India's largest private sector company with a turnover of Rs 2,58,651 crore (USD 58 billion) and net profit of Rs 20,286 crore (USD 4.5 billion) in the last fiscal ended March 31, 2011. It had on February 21 agreed to sell 30% stake in 23 out of its 29 oil and gas blocks to BP. Earlier this month, the company said that it has received the government approval for sale of stake in 21 blocks. However, the approval has been held back for two blocks -- one a deep sea area off the Orissa coast and the other an onland block in Assam -- over technical issues. Regarding the two remaining blocks, valued at about USD 2.2 million, RIL said the discussions were continuing with the government and a decision was expected &amp;quot;at a later date&amp;quot;. RIL said the 21 blocks include the KG D6 block that produces about 1.7 billion cubic feet of gas per day, which was over 40% of India's total gas output. RIL would remain operator of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and BP will bring its global deepwater, sub-surface and gas expertise to enhance exploration and development of the blocks. The total value of the deal could rise to as much as USD 20 billion on the basis of future performance payments and investment and would give Reliance access to BP's expertise in deepwater drilling and accelerate development and production from its fields, particularly the KG-D6 block. RIL might also use BP's deepwater expertise to tackle the technical issues in the KG-D6 block. RIL is the operator in all 23 blocks, while Canadian firm Niko Resources and UK's Hardy Oil have minority 10% interest in a few. After the deal, RIL's holding in the blocks will come down to 60-70%. 19 out of the 23 blocks lie off the East Coast, while two blocks are in Assam and Gujarat. Niko has 10% interest in the KG-D6 block and after the BP deal, RIL's stake would fall to 60%. Besides KG-D6, RIL's second biggest discovery block is NEC-25, off the Orissa coast. It has so far made 15 exploratory successes in the block, where Niko holds a 10% stake. Following the BP deal, RIL's stake in this block will fall to 60%."

Reliance produced about 44.8 mmscmd of natural gas during the week ending August 14, according to the status report filed by the company with the oil ministry here. The output comprised 37.7 mmscmd from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields and 7.1 mmscmd from MA oil field in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. As per the status report, out of the 22 wells to be drilled in the Phase-I of Dhirubhai-1 and 3 field development plan, 18 wells have been drilled and completed so far. During August 8 to 14, 16 wells were put on production as two wells (B2 and B13) were kept closed due to high water cut. MA oilfield produced an average of 13,688 barrels of crude oil per day besides the 7.1 mmscmd of associated gas. Of the total 44.8 mmscmd, about 14.6 mmscmd of gas was sold to fertiliser plants and another 26.2 mmscmd to power plants. The remaining 4 mmscmd was consumed by other sectors like sponge iron plants, LPG, city gas distribution networks and petrochemical/refineries. Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singh had earlier this month informed Parliament that output from KG-D6 was short of 70.39 mmscmd envisaged by now as per the field development plan approved in 2006. &amp;quot;The contractor (Reliance) was advised by (oil regulator) DGH to expeditiously drill more development wells in D1 and D3 field as per FDP in order to enhance gas production in KG-DWN-98/3 block,&amp;quot; he had stated. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the committed 22 wells on D1 and D3 as reservoir has not performed on expected lines. Of the 20 wells drilled, only 18 wells are under production. Further in the FDP approved in 2006, Reliance had committed to drill 31 wells by end of current fiscal. Reliance currently holds 90% interest in KG-D6, while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling 30% in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for USD 7.2 billion. Reliance started natural gas production from KG-D6 fields from April 1, 2009. Its partner Niko had earlier this month stated that &amp;quot;declines (in production) are expected to continue until work-overs are completed and/or additional wells are tied-in&amp;quot;. The present output is less than about 60 mmscmd production in the same period a year-ago. "

Thereafter, a close race was seen between the two energy giants as they pipped each other several times within minutes. However, PSU giant ONGC emerged victorious at the end of the day with a higher market capitalisation than that of RIL. Marketmen would be keenly watching RIL and ONGC shares when trading resumes next week to see whether ONGC will manage to retain and extend its lead over RIL or the private sector corporate giant bounces back to reclaim its top position, as it did after losing out to CIL last week. ONGC's lead over RIL stands at a little over Rs 2,000 crore, which is barely about 1%. In a weak market, shares of both Reliance Industries and ONGC fell today, but losses were sharper for RIL. While RIL was weak for the entire day almost, ONGC could not sustain the gains witnessed earlier in the trading session. RIL shares closed 4.61% down at Rs 719.50, while ONGC fell 1.49% to Rs 278 at the BSE. At the end of yesterday's trade, RIL was the country's most-valued firm with a market valuation of Rs 246,965 crore, followed by ONGC's Rs 241,436 crore. Both the stocks are trading at their lowest levels in many months. Coal India, the third most valued company after ONGC and RIL, also fell sharply with a loss of 3.9% in its share price and commanded a market value of Rs 2,27,231 crore. ONGC, RIL and Coal India are followed by TCS, Bharti Airtel, ITC, NTPC, Infosys, SBI and HDFC Bank among the top 10 most valued companies. The top three have market values in excess of Rs two lakh crore, while others are valued above Rs one lakh crore each."

The firm has made 10 discoveries in the KG Basin's KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' showpiece producing KG-D6 gas fields, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas RPN Singh said today. &amp;quot;ONGC has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (and) Directorate General of Hydrocarbons requesting permission for drilling eight additional exploratory/appraisal wells in block KG-DWN-98/2 and also seeking an extension of the exploration period for drilling these wells,&amp;quot; he said a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha. The state-run firm estimates that the block holds an in-place volume of 25.61 million tonne of oil and 197 billion cubic metres of natural gas. It is proposing an investment of over USD 7.7 billion to produce up to 30 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the block. Singh said ONGC had submitted a proposal last year to declare its UD-1 ultra deep-sea gas discovery in the southern part of the block as commercial, a step toward developing the find. The Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) of the Northern area finds in the block were submitted by ONGC in July, 2010. &amp;quot;Since the said DoC was not approved at the Operating Committee (an oversight panel for the block), it could not be evaluated and the operator was asked to submit the OperatingCommittee-approved DoC,&amp;quot; he said. ONGC bought 90% interest in the block from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn still holds 10% in the block. Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area -- Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna). Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries -- E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1/KT-1 and the first ultra-deepwater discovery UD-1, at a record depth of 2,841 metres. The block is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U and A, while the ultra deep-sea UD find lies in the SDA. Don't miss: RIL sub-lets sole drilling rig to Malaysia's Petronas"

Reliance has sub-let its Transocean-owned ultra-deep water drillship Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2 to Petronas at least till the year-end, industry sources said. Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2, a high specification ultra-deep water drillship capable of operating in 12,000 feet of water and drilling to 35,000 feet, may drill two wells for Petronas off the coast of Brunei, beginning next month, which may take up to four months to complete. Following the move, Reliance does not have any operational offshore drilling rigs in Indian waters, sources said. Reliance had in March last year received Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2 from Transocean on a five-year contract at a day rate of USD 510,000, sources said, adding that the Mukesh Ambani-led firm is charging the same day rate from Petronas. A company spokesperson did not reply to an email sent for comments. Reliance has not drilled all of the wells it had committed in 2006 to win approval for investing up to USD 8.8 billion on its showpiece eastern offshore KG-D6 block. Natural gas production from the block, at 47 million cubic metres per day, is 31% less than the target, a phenomenon which the oil regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), says was on account of not drilling the required number of wells. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the 22 wells committed by March, 2011, in the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields of the KG-D6 block. As per its 2006 commitment, the number of producing wells should go up to 31 by the end of the current fiscal. Sources said without a drilling rig, it cannot drill any well this fiscal. The DGH wants Reliance to immediately take up drilling of the 11 committed wells so as to raise output, which had in March last year touched 61 mmcmd. Production has since late last year declined amid falling pressure in the wells. Reliance currently holds 90% interest in KG-D6, while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling a 30% stake in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for over USD 7 billion. In 2009, Reliance had sub-let another rig, Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-1, to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) at a dayrate of USD 495,000 to 510,000 for four years (about Rs 3,195 crore). ONGC was to pay a day rate of USD 495,000 to Reliance for the first 180 days and USD 510,000 from the 181st day onward."

Justice Khanna did not spell out the reasons for opting out of the hearing of the case. The court was hearing a petition filed by M Furquan, a journalist, seeking a direction of the court to the Centre for cancellation of licence granted to a Joint Venture (JV) of RIL and NICO in KG-D6 for exploration of natural resources. The petitioner also sought a direction to the Centre to take over the control and management of the Krishna-Godavari gas project immediately from the JV. He also said even after government auditor CAG reported &amp;quot;serious violation&amp;quot; of rules in KG basin, the government is not taking any action though he has made several representation to the Centre in this regard. &amp;quot;Even after CAG reported serious violation about KG basin contract, government is not taking any action ,&amp;quot; he said. In his petition, Furquan alleged the JV has cheated the government by inflating the expenditure as there is a provision in the revenue-sharing agreement that RIL is entitled to recover all expenses before sharing it with the government. &amp;quot;Under the revenue-sharing agreement between the government and JV, the JV is allowed to recover all costs before revenue is shared. The higher the cost of the JV, the revenue available to the government will be lower. By inflating the expenditure... JV has cheated the government and their licence is liable to be cancelled,&amp;quot; Furquan pleaded. The petitioner furhter said it is the duty of the government to ensure that the resources of the nation are being used in the best interest of citizens of India. &amp;quot;The Constitution of India envisages exploration, extraction and supply of gas to be within the domain of governmental function.

Shares of Coal India today slumped by 4.6% at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) to close at Rs 373.85, giving the company a market valuation of Rs 2,36,137 crore.  This made Coal India the third largest company in the country after RIL (Rs 2,49,142 crore) and ONGC (Rs 2,38,783 crore).  The stock performances of RIL and ONGC were relatively better in a weak market. As against a 1.3% decline in the benchmark Sensex, ONGC was nearly flat with a 0.02% decline to Rs 279.10, and RIL fell 0.6% to Rs 760.95. RIL yesterday regained its position as the country's most valued firm, pushing Coal India to second position, while ONGC was ranked third.  Coal India had dethroned RIL as the country's most valued firm on August 17. Since then, there have been many twists and turns in the market valuation charts, especially in the top three positions. Two days later on August 19, RIL briefly fell behind ONGC to third position in the market valuation charts, but returned to the second slot before the market close that day. However, Coal India shares have come under tremendous pressure in the past few days and in today's intra-day trade, it touched a low of Rs 371 -- its lowest in a week.  Coal India's market value has fallen by more than Rs 5,000 crore since August 17, when it became top-ranked company with a valuation of Rs 2,51,296 crore. At the same time, RIL's market value has risen by about Rs 2,000 crore even in an overall weak market in this period.  ONGC's market value has also grown by about Rs 1,500 crore since August 17. When Coal India topped RIL on August 17 to emerge as the country's most valued firm, it had ended the private sector corporate giant's over four-year reign at the top of the market valuation charts. RIL had first toppled ONGC to become the country's most valued firm way back in late 2006, but the state-run energy giant later reclaimed its top position, albeit only for a brief period.

The decision follows an exploratory drilling campaign that failed to unearth any significant prospects, the Oman Daily Observer report said. The move comes six years after Reliance inked a deepwater Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement with the Oman government for Block 18 in the Sohar Basin in June, 2005.

In conjunction with the farm-out agreement, OOCEP also signed a Joint Operating Agreement with Reliance, which provided the basis for setting up a joint operating company to be managed by the two companies upon a commercial discovery being established in Block 18.

At the end of today's trade, Reliance Industries (RIL) commanded a market value of Rs 2,50,648 crore on the BSE, higher than any other listed company in the country. In the process, RIL moved past Coal India, which had dethroned RIL as the country's most valued firm on August 17, on the market valuation charts. RIL shares today rose by 1.23%, outperforming a little below one per cent rise in the benchmark index Sensex, to settle at Rs 765.55. At the same time, shares of Coal India under-performed the overall uptrend in the market and ended 0.9% down at Rs 391.90. This brought down the state-run coal major's market valuation to Rs 2,47,538 crore. Earlier in the day, CIL had even slipped below ONGC to the third position in market valuation charts, but PSU energy giant lost ground in the afternoon trade and its shares ended the day at Rs 279.15 with a 2.65% decline -- the maximum for any Sensex stock in today's trade. ONGC had a market valuation of Rs 2,38,826 crore at the end of today's trade, making it the country's third most valued company after RIL and CIL. In late morning trade, the shares of all three -- RIL, CIL and ONGC -- were trading in the red and losses were much sharper for the coal major. At 1145 hrs, RIL had the top market value of Rs 2,46,507 crore on the BSE, followed by ONGC's Rs 2,42,847 crore and CIL's Rs 2,41,822 crore. While RIL was down 0.44% at Rs 752.90, ONGC was 1.01% down at Rs 283.85 and CIL was trading 3.15% lower at Rs 382.85 at that time. However, RIL rebounded sharply in afternoon trade, CIL also pared some of its losses and ONGC lost further ground. At the end of yesterday's trade, Coal India was ranked the most valued company with a market capitalisation of Rs 249,685.88 crore, followed by RIL's 249,685.88 crore and ONGC's 245,328.68 crore.

Two days later on August 19, RIL briefly fell behind ONGC to the third position in the market valuation charts, but returned to the second slot before the market close that day. CIL and ONGC have been closing the gap on RIL in terms of market valuation for the past few weeks, as RIL's stock has been under selling pressure and the two PSUs have been mostly performing well even in a weak market. However, a sharp rally in RIL stock for two trading sessions and today's fall in CIL shares helped the private sector corporate giant regain its lead over the coal major. RIL had first toppled ONGC to become the country's most valued firm way back in late 2006, but the state-run energy giant later reclaimed its top position, albeit only for a brief period. RIL has managed to stay on the top since February, 2007, except for the past few days. The recent bout of volatility in stock market has led to many upheavals in the market valuation charts. Coal India and ONGC had come very close to challenging RIL's top-position last month also, while the rankings of other top-10 companies have also undergone many changes in the recent past. IT major Infosys, which once figured among the top-five companies, has now slipped to the ninth position, while ICICI Bank has moved out of the top-10 to 11th slot. At the same time, ITC has moved to the fifth position. In the top-10, RIL is now followed by Coal India, ONGC, TCS, ITC, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, SBI, Infosys and HDFC Bank. Out of these, the top-three have market value in excess of Rs two lakh crore, while the others carry a valuation of more than Rs 1 lakh crore."

In June, the oil ministry came under criticism from the state auditor for what it said was allowing some exploring companies to overstate costs of field developments and exploring beyond their contracted areas. The Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) draft report said energy major Reliance Industries had inflated development costs on its D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin and cited a joint venture of Reliance with BG and ONGC for hiking development costs in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti gas fields. Reliance is already facing criticism for pumping less gas than it should from the key D6 block, one of the biggest gas producing blocks in India. &amp;quot;PM will take a review meeting soon but no definite date is known to us,&amp;quot; the Economic Times quoted an unnamed oil ministry official as saying. It said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will also assess the performance of state-run oil companies, some of which have posted losses in the first quarter of the current year. He is also expected to review the burgeoning fuel subsidy bill and delays in key appointments to state oil firms, the report said. The possible review by the prime minister comes at a time when his coalition's political capital is being sapped by popular protests against government corruption."

Reliance, owned by Mukesh Ambani, the world's ninth richest man, saw its crown seized by Coal India, the world's largest coal miner, whose stock in energy-hungry India is the best performer this year on the country's top index. Reliance has been under fire over the past few months from the upstream regulator, investors and analysts due to slowing gas output, sending its shares down over 29% this year, compared to an almost 19% fall in the main index. Analysts on Thursday talked down the chances of RIL retaining its top spot in the near future, due to Coal India's surging growth outlook and margin worries across Reliance's other sectors, such as refining and petrochemical production. Fund manager JP Morgan Asset Management halved its holding in Reliance between March and June this year. BlackRock Asset Management have reduced its position by nearly 29% between March and April, according to Thomson Reuters StreetSight. UTI Asset Management has cut its positions in Reliance while increasing its holding in Coal India. The two companies are separated only by a thread. As of mid-day trade on Thursday, Reliance had a market cap of Rs 2.45 trillion (USD 54 billion) while Coal India's market cap stood at Rs 2.49 trillion (USD 55 billion). Coal heats up State-owned Coal India has surged in Asia's third-largest economy, which aims to halve its peak-hour power deficit of nearly 14% in two years by ramping up generation. The miner accounts for nearly 80% of India's coal output. The Kolkata-based miner has seen its shares rise over 25% this year, after the Indian government sold a 10-percent stake for USD 3.4 billion in the country's largest IPO ever last November. Templeton Asset Management, Blackstone Group and Allianz Global Investors are among funds that have expanded their portfolios to include Coal India since April, according to Thomson Reuters StreetSight.  India is likely to import 135 million tonnes of coal this fiscal year, to meet a forecasted 11% rise in demand, and Coal India is in talks for acquisitions in Indonesia, Australia and the United States.  Reliance, which became India's largest company by market capitalization in February 2007, is looking to expand beyond its core businesses into telecom, financial services and in June said it planned to invest aggressively in retail. Results from the fiscal first quarter showed a 16.7% rise in net profit last month, but analysts cautioned of a peak in refining margins and predicted further slowdown in its oil and gas business, which already lag estimates.  In May, India's upstream regulator called on Reliance to drill two extra wells this fiscal to meet gas production targets at a flagship block off the country's east coast. "

ONGC yesterday signed a seven-year contract with Forbes Bumi Armada Offshore Ltd (FBAOL) - a joint venture between Malaysia's Bumi Armada and BSE-listed Forbes &amp;amp;amp; Co Ltd - for hiring a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO), officials said here. Reliance Industries has been using a FPSO since September, 2008, to produce oil from its MA field in the predominantly gas-rich KG-D6 block off the East Coast. Bumi owns a 49.99% stake in the joint venture that has leased the FPSO to ONGC, while the remaining 50.01% is held by Forbes. Officials said this was the first time ever that ONGC has hired a FPSO to produce oil. Till now, it has been using fixed platforms standing in the middle of the sea to produce oil from offshore fields. A FPSO is a converted or custom-built ship-shaped floater used to process oil and gas and for temporary storage of oil prior to transshipment. The FPSO processes oil coming from undersea wells and stores it before transferring it for sale to refineries for processing. ONGC has hired the FPSO for a seven-year fixed term time charter, with a further six-year annual extension period at ONGC's discretion. The FPSO will have a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels per day and 580,000 barrels storage capacity. The D1 field lies about 200 kilometres off the coast of Mumbai in a water depths ranging from 85 to 90 metres and is currently producing 16,000 bpd of oil through the Sagar Laxmi jack-up-based early production system (EPS). The field was developed in two phases. Phase-I development was completed in 2006-07 by drilling seven wells, while Phase-II development was completed in 2008-09 by drilling the remaining five wells. Peak oil production of 17,500 barrels per day was achieved from the field after Phase-II development. Presently, the field is producing approximately 16,000 bpd."

RIL had on July 31 taken a 12-day maintenance shutdown to upgrade a compressor in the Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit operating on the MA oilfield. The upgrade was completed on Tuesday and today the field is back to its normal production level, industry sources said. MA oilfield produces a little less than 15,000 barrels per day of oil and about 7.6 million standard cubic meters per day of natural gas from the five wells. Gas output was shutdown completely for only one day, they said adding production was down about 3 mmscmd during the rest of the period. The wells had not been shutdown and they continued to produce at almost normal rate, sources said. KG-D6 block, which besides MA oilfield, also includes the gigantic Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) gas fields, is producing near normal levels of about 46 mmscmd of gas today. Sources said the maintenance work was to last 12-14 days and gas production from MA field was to be shut for 36-48 hours. But the shutdown period had been curtailed and the field was back to normal a day ahead of the schedule. Sources said wells in the MA field had not been shutdown during the maintenance of FPSO, which pumps out oil from the field. The wells continued to produce oil and gas. The Krishna Godavari basin Block KG-DWN-98/3 (D6) has 19 oil and gas finds. Of these, the largest, Dhirubhai-1 and 3 finds and an oil field, MA, have been put into production. The present output is just enough to meet the contracted demand of core sectors - 15.35 mmscmd of fertiliser units, 29 mmscmd of power plants, 0.65 mmscmd of city gas distribution firms and 2.59 mmscmd to LPG plants. Sources said in May, the oil ministry had directed that production from KG-D6 will first go to meet the contracted demand of core users. If any gas is left after that, it can go to non-core sectors like petrochemicals, refineries and steel. In event of output falling below what has been allocated to core users, fuel will first be supplied to fertiliser plants to their full requirement, then to LPG plants, power and lastly to city gas users.

The present output is made up of about 8 mmscmd from the MA oil field in the predominately gas-rich KG-D6 block off the Andhra coast.

Singh however did not mention if Reliance has complied with the direction of drilling more wells. He also did not say what action the government could take in case of default. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the committed 22 wells on D1 and D3 as reservoir has not performed on expected lines. Pressure in the wells has dropped sharply and there is an increased water ingress, resulting in lower per-well gas output. Of the 20 wells drilled, only 18 wells are under production. Further in the FDP approved in 2006, Reliance had committed to drill 31 wells by end of current fiscal. Reliance currently holds 90% interest in KG-D6 while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling 30% in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for over USD 7 billion. To a separate question, Singh said an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) had in September 2007, after considering the price proposal submitted by Reliance-Niko, approved a price formula for gas produced from KG-D6 for five years from date of commencement of supply. &amp;quot;The price obtained from the basis/formula (approved by EGoM) comes to USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit for crude oil price (if it is) equal or greater than USD 60 per barrel,&amp;quot; he said.

Furthermore, the CAG report said the development plan Reliance submitted for Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, was not in compliance with the PSC and the ministry and the DGH turned a blind eye to the company raising capital expenditure without having begun work on the previous plan.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, today approved BP buying stake in RIL's 21 blocks, sources said. The CCEA could not meet on its scheduled day yesterday as the oil ministry had not circulated the agenda in time. RIL, India's most valuable company, had on February 21 agreed to sell 30% stake in 23 out of its 29 oil and gas blocks to London-based BP Plc for USD 7.2 billion, and may get an additional USD 1.8 billion if the two explorers find more hydrocarbons. The CCEA approved sale of stake only 21 blocks as exploration status in the two remaining blocks was in dispute. BP will have to furnish a bank guarantee and performance guarantee as has been prescribed under the production sharing contract. The deal, that may increase to USD 20 billion with future performance payments and investment, will give Reliance access to BP's expertise in deep-water drilling and accelerate development and production at its fields particularly the under-performing eastern offshore KG-D6. For BP, which has been struggling to battle back from the disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil-spill disaster last year, the transaction is a chance to enter a market where energy demand is growing at 5-8%. Officials said Reliance had on February 25 applied for government nod for the stake sale. New Exploration Licencing Policy, under which Reliance had won the oil and gas blocks, allowed for sale or assignment of participating interest(farm-out), which is routinely approved by the oil ministry. But the ministry, even though competent to approve the deal, decided to refer it to the CCEA. Reliance may use BP's deepwater expertise to tackle the technical issues in the sub-surface of KG-D6 block. Dhirubhai-1 and -3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block have seen output falling to 39 million cubic meters per day from 50 mmscmd achieved in March last year. Reliance has been forced to restrict oil production from the MA field, in the same area, to about 15,000 barrels per day due to high water and gas cut. Together with 8 mmscmd of gas produced from MA field, KG-D6 block in the week ended July 10 produced 46.8 mmscmd as against 61.5 msmcmd in March last year. As per projections, the output should have risen to 69 mmscmd by now. Besides addressing the reservoir issues in KG-D6, BP is expected to help Reliance quickly put into production 9 satellite gas discoveries, for which Reliance has been struggling to piece together a viable development plan. While the Europe's second biggest oil firm will pay USD 7.2 billion in three tranches in FY12, some analysts said Reliance will not be liable to any income tax on the receipts. The USD 7.2 billion deal is seen as the biggest FDI into India. Other proposed big transaction -- Posco's USD 12 billion investment announced years ago for a steel plant in Orissa -- is yet to take off. Reliance is the operator in all the 23 blocks while Canadian Niko Resources and UK's Hardy Oil have minority 10% interest in a few. After the deal, Reliance holding in the blocks will come down to 60-70%. 19 out of 23 blocks lie off the east coast while two blocks are onland in Assam and Gujarat. Reliance currently produces about 47.5 mmscmd of natural gas from its mainstay KG-D6 fields off the Andhra coast. Niko Resources of Canada has 10% interest in the block and after the BP deal, Reliance's stake would fall to 60%. Besides KG-D6, Reliance's second biggest discovery block is NEC-25 in the Mahanadi basis off the Orissa coast. It has so far made 15 exploratory success in the block, where Niko holds 10% stake. Post BP deal, Reliance stake in thisblock too will fall to 60%. Reliance has potential resource of 9.5 Tcf in KG-D3 block. Hardy has 10% in the block and Reliance 90%.  Besides, it has made oil discoveries in Cambay onland block. In KG-D6 block, Reliance has so far made 19 oil and gas discoveries, of which it has put two gas - Dhirubhai-1 and 3, and one oil find - MA - into production. It had in 2008 submitted development plan for nine satellite gas discoveries around Dhirubhai-1 and 3. It in 2009 withdrew this and submitted an optimised development plan for prioritising four satellite gas finds to oil regulator DGH. An integrated development plan for all gas discoveries in the block KG-D6 is being conceptualised to maximise capital efficiency and accelerate monetisation. The BP deal is a clear breakthrough for Mukesh Ambani, 53, in terms of getting access to BP's expertise as well as de-risking its exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) portfolio. Reliance and BP will also form a 50:50 joint venture for the sourcing and marketing of gas in India. The JV will also work towards creation of infrastructure for receiving, transporting and marketing of natural gas in India which could be in the form of an LNG terminal. BP acquires 30% stake in 23 of the 29 blocks that Reliance has in India (excluding the older Panna/Mukta and Tapti (PMT) fields and the domestic coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks). It will take stake in 19 blocks (18 deepwater and 1 shallow water) in the eastern offshore. This include the deepwater KG-D6 and NEC-25 blocks, in which commercial discoveries have been made; 2 deep water Kerala-Konkan blocksand 2 onland blocks including the Cambay blocks in which Reliance has made several oil discoveries. Reliance was awarded a total of 43 blocks to date from the pre-NELP and eight NELP rounds. 14 of these blocks have been relinquished by 1QFY11. Out of the 29 blocks remaining, there have been discoveries in nine blocks. The firm names its discoveries in numerical order. The first was called D1 (after its founder Dhirubhai Ambani) and 52 discoveries have been made to date. Of these, four have been made in the overseas Yemen block (which is producingsmall quantities) and one in a block that has since been relinquished. So, 47 discoveries have been made in nine NELP blocks. 19 of these discoveries related to KG-D6. New deepwater gas discoveries will be expensive to develop relative to the D1/D3 field reserves within KG-D6, which are already producing. Hence, new discoveries would need a higher gas price than is currently being charged for the D6 gas (USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit). Reliance also has 30% interest in the producing pre-NELP blocks PMT. It also has 5 CBM blocks in India including two, with gas resource of 3.5 Tcf. Reliance has also recently formed three US Shale gas JVs. BP will not take interest in any of these E&amp;amp;amp;P assets of Reliance. Reliance is the largest integrated oil and gas company in India. Its three main business are exploration and production, refining and petrochemicals. Its two refineries in Jamnagar, Gujarat have among the highest complexity globally and a combined capacity of 1 million barrels per day."

BP had in February announced buying 30% stake in 23 blocks of Reliance, including prolific KG Basin block D6 and gas discovery block NEC-25. While Reliance made an application for transfer of interest on February 25, Oil Ministry earlier this month sent the proposal to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for approval. Sources said law ministry in its comments on Cabinet note raised the issue of the two blocks, where the Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH) and Reliance are in disagreement over exploration status. In NEC-DWN-2002/1, Reliance had taken an extension of Phase-I of its exploration campaign. In the meanwhile, the government recently announced rig moratorium, allowing firm more time to fulfill their drilling commitments which they had previously not met due to global shortage of drilling rigs. Since NEC-DWN-2002/1 was covered by rig moratorium, Reliance sought to withdraw the exploration extension it had availed as per the exploration extension policy of the government but DGH and oil ministry said no to it, sources said adding it is not clear if the block in now under Phase-1 or Phase-II of the exploration phase. In Assam block AS-ONN-2000/1, there is disagreement if Reliance had completed its Phase-I work programme and entered Phase-II. While Reliance had drilled a well on NEC-DWN-2002/1, it was planning to do so on Assam block shortly. The well on NEC-DWN-2002/1 was dry i.e. did not lead to any oil or gas find. Sources said finance ministry has opined that approval to the Reliance-BP deal may be given unconditionally while the comments of the Home Ministry are awaited. If Home Ministry responds by Monday, the oil ministry will the following day send a detailed cabinet note complying view of ministries of finance, law and home. The deal may then come up for deliberation of the CCEA on July 21, they said. Home Ministry had previously given a security clearance to the USD 7.2 billion deal. Sources said the two blocks on which CCEA may give some kind of a conditional approval, are inconsequential in the whole transaction as there has not been any hydrocarbon discovery so far."

Replying to a draft audit report of the CAG, which said that the increase in field cost would mean a lower profit take for the government, Reliance said, &amp;quot;It has set a benchmark for the lowest project costs across the world.&amp;quot; Its cost estimates for producing gas from the deepsea KG-D6 block are the lowest even in comparison to shallow water projects. &amp;quot;Oil and Natural Gas Corp's block KG-D5 in vicinity, with a discovery made in 2001, has 1.9 tcf of gas reserves with an estimated development cost of USD 7.7 billion, for which a development plan is under preparation. &amp;quot;Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's (GSPC) shallow water block in the same basin, which had a discovery in 2003, is estimated to cost USD 2 billion to develop 1.4 tcf,&amp;quot; it said.  ONGC's KG-D5 block sits next to Reliance's KG-D6 area, where the first discovery was made in 2002. While Reliance took six years to bring KG-D6 gas on to production, even after 10 years of the first discovery, ONGC has not yet been able to put together a development plan. Reliance said the allegations that government revenue interests have been affected by the 'gold-plating' are completely false. The New Exploration Licencing Policy, under which Reliance had won the KG-D6 block in 2000, brought an end to the 'cost plus regime', where firms got a fixed return on all the capital they invested. Under NELP, a contractor like Reliance &amp;quot;never benefits by an increase in costs,&amp;quot; it said, adding it was imperative to view the revenue interest of the government from the point of view of the contribution of the project to the nation. &amp;quot;Needless to say, inspite of all the noise, the draft CAG report has found nothing to suggest that Reliance indulged in 'gold-plating' viz that Reliance placed orders on its own affiliates at inflated costs or that payments made to vendors came back to Reliance,&amp;quot; the voluminous 250-page response said.

Without naming anyone, it said &amp;quot;baseless insinuations were made through public advertisements questioning the increase in cost estimates&amp;quot; from USD 2.4 billion proposed in 2004 to USD 8.8 billion in 2006 due to a 250 per cent jump in the cost of services between the period of initial assessment and the actual commencement of field development.

The CAG, it said, had focused on &amp;quot;a series of minor, and in some cases trivial, observations concerning the procurement activities&amp;quot; for development of the D1-D3 gas fields and the MA oilfield in the KG-D6 block. Its observations on the &amp;quot;reasonableness&amp;quot; of the cost incurred relate to procurement contracts whose total value is Rs 1,500 crore out of the total investment of Rs 35,000 crore in the block.

Besides Reliance, Cairn India and UK's BG Group too replied to audit observations on Rajasthan oilfields and Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields respectively at the Exit Conference called by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) before finalising its report, sources privy to meetings said. Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) Director General S K Srivastava in a separate session with CAG said the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) allowed companies to revise costs and plans for developing oil and gas finds. This is by incorporating new inputs like the one done by Reliance for its KG-D6 fields where cost went up from USD 2.4 billion initially proposed to USD 8.8 billion in two phases (USD 5.2 billion in Phase-1 and USD 3.6 billion in phase-II). The initial cost produced in 2004 was for producing a maximum of 40 million standard cubic meters per day but in the revised plans, Reliance doubled output to 80 mmscmd. &amp;quot;Financial estimates were best estimates at that point of time for the broad work programme considered in development plan and were used for techno economic evaluation only,&amp;quot; DGH said. CAG in the draft report had accused oil ministry and DGH of turning a blind eye to the cost increase which would lower government's profit take from the field. Sources said DGH disagreed with CAG assumption of adverse impact on government's financial take from the project saying &amp;quot;cost for the purpose of computation of government take is determined based on actual expenditure incurred and duly validated by audit, and is not based on development plan estimates&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Any expenditure qualified by audit will be disallowed as contract cost,&amp;quot; it said adding Reliance's actual expenditure on Phase-1 of KG-D6 gas field development is USD 5.6 billion till March 2011. Second phase of drilling is scheduled to commence shortly. A Reliance team headed by its Executive Director PMS Prasad pointed that &amp;quot;the draft CAG report had found nothing to suggest that Reliance indulged in gold-plating viz that Reliance placed orders on its own affiliates at inflated costs or that payments made to vendors came back to Reliance&amp;quot;. Sources said Reliance stated that &amp;quot;using the benefit of hindsight, CAG cannot question the technical and operational judgements of the operator that were in effect the best possible judgements at that time based on the best information available. Benchmarking the project with similar ones the world over validates the fact that KG-D6 remains the most cost effective project.&amp;quot; Reliance said there was &amp;quot;no malafide intent&amp;quot; on its part in making any &amp;quot;economic, commercial or operational decisions&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Reasonableness of costs incurred cannot be established on the basis of hindsight. Any increase in the investment only increases the risk exposure of the operator without giving any additional benefits,&amp;quot; it added. The company presented nearly 250 page reply to the CAG draft audit while DGH put up another 180 pages to support its decisions which it described as in the interest of the country and the companies.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  Sources said the private operators criticised CAG for exceeding its brief and converting the Special Audit into a Performance Audit. Any audit has to be done under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) which provides for the legal regime under which the companies have to operate.  If audits like that done by CAG were to go beyond the PSC, there would be no legal protection left for the companies, they said. Sources said Reliance took almost 100 minutes to explain its point while Cairn did it n less than 30 minutes. BG took an equal amount of time. CAG in its June 7 draft report stated that the oil ministry and its technical arm DGH favoured private firms like Reliance and Cairn India by allowing them to retain entire exploration acreage, turning a blind eye to increase in&amp;amp;nbsp; capital expenditure and giving additional area in violation of Production Sharing Contract (PSC). Sources said DGH urged CAG to focus in its final report on accounting issues with quantification so as to ensure that revenue and expenditure reported in the books of accounts reflect a true and fair view in line with the accounting principles. Also, procurement of goods and services should be viewed in the light of the common commercial practices prevailing in the private sector, that distinguishes the performance of private sector and may not be unduly shadowed by the systems and procedures of PSU, it said. On pure technical issues, the CAG audit should rely on the judgement of the technical arm of the oil ministry for drawing conclusions in view of the fact that exploration and production complexity is not easily comprehensible. &amp;quot;The CAG's final comment should encourage enhanced inflow of private and foreign capital and technology,&amp;quot; DGH stated. CAG may take two months to finalise its final report which would be tabled in Parliament."

Coal India Ltd (CIL) fell sharply on heavy sell-offs in metals and mining firms after the Centre cleared a draft bill proposing that they share profits with the people displaced by their projects or pay them royalty.  CIL valuation dipped Rs 13,927.58 crore to Rs 2,28,652.23 crore, pulling it down to the fourth position from the second after Reliance Industries as on July 1. ONGC sailed past TCS, which was at the third position, to capture the CIL spot in the overall ranking as of last Friday.  CIL was also the biggest loser among the country's top-10 firms. It tanked nearly 6% during the week to end at Rs 362. On Friday alone, the scrip plunged 8.12%.  Last week, a ministerial panel, headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee , approved the proposed Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Bill, 2011, according to which coal miners would have to share 26 per cent of their profits and non-coal miners will have to pay 100% royalty to the projects-affected people.  ONGC managed to regain the second spot after nearly two months. However, despite grabbing the coveted CIl position, ONGC saw a minor dip of Rs 85.55 crore from its m-cap, which stood at Rs 2,36,302.36 crore.  RIL continued to rule the chart despite shedding Rs 2,510.72 crore from its valuation, at Rs 2,79,740.81 crore.  IT major TCS, FMCG giant ITC and top private lender ICICI Bank were the other companies that saw m-cap losses.  TCS saw its valuation declining by Rs 2,906.44 crore to Rs 2,29,285.98 crore, while ITC lost Rs 1,122.03 crore from its m-cap which stood at Rs 1,54,955.45 crore. Similarly, ICICI's valuation declined by Rs 3,993.34 crore to Rs 1,22,120.48 crore.  In contrast, Infosys Technologies , SBI, NTPC and Bharti Airtel witnessed gains.  IT bellwether Infosys added Rs 2,503.42 crore to take its m-cap to Rs 1,70,985.06 crore, while country's biggest lender SBI saw its valuation swelling by Rs 3,654.37 crore to Rs 1,57,391.8 crore.  Power producer NTPC added Rs 3,215.73 crore, to reach Rs 1,56,581.29 crore m-cap, while Bharti's valuation surged by Rs 5,563.37 crore to Rs 1,51,179.27 crore.  Bharti last week unveiled major restructuring of its India and South Asia operations, combining various segments, including mobile and digital TV into two separate business units to improve efficiency.

Reliance Executive Director PMS Prasad on June 29 wrote to Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi protesting that his firm has not received the full copy of the draft CAG report and was never consulted on many issues pointed in the reports. &amp;quot;...the subject matter of many of the observations being reported does not seem to have constituted the substance of any of the audit memos we had received from the CAG team during the audit of KG-DWN-98/3 (or KG-D6) block at our premises between December 2009 to September 2010. &amp;quot;Needless to say neither were any of these issues raised by CAG during our brief conference with the CAG team on June 4,&amp;quot; he said in the letter. A spokesperson of CAG could not be reached for comments. CAG's June 7 draft report said the oil ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, favoured Reliance by turning a blind eye to the Mukesh Ambani firm increasing capital expenditure on its flagship KG-D6 gas fields and allowed it to retain entire exploration acreage in violation of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs). &amp;quot;All observations that are of material consequence to us as a contractor, and affect our rights as well as obligations under the PSC, need to be responded to by us in the interest of fair play and natural justice, particularly in relation tothose observations in respect of which no memo was received by us during audit, seeking our comments,&amp;quot; Prasad wrote. Oil Ministry too had in a June 22 letter to CAG raised the issue of CAG not seeking comments from private firms like Reliance and Cairn India before before levying a series of allegations. &amp;quot;In the interactive meeting (CAG had with firms before submitting the draft report) one of the operators gave a presentation on how the project was executed and no audit observations were discussed. In the other meeting, only one observation was discussed with the operator,&amp;quot; it wrote. &amp;quot;The operators were not given any draft report before this meeting so that they could have come prepared with some reply,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote. Prasad in the June 29 letter stressed that the process of giving contractors an opportunity to respond to any audit objection before preparation of the draft report was not followed. The Oil Ministry asked the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to now give the private operators a chance to present their views. &amp;quot;The contractors have seen and replied to the audit requisitions and memos only. They have not been given the draft report, which has the response to audit queries and observation of the CAG,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote. The ministry cited provisions of the PSC signed with firms like Reliance to state that seeking comments on audit observations was a must. &amp;quot;Any audit exception shall (have to) be made available by the government in writing to the contractor within 120 days following completion of the audit in question and thereafter, the contractor shall answer within 120 days of receipt of such notice,&amp;quot; it wrote. Prasad said it &amp;quot;would be against the rules of natural justice if observations on issues on which we have not been heard are retained in the report without giving us sufficient opportunity to present the facts of the case.&amp;quot; Reliance sought &amp;quot;suitable opportunity&amp;quot; of being heard on the issues and till such time &amp;quot;references to issues on which we have not been accorded an opportunity of being heard may kindly be withheld.&amp;quot; In the draft report, the CAG said rules were bent, enabling Reliance to retain the entire 7,645-square kilometre KG-D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, off the East Coast. Also, the development plan Reliance submitted for Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, was not in compliance with the PSC and the ministry and the DGH turned a blind eye to the company raising capital expenditure without having begun work on the previous plan. Reliance had in May, 2004, proposed an investment of USD 2.4 billion for producing 40 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the D1 and D3 fields and later, in October, 2006, moved an addendum to this saying USD 5.2 billion would be required in Phase-1 to produce 80 mmscmd of gas and another USD 3.3 billion to sustain the peak output for a longer duration. The CAG, however, did not say Reliance overbilled the government or caused a loss to the exchequer with the increase in development cost. &amp;quot;The increase in cost from Initial Development Plan (IDP) to Addendum to IDP is likely to have significant adverse impact on government of India's financial take. However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unableto comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise, of the increase in cost from IDP to AIDP, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; it said."

Harrisons Malayalam, which is also a major tea grower, is joining a surge in outbound investment by corporate India. It plans to spend up to USD 112 million somewhere in Africa to buy about 10,000 acres. The overseas investment push by Indian companies, often seen as the assertiveness of a rising power, is increasingly spurred by difficulty finding attractive opportunities in Asia's third-largest economy. &amp;quot;Plantation land in India is very scarce and the competition is intense for the little that is available,&amp;quot; said Harrisons Malayalam Managing Director Pankaj Kapoor. &amp;quot;So all the plantation companies are looking at Africa where it is still available and cheap.&amp;quot; At home, rising interest rates and inflation, fierce competition in several industries, and policy gridlock amid a spate of corruption scandals that have put India's government on the defensive have deterred investment, slowing economic growth and prompting many Indian firms to seek opportunity elsewhere. While doing business abroad diversifies risk and opens new markets, the export of capital even as inflows slow deprives the Indian economy of investment that could add capacity and ease bottlenecks that drive inflation and crimp growth.   Inorganic growth India Inc.'s increasingly global focus also makes it harder for equity investors to gain exposure directly to the country's consumption-driven growth, with roughly one-third to half of revenue generated by firms in the 50-share Nifty index coming from overseas, even though exports account for just 18% of India's economy. &amp;quot;Despite India's vast opportunities across under-penetrated sectors, companies are venturing abroad for inorganic growth,&amp;quot; HDFC Securities analyst Anupam Gupta wrote in a recent report. &amp;quot;While this is also partly driven by rising global aspirations for Indian companies, another reason for this is a tough competitive field, made no easier by the unpredictable regulatory environment,&amp;quot; he wrote. Foreign direct investment (FDI) by Indian firms more than doubled in the fiscal year that ended in March to USD 44 billion. At the same time, inbound FDI fell by a quarter to USD 19.4 billion, with planned multibillion-dollar investments by South Korean steelmaker POSCO and London-listed India-focused miner Vedanta Resources plagued by delays. Within India, investment was flat on an annual basis in January-March after growing 7.8% in the previous quarter. Indian firms have made several big-ticket overseas buys in recent years, and the huge Reliance Industries and Tata conglomerates earn more than half their revenue abroad. However, the recent mismatch in inbound and outbound investment suggests push factors are increasingly at play. &amp;quot;To a certain extent there is a perception within the private sector of policy drift domestically,&amp;quot; said Frank Hancock, managing director for advisory at Barclays in India. &amp;quot;As a result some corporates are factoring in a higher degree of political risk for making investments at home than abroad,&amp;quot; said Hancock, who advised Indian mobile giant Bharti Airtel in its USD 9 billion purchase last year of most of Kuwait-based Zain's African operations.   Opportunity and frustration With an economy growing around 8% a year, 1.2 billion people and unmet demand for everything from housing, roads and power to food and consumer goods, India is hungry for capital. Conditions on the ground, however, can make it hard to put money to work. The fast-growing telecoms sector is beset by uncertainty stemming from a massive licensing scandal that has seen several executives held in jail and put the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the back foot over its handling of corruption. Already, telecom was ferociously competitive. &amp;quot;What does Bharti's move into Africa tell you? It tells you that the Indian market is saturated probably,&amp;quot; said David Cornell, Mumbai-based director at fund manager India Advisory Partners (IAP), which targets domestically-focused Indian firms. Securing land for big projects is fraught with problems. Mining and power companies can't dig the coal and other raw materials they need because of a slowdown in environmental clearances, sending them in search of resources in Australia, Indonesia and elsewhere. Even state-run Coal India, the world's biggest coal miner, missed production targets, in part because tighter environmental rules kept it from gaining access to new domestic mines, adding urgency to its hunt for mining assets abroad. In some cases, companies have permits but can't start mining. Indian home and personal care goods makers Godrej Consumer Products, Dabur India Ltd and Marico are searching for buys in Africa amid fierce competition inside India. Even with a severe infrastructure deficit at home, Indian builders of roads and power plants are active overseas. Hyderabad-based GVK Power &amp;amp;amp; Infrastructure Ltd in January signed a memorandum of understanding to invest USD 3 billion to USD 5 billion to build airports on the Indonesian islands of Bali and Java. For India's infrastructure builders, &amp;quot;the fact that they're looking for opportunities overseas highlights the policy paralysis that exists here,&amp;quot; said IAP's Cornell.  Sentiment setback India's economy grew at a 7.8% annual pace in January-March, its slowest in five quarters and well below forecasts. The central bank has raised interest rates 10 times since March 2010, which has taken a toll on sentiment among companies and investors. Mumbai stocks are among the world's worst performers this year, with the Sensex down more than 8%. Foreign portfolio investors have put a net USD 494 million into Indian stocks in 2011, well off the record pace of last year, which ended with USD 29.3 billion in net fund inflows. Few question India's attractiveness as a long-term bet. Local auto makers Maruti Suzuki and Hero Honda Motors and global giants like Ford and Hyundai Motor are adding capacity in an Indian car market that grew 30% in the fiscal year that ended in March. Near-term sentiment is weaker. Three-quarters of leading firms have lost faith in the government and believe a governance crisis and policy limbo will hit economic growth and their investment plans, a recent survey found.  Saurabh Mukherjea, head of equities at Ambit Capital in Mumbai, said rising domestic competition is a bigger driver of outbound investment than policy gridlock, which combined with inflation is more of a deterrent for foreign investors. &amp;quot;I think our reputation as a country to put money in has taken a knock because of the state of our governance -- I don't think there is any two ways about it,&amp;quot; Mukherjea said. More importantly, he said, governance issues and the policy gridlock are hitting economic growth, which is &amp;quot;softening quite meaningfully at the moment.&amp;quot;"

Although the Oil Ministry has the authority to decide on Reliance selling 30% interest to BP in 23 exploration blocks, including the prize eastern offshore KG-D6 gas fields, the ministry yesterday decided to refer the deal to the CCEA, sources privy to the development said. The USD 7.2 billion deal is the single largest foreign direct investment in the country and Reliance had on February 25 made a formal application to the Oil Ministry for approval of the transfer of stake to Europe's second biggest oil company.&amp;amp;nbsp;Sources said the decision to refer the deal to CCEA, which is likely to delay approval for the deal, came more than a month after the Ministry of Home Affairs gave security clearance to the BP stake acquisition. Presently, 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) is permitted in the oil and gas exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) sector under the automatic route (without going through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board or CCEA). Sources said while security agencies' no-objection certificate for the Reliance-BP deal was unconditional, the Home Ministry's one-page note had flagged a couple of issues.  The Ministry had wanted to know if the New Exploration Licencing Policy (NELP), under which Reliance won blocks like KG-D6, provided for the sale of interest and if BP could take oil and gas produced from the area outside the country, as per the extant rules. NELP provides for the farm-out of interest and several firms have done so in the past, including Cairn India, which sold 90% stake in the KG-DWN-98/2 block adjacent to the KG-D6 fields to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in 2005, sources said, adding that export of oil is not permitted under Indian law. For natural gas, operators like Reliance don't have marketing freedom and it is the government which fixes not just the price and quantity, but also the buyers of the fuel. With such stringent laws, it is not possible for BP to take oil and gas produced from Reliance blocks outside, theysaid. The Home Ministry had also asked if Reliance could not have offered the stake to state-owned gas utility GAIL India or any other PSU. But none of the state firms, least of all gas trading firm GAIL, has the deepsea technology that Reliance is looking for to develop difficult to exploit hydrocarbon reserves. Also, the Home Ministry assertion that the Reliance-BP gas trading venture would erode GAIL's share ran against the government policy of inviting private sector competition and is contrary to the spirit of a free market economy, sources said. Reliance wants to leverage the worldwide experience of BP to resolve sub-surface technical issues at its KG-D6 gas fields, where production has fallen from 61.5 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) to about 48 mmscmd, instead of rising to the planned 69 mmscmd. The Mukesh Ambani-led firm hopes BP will be able to fix reservoir issues at the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block to rapidly raise output to the planned peak of 80 mmscmd and also to help formulate viable plans to bring other finds in the block and in other areas on to production. BP already operates oil and gas blocks in the country and has a huge lubricant business, besides a flourishing solar venture with Tata, and as such did not need security clearance, sources said. ONGC, the nation's largest state explorer, is in fact struggling to put together a viable development plan for discoveries it has made in a block adjacent to KG-D6 in the Krishna-Godavari basin.  ONGC itself has been seeking partners for that block and had shortlisted BP as a potential ally. BP will pay USD 7.2 billion for a 30% stake in 23 out of 26 exploration blocks held by Reliance and aperformance payment of up to USD 1.8 billion if the tie-up leads to the development of commercial discoveries. Reliance and BP will also form an equal joint venture for the import, marketing and transportation of natural gas. Sources said after the CCEA nod, amendments to the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) of the 23 blocks would be effected to induct BP as a partner. Reliance will retain operatorship of all 23 blocks. &amp;quot;The BP-Reliance move to form a joint venture for transporting and marketing natural gas in India is widely expected to spell trouble for public sector gas major GAIL,&amp;quot; the Home Ministry's June 1 letter said. Stating that GAIL, ONGC and Oil India had to foot Rs25,200 crore out of the Rs 75,600 crore retailers lost on selling fuel below cost, it said, &amp;quot;Oil PSUs' share in the marketing of natural gas would take a big hit if the BP-Reliance duo enters the segment in a big way, which it is expected to do so.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Thirty percent stake in Reliance's gas and oil assets could have been offered to GAIL or any other PSU which could have raised the USD 7.2 billion as a consortium,&amp;quot; it added.  Also, the ministry said it needs to be &amp;quot;ascertained whether the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) agreement/contract under which Reliance bought the oil wells had a provision for the sale of assets and whether the Reliance-BP deal would enable BP to sell/transport gas outside the country.&amp;quot; The Oil Ministry official said NELP provides for farm-outs or stake sales and Reliance's agreement with BP was in perfect conformity with that."

But we are on a very strong wicket and Rs 330-crore business (in last fiscal) was on the back of doubling of turnover every year.

This was possible because of the huge demand from consumers who look at affordability and accessibility. The company is highly technology and innovation driven and this helps us offers better value deals. Sirdeshmukh said most of the stores are located in Tier-II and Tier-III cities and the current ration of metros and smaller cities is 60:40. &amp;quot;This year we will take it to 65: 35. While we are looking at opening new stores in places like Bhimavaram (in West Godavari district), we will also penetrate in major cities to strengthen reach for the customers,&amp;quot; he said. To a question on the revenue mix between private labels and other brands, he said currently the trend is 50:50.

The CBI wants to understand the arguments offered by Mukesh Ambani's firm when it raised the cost of developing Dhirubhai 1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block from USD 2.39 billion proposed in 2004 to USD 5.196 billion in Phase-1 and another USD 3.3 billion in Phase-II. Also read: KG-D6 gas allocation case: Oil min files affidavit in HC Exploration and production of oil and gas from deep sea being complex issues, the agency wants to use the expertise of a domain expert to understand if all the expenses proposed by Reliance and approved by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) were justified. Sources in the agency said that the CBI had approached an expert for making a detailed analysis who sought a fee of over Rs 20 lakh following which it decided to write to the Petroleum Ministry. &amp;quot;We will be writing to the Petroleum Ministry for hiring the same expert for us as the agency cannot make such a huge payment,&amp;quot; a senior CBI official said. A Preliminary Enquiry into the case was registered in November 2009 on request of Petroleum Ministry following several objections raised by the anti-corruption watch dog -- CVC -- on the KG-D6 fields deal. The Central Vigilance Commission had forwarded a complaint in which it was alleged that there was a phenomenal increase in capital expenditure from USD 2.4 billion to about USD 8.8 billion in the project. Besides, the CBI may also seek help to understand why DGH allowed Reliance to retain to entire KG-D6 block in contravention of the policy that stipulates relinquishing 25% of the area every year. Reliance Industries is the operator of block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 in the Krishna Godavari (KG) Basin off the Andhra Pradesh coast. It holds 90% stake in the block while Canada's Niko Resources has the remaining 10%. In a draft audit report on KG-D6, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) allowed Reliance to hike capital expenditure for developing Dhirubhai-1 and 3, the largest of 18 gas finds in the block, by 117%. &amp;quot;The increase in cost from (USD 2.39 billion in the) Initial Development Plan to (USD 5.196 billion) in the Addendum to the Initial Development Plan is likely to have a significant impact on the government of India's financial take. &amp;quot;However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unable to comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise, of the increase in cost, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; the CAG said in a draft report sent to the Oil Ministry for comments. An operator like Reliance is allowed to recover all capital cost on developing a field from revenues earned from the sale of oil or gas before profits are split between the stakeholders, including the government. Reliance had, however, said, &amp;quot;As a responsible operator, it has fully complied with the requirements in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) at all times in conducting petroleum operations, and refutes any suggestion to the contrary. &amp;quot;The KG-D6 project... has been globally acclaimed for its cost effective, speedy, flawless execution and smooth commissioning,&amp;quot; Reliance had said in a statement."

In June, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders the company planned to invest aggressively in retail and would launch a 'cash-and-carry,' or wholesale business.

The cumulative market capitalisation of all the listed companies of Ratan Tata-led salt-to-software conglomerate today rose to Rs 4,47,351 crore, based on their share prices at the Bombay Stock Exchange. Taking into account today's RBI reference rate for one US dollar at Rs 44.5855, this translates into total market valuation of USD 100.33 billion for the Tata group.&amp;amp;nbsp;The group's total market value stood at Rs 446,420 crore(USD 99.8 billion) yesterday. The Tata group comprises of nearly 100 operating companies, but only about 30 of them are listed in the stock market. These include TCS, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power, Indian Hotels, Titan, Voltas and Tata Communications. TCS alone accounts for more than half of the group's total market value with a market capitalisation of USD 52 billion (Rs 232,194 crore). In an overall weak stock market today, when benchmark Sensex fell by 83 points, some of the Tata group companies managed to add value to their stocks. These included Rallis, Indian Hotels, Tata Communications, Tata Global Beverages, Tata Investment Corp, Trent and TCS. Tata group crossing the USD 100-billion dollar mark of market valuation today, coincided with TCS's Annual General Meeting.&amp;amp;nbsp;Incidentally, Tatas had crossed Rs 1,00,000 crore market value mark with TCS's listing on August 25, 2004, becoming the country's most valued business house at that time. Also, earlier in January this year, the Tata group's market value had briefly crossed USD 100-billion mark, but a subsequent fall in the market brought down their valuation.  Way back in September 2007, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries group had become the first business house in the country to attain a market cap of USD 100 billion.&amp;amp;nbsp;About month later, RIL alone had attained a market cap of USD 100 billion on October 18, 2007, but a high rupee valuation was also a key factor at that time. RIL's market cap at that time had risen to Rs 4,07,748 crore, which was equivalent to USD 103 billion dollars at that time's forex rates. At the end of today's market, RIL had a market value of Rs 2,82,217 crore, while its group valuation, after taking into account another listed company, RIIL (rpt) RIIL was Rs 283,014 crore (USD 63.5 billion).&amp;amp;nbsp;RIL shares today fell by about 4%, thus becoming a major drag for the benchmark Sensex. The Mukesh Ambani-led group is currently the country's second most valued business house after Tatas, which is a reversal of position from a year ago. As on June 30, 2010, Tatas were second most valued with market cap of Rs 326,827 crore, after Mukesh-led Reliance group's Rs 357,902 crore. On stand-alone basis, Reliance Industries continues to remain the country's most value company, followed by Coal India, ONGC, TCS and Infosys. Within Tata group, TCS is the most valued firm with a market cap of Rs 231,194 crore, followed by Tata Steel (Rs 57,744 crore), Tata Motors (Rs 53,528 crore), Tata Power (Rs 31,023 crore) and Titan (Rs 18,954 crore). A number of Tata group stocks, such as Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Tata Tele, Titan and Voltas lost value today, but gains in others like TCS, Tata Communications and Trent helped the group attain a market cap of over USD 100 billion.&amp;amp;nbsp;Earlier in April this year, a brokerage report had said that TCS alone was on its way to double its market cap to over USD 100 billion in another four years.

Remember these are midcap ideas not just for the day, but stocks that look attractive in the medium-term as well.  This week, Rajesh Agarwal of Eastern Financiers, Ashish Tatter from Fort Share Broking and VVLN Sastry of Firstcall India equity battle it out for top honours.  Below are their top stock picks for the day: Rajesh Agarwal of Eastern Financiers We recommed buying Hanung Toys. One can buy this stock at a stoploss of Rs 132 and target of Rs 162. The reason why we like this stock is the extremely cheap valuation. The stock has seen real battering in the last few trading sessions and has gone down to quite a reasonable valuation. Trading at the price to book value of 0.6 and and PE of 3.5, we expect the company to report the EPS of around Rs 40 for the coming year. I like Bata India. One can buy this stock with a stoploss of Rs 535 and target of Rs 630. Bata is a player in footwear industry. The full year results ended December 2010 were pretty good. The company has a large number of stores - around 1200 stores and it deals with around 30,000 dealers. The products are sold through 30,000 dealers. Bata has a strong brand positioning and they are trying to convert themselves from a brand of low value to higher value products. Third stock which we like is Talwalkars. This company is into fitness business, having around 100 healthclubs in 30 towns. The company has recently taken a strategy of eying Tier 3 &amp;amp;amp; Tier 4 cities where population is around 5 lakh and this strategy is going to do well considering the fact that the disposable income in the hands of our Indians have gone up considerably. So I think this can be a good buy even for a long term but for intraday one can buy the stock with a stoploss of Rs 240 and a target of Rs 260. We have a sell call on BPCL. This can be sold with a stoploss of Rs 655 and a target of Rs 626. The kind of run up which we have seen in the last few days due to the announcement of price hikes and all, although we are very bullish on oil marketing companies and recommend buying for a longer term but considering the fact that it has run up quite a lot we feel that some amount of correction is due. We think this will correct in the very short term. Aashish Tater, Fort Share Broking The first stock for the day is Liberty Shoes. We feel this stock has been ignored by the markets - the way Bata has been rallying I think Liberty has got quite ample scope to catch up from current levels. I have an intraday target of Rs 109 on to the stock and we have a medium term target of close to Rs 122 on the stock. The second stock for the day is Premier. I had been bullish for quite some time with a medium term target of Rs 180. I am plyaing with this stock with an intraday target of Rs 97. I feel this stock has tremendous potential and we feel the market cap and enterprise value at around Rs 440 odd mark with potential of recovering almost Rs 600 crore from its additional landbank in the Dombivali area. We feel this is a potential candidate for a long term bet and we feel that this stock can easily achieve Rs 150-160 in days to come with the announcement and the deal going through. The third stock for the day is technical call. We would like to buy Hanung Toys for an intraday target of Rs 149.50. The stock has shown good bounce back from it's lower levels. We feel that the steam can continue till Rs 162 odd mark. One should be long on to the stock with a stoploss of Rs 135 on a closing basis. The fourth stock of the day is Amar Remedies. FMCG has outperformed in yesterday"

Local oil product sales, a proxy for domestic oil demand in Asia's third-largest oil consumer, rose to 12.93 million tonne in May, the government data showed, driven by diesel sales as dealers topped up tanks expecting a price increase. In April, India's oil product demand rose an annual 4.2%. India finally raised diesel and kitchen fuel prices last week at a ministerial panel meeting which was initially expected to take place on May 11. Diesel sales, which make up over a third of refined products consumption, quickened to an annual 10.9% rise in May, the highest gain in a year, as many factories and power plants switched to the cheaper and cleaner fuel, leading to a 23.1% decline in furnace oil consumption. Gasoline sales in May rose an annual 8% versus 7.4% in April. But gasoline sales in June could ease reflecting moderating car sales, hardening interest rates and a price increase for the product.  While India should keep expanding at rates many nations would envy, Asia's third-largest economy faces a period of reduced growth and stubbornly high inflation. India's industrial output growth slowed in April, the latest sign that the rising cost of credit and inflation are acting as brakes on the economy. Indian state-run firms in mid-May raised petrol prices by about 8.6% or Rs 5 a litre.  India's crude imports rose 1.8% to 13.63 million tonne or about 3.22 million barrels per day (bpd) in May. The data for May includes estimated imports and exports for Reliance Industries's export-focused 580,000 bpd refinery at Jamnagar, in western India. Diesel exports rose 29.1% in May, while petrol exports were up 13.1% from a year ago. Oil products imports declined 38.6% while exports rose 30.5% from a year ago."

The auditor said that in the case of performance audit on hydrocarbon production sharing contracts, &amp;quot;interactive meetings were held with two operators, including RIL, prior to the finalisation of the draft performance audit report&amp;quot;. However, in a letter dated June 22, the Petroleum Ministry said the CAG&amp;amp;nbsp; did not mention its observations or seek comments of the private firms on its audit objections during the&amp;amp;nbsp; interactive meetings it had with RIL and Cairn days before finalising its draft report. Such non-disclosure was not not in line with the production sharing contract because of which government will not not be reverse any cost recovery or disallow any expenditure, the government letter said. The CAG said the performance audit follows a structured, systematic and objective architecture, which involves taking into account all relevant facts furnished by the concerned parties to ensure a balanced and objective reporting. The government auditor said that as per the audit methodology the draft report was forwarded to Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and 'Entry and Exit conferences' with the Oil Ministry as per the standard practice.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;It is for the ministry to take a view on what operator-specific points it needs to share, at this stage, with the operators,&amp;quot; the CAG said.  The CAG, in its June 8 draft report, stated that the Oil Ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), favoured Reliance and Cairn by allowing them to retain their entire exploration acreage, turning a blind eye to increases in capital expenditure and giving additional area in violation of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs).  In the draft report, the CAG said rules were bent, enabling Reliance to retain the entire 7,645 square kilometre KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6 block, in the Krishna Godavari Basin off the East Coast.&amp;amp;nbsp;Also, the development plan Reliance submitted for Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, was not in compliance with the PSC and the ministry and the DGH turned blind eye to the company raising capital expenditure without having begun work on the previous one."

While the CAG all through the audit of Reliance's KG-D6 gas field and Cairn's Rajasthan oilfields last year avoided meeting the companies, the auditor did not mention its observations or seek comments in interactive meetings it had days before finalising its draft report. &amp;quot;In the interactive meeting... one of the operators gave a presentation on how the project was executed and no audit observations were discussed. In the other meeting, only one observation was discussed with the operator,&amp;quot; the Oil Ministry wrote to the CAG on June 22. &amp;quot;The operators were not given any draft report before this meeting so that they could have come prepared with some reply,&amp;quot; it added. The CAG, in its June 8 draft report, said that the ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, favoured Reliance and Cairn by allowing them to retain their entire exploration acreage, turning a blind eye to increases in capital expenditure and giving additional area in violation of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs). The Oil Ministry asked the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to now give the private operators a chance to present their views, but the nation's top auditor turned down the request. &amp;quot;The contractors have seen and replied to the audit requisitions and memos only. They have not been given the draft report which has the response to audit queries and observation of CAG,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote on June 22. &amp;quot;Relevant extracts of the draft report have to be given to the concerned operators for a proper reply; Ministry of Petroleum and Natural gas has initiated this process.&amp;quot; The CAG on the same day replied back saying its &amp;quot;audit mandate, scope and coverage&amp;quot; did not provide for seeking a response on its draft observations and the government can raise audit objections after it has finalised its report. Within days of the early June meetings with Reliance and Cairn, the only formal interaction the CAG had with them, the auditor sent its draft report to the ministry for comments. The ministry cited provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) signed with Reliance and Cairn to state that seeking comments on audit observations was a must. &amp;quot;Any audit exception shall (have to) be made available by the government in writing to the contractor within 120 days following completion of the audit in question and thereafter, the contractor shall answer within 120 days of receipt of such notice,&amp;quot; it wrote. &amp;quot;Thus, if the audit exceptions are not notified, any reversal of cost recovery/disallowance of any expenditure (based on audit exception) will not be feasible from the operator. This could also lead to disputes and the operator may choose to initiate an arbitration also,&amp;quot; the Oil Ministry said. The CAG took almost a year since completion of the audit in June last year to prepare the draft report. But now it is not giving the operators a few weeks to respond as per the principle of natural justice, sources said. The CAG wants an exit conference with the ministry to be held in the first week of July to conclude its final report. In the draft report, the CAG said rules were bent, enabling Reliance to&amp;amp;nbsp;retain the entire 7,645-square kilometre KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6 block, in the Krishna-Godavari Basin off the East Coast. Also, the development plan Reliance submitted for Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, was not in compliance with the PSC and the ministry and the DGH turned blind eye to the company raising capital expenditure without having begun work on the previous one. Reliance had in May, 2004, proposed an investment of USD 2.4 billion for producing 40 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the D1 and D3 fields and later, in October, 2006, moved an addendum to this saying USD 5.2 billion would be required in Phase-1 to produce 80 mmscmd of gas and another USD 3.3 billion to sustain the peak output for a longerduration. The CAG, however, did not say Reliance overbilled the government or caused a loss to the exchequer with the increase in development cost. &amp;quot;The increase in cost from Initial Development Plan (IDP) to Addendum to IDP is likely to have significant adverse impact on government of India's financial take. However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unable to comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise, of theincrease in cost from IDP to AIDP, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; it said. The CAG stated that the Oil Ministry and DGH &amp;quot;irregularly allowed the operator (Reliance) to enter successive exploration phases without the stipulate relinquishment of area and then allowed the operator to declare the entire contract area as a 'discovery area', thus avoiding any relinquishment whatsoever.&amp;quot; On the Cairn India-operated Rajasthan oil fields, it said the grant of an additional area of 1,708.20 square kilometres beyond the contract area by the government was not in line with the provisions of the PSC, adversely affecting the sacrosanct nature of the contract area and its phased relinquishment."

Cairn India, which had made four discoveries in the KG-DWN-98/2 block before selling 90% out of its 100% stake in the block to ONGC in 2005, has written to the oil regulator DGH saying the state-owned firm is grossly overstating the reserves in block, sources said. CCEA may mull giving nod to Cairn-Vedanta deal this week It believes that &amp;quot;the hither-to discovered oil and gas resources in the block are only marginal to non-commercial, because of their small size and the potential high development costs due to water depth versus the prevailing gas prices.&amp;quot; ONGC estimates that the blocks holds an in-place volume of 25.61 million tonnes of oil and 197 billion cubic metres of natural gas. It is proposing an investment of over USD 7.3 billion to produce up to 30 million standard cubic metres per day of gas. The warning by Cairn, which holds a 10% interest in the acreage and is credited with finding oil in an area in Rajasthan where global giant Royal Dutch/Shell exited saying there was no hydrocarbons, is significant in view of the fall in gas output from Reliance's neighbouring KG-D6 block. Reliance had in 2007 estimated that the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields in the KG-D6 block would hit 69 mmscmd of output, but production has fallen to 40 mmscmd due to what the Mukesh Ambani-led firm says are reservoir complexities. Cairn, which is recognised the world-over for its expertise in assessment of hydrocarbon resources, wants &amp;quot;a correct reserve estimation of the block through an independent agency.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The work undertaken (to assess reserves in the block) by Schlumberger Data and Consulting Services in 2007 (at the behest of ONGC) is flawed and they substantially over-estimated the resources in the block,&amp;quot; it wrote to DGH. Stating that it had on various occasions pointed out to the flaws, Cairn said, &amp;quot;It is imperative that a new study is undertaken by a third party of repute which enjoys the confidence of both ONGC and Cairn, such as DeGolyer &amp;amp;amp; MacNaughton, in order to establish a correct assessment of the resources, based on which the stakeholders would be able to take appropriate decisions.&amp;quot; Cairn said ONGC had submitted a proposal to declare some of the discoveries in the block as commercial, a step toward developing the finds, without keeping it informed. ONGC, it said, was submitting various proposals without prior approval of the Operating Committee -- an oversight body comprising representatives of both partners. Submission of proposals without OC approval is a violation of the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement. Cairn claims that an innovative production method has to be worked out for the block in discussion with the DGH and the Oil Ministry. It also questioned the basis on which ONGC is seeking an extension of the appraisal period, which was completed as per the provisions of the PSC. It has asked for re-submission of the Declarations of Commerciality for the discoveries made in the block as well. ONGC bought 90% interest in Block KG-DWN-98/2 from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn still holds 10% in the block. Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area -- Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna). Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries -- E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1/KT-1 and the first ultra-deepwater discovery UD-1 at a record depth of 2,841 metres. The block is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U, A, while the ultra deepsea UD find lies in SDA. Even ONGC has acknowledged that the NDA discoveries are small to marginal and can not be developed on a standalone basis due to high deepwater development costs. Accordingly, it is proposing to develop the discoveries in an integrated cluster. Sources said the ONGC Declaration of Commerciality (DOC) of NDA on July 15, 2010, was submitted without OC approval and so was the DOC of SDA on December 21, 2009. The DGH, they said, wants a fresh proposal for DOC to be submitted by the operator after completion of the proposed appraisal drilling programme by July 16, 2013, in case of NDA and by December 22, 2012, in case of SDA, or by July 16, 2013, for both the NDA and SDA."

However, the Oil Ministry rejected the criticism saying&amp;amp;nbsp;the New Exploration Licencing Policy under which Reliance bagged the KG-D6 block was designed by the BJP-led NDA government in 1999 and the terms being deplored now are ones vetted and signed by the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. Reliance bagged the KG-DWN-98/3 block in the first round of NELP, which was pioneered by the NDA government, and signed the PSC for the block in 2000. &amp;quot;The Congress-led UPA government first came into power in May, 2004. You don't expect contracts signed by sovereign governments to be reneged just because a different party has come into power,&amp;quot; an official said. The PSCs provides for the operator to recover all capital and operating expenditure become the government's share of profit from a field rises to as high as 85%.&amp;amp;nbsp;This system gives &amp;quot;incentive to (an operator to) increase his investment, or front-end his work plan&amp;quot; in order to see that the threshold where government's profit take rises rapidly is not reached, the Chawla panel said in its report.&amp;amp;nbsp; Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy had yesterday indicated that the government will be open to accepting suggestions that can improve PSCs, but there are doubts if any chances in policy can be implemented with retrospective effect. At the heart of the PSC lies the 'investment multiple', the ratio of net cash income to exploration and development costs. The investment multiple defines the share of profits that go to the government. The higher the expenditure, thelower the IM and hence, the government's share of profit. Citing the example of KG-D6, the Chawla panel said, &amp;quot;The relationship between the pre-tax investment multiple (PTIM) and the share of contractor profit petroleum changes dramatically once the PTIM crosses 2.5, with the government's share increasing from 28% to 85%.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is useful to remember that this schedule is bid by the operator and not determined by the government,&amp;quot; it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;A high share of some PTIM will help to win the bid, depending on the financial model of evaluation used, but it does raise concerns that such a radical change would provide very strong incentives for any operator to adopt all investment and strategies possible to ensure that the PTIM stays within the 2.5 limit,&amp;quot; the panel report said. The CAG, in a draft report on its audit of the KG-D6 accounts, had also criticised the current PSC structure saying it was &amp;quot;unsuitable for protecting the government of India's financial interests.&amp;quot; The Chawla panel said the NELP model is not an outright upfront bid model (often called a bonus model). &amp;quot;Neither is it a standard royalty model as seen in mining systems, where revenue is shared regardless of profitability. Rather, it is a model that allows the operator to substantially recover his costs before the sharing of revenue,&amp;quot; it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;However, once these costs are recovered, the sharing with the government is often large.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Private contractors have virtually no incentive to minimise capital expenditure and a substantial incentive to increase capital expenditure so as to retain the PTIM in the lower slabs, which would result in low/lowest share of profit petroleum for the government of India,&amp;quot; the draft CAG report said. The auditor said the Oil Ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, &amp;quot;did not pay adequate attention to protecting the government's financial interest.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;The report has been sent to the ministry for its comments. The CAG was asked to audit KG-D6 after allegations of &amp;quot;gold-plating&amp;quot;, or artificially inflating costs, were levelled against Reliance, which increased the development cost of the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block from USD 2.39 billion proposed in May, 2004, to USD 8.8 billion in 2006. The Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended a sliding scale of royalty payment linked to different oil and gas production quantities or values. &amp;quot;In our opinion, this is the best formula, given the current context, for harmonising the financial interests of both the government and private contractors.&amp;quot; However, it said if the Oil Ministry wished to retain the current PTIM model, it should allow prospectors to bid as per a fixed profit-sharing formula with a specified band.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;This will at least minimise the incentive for skewed capital expenditure resulting in very low government share of profit petroleum, although it will still require enormous efforts by the government to control cost recovery,&amp;quot; the CAG said."

The Prime Minister and the Union Cabinet must take full responsibility and order an inquiry into the matter,&amp;quot; CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury told reporters. Maintaining that they would raise the issue in Parliament, he said, &amp;quot;The Prime Minister is on record to say that India can ill-afford crony capitalism. But the worst form of crony capitalism is happening under his leadership.&amp;quot; There has been a raging controversy over the Comptroller and Auditor General''s draft report severely criticising Oil Ministry''s role in approving Reliance Industries'' KG-D6 &amp;quot;inflated&amp;quot; field costs. The Ministry has said no one should jump to conclusions as the report is yet to be finalised. &amp;quot;This is yet another example of crony capitalism, as we saw in the scams relating to 2G spectrum, Commonwealth Games and Adarsh society, where sweetheart deals are given to private companies, allowing them to make windfall profits&amp;quot;, he said. Yechury and another CPI(M) Rajya Sabha member Tapan Sen spoke of &amp;quot;another scam that is unfolding&amp;quot; from the report of CAG which audited the production sharing contracts and &amp;quot;exposed the nexus between the UPA government and the Reliance Industries&amp;quot;. They demanded immediate action against then Director General (Hydrocarbons) and other officials and sought delinking of gas prices from the international crude prices immediately. Sen said he had written seven letters since 2006 to then Petroleum Minister Murli Deora and thrice to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the contracts on KG basin gas with RIL. &amp;quot;There has been no concrete response as yet. But our stand has been vindicated by this draft CAG report,&amp;quot; he said. The CPI(M) leaders charged the then Director General and other officials with &amp;quot;colluding in this sordid affair&amp;quot;, causing loss to public exchequer and &amp;quot;unduly benefiting&amp;quot; RIL. &amp;quot;The price of KG basin gas should be revised on the basis of actual cost of production and a cost-plus formula,&amp;quot; they said. Yechury and Sen also sought immediate amendment in the present pricing formula in Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in consultation with the CAG. The two leaders released all the letters written to the Prime Minister and the Petroleum Minister since 2006 and now, as also copies of replies to questions raised in this regard in Parliament. Sen said the pricing exercise, approved by an Empowered Group of Ministers, only considered the price of 4.2 dollar per unit offered by RIL and &amp;quot;ignored the price offered by the same RIL to NTPC which was much lower at 2.4 dollars.&amp;quot; He also released a letter written by NTPC CMD to Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in 2007, saying the state-run power firm would suffer a whopping loss of Rs 24,000 crore in the contract period of 17 years due to the price differential between the gas price already being delivered at Kawas/Gandhar and RIL's proposed price."

The energy-to-retail conglomerate plans to utilise the fresh five-year term loan to refinance its existing higher interest rate debts, sources said. When contacted, a company spokesperson did not comment on the debt raising plans.  The banks hired for raising USD 1.1 billion of loans include SBI, Stanchart, Bank of America, RBS, HSBC, ANZ Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, DBS and Sumitomo Mitsui. Earlier this month, Chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani said at the company's AGM that RIL would become debt-free on net basis in the current financial year ending March 2012. RIL had an outstanding debt of Rs 67,397 crore (USD 15.1 billion) as of March 31, 2011, as against Rs 62,495 crore (USD 13.9 billion) a year ago. At the same time, RIL had cash and cash-equivalents of Rs 42,393 crore (USD 9.5 billion) as on March 31 this year, which was nearly double the level seen a year ago.  The company began a process last month to raise fresh loans worth about USD 1.5 billion. Out of this, loans worth about USD 1.1 billion are for repaying its existing loans maturing in next two years, while the company would also look at further USD 400-500 million of fresh borrowings from abroad.  Last year in October, RIL had raised USD 1.5 billion for the first time through bonds denominated in US dollars. While it raised USD one billion through 10-year bonds, another USD 500 million were arranged through sale of 30-year bonds. These funds were raised through RIL's wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance Holding USA Inc. This USD 1.5 billion bond sale was the company's first such bond issue after 13 years.  Besides, it was the largest ever public market offshore bond offering by RIL and largest ever corporate bond from India. This debt raising exercise was followed by plans to raise funds through sale of bonds in global markets by other Indian companies. These companies included the likes of Anil Ambani group firm Reliance Communications, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Essar Energy, JSW Steel and IDBI Bank."

The preparation of a detailed reply will take some time.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is only after taking into account the reply of Government that the Office of CAG will suitably amend the draft report and send the final report for placing it on the table of Parliament,&amp;quot; it added. The&amp;amp;nbsp;CAG in its draft report had alleged that the oil ministry and its technical arm DGH favoured Reliance but did not say if by doubling of cost of developing eastern offshore KG-D6 field the Mukesh Ambani firm had overbilled the government and thereby caused loss to the state exchequer. It also pulled up the ministry for going out of its way to grant nearly 1,700 sq km of additional area to Cairn India adjacent to its oil discovery in Rajasthan block. &amp;quot;As the process of preparation of reply and its vetting by the Office of CAG is yet to be completed, it would be premature for the Ministry to give any response on the observations made in the draft report at this stage,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;It would be equally incorrect for the media commentators, political leaders and civil rights activists to jump to conclusions and thus short-circuit the process,&amp;quot; the statement added. On receipt of ministry's reply, the Office of CAG will examine the reply on merits and will hold an exit conference with it before making its final observations. &amp;quot;The Ministry, therefore, appeals to all concerned to exercise restraint and allow the process to be completed,&amp;quot; the statement said. The Ministry said it was at its request in November 2007 that the Comptroller &amp;amp;amp; Auditor General of India agreed to carry out special audit in respect of certain blocks/fields operated under pre-New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and NELP regimes. &amp;quot;The draft Performance Audit Report has been received in this Ministry on June 8, 2011,&amp;quot; it added. &amp;quot;While the above process is underway, the leaked draft report is being reported and commented upon in sections of the media.&amp;quot; The CAG in its draft audit report on KG-D6 block said the ministry and DGH also bent the rules to grant &amp;quot;huge benefits&amp;quot; to Reliance when it was allowed to retain the entire block, but said gains cannot be quantified. &amp;quot;The increase in (Phase-1) cost from (USD 2.39 billion proposed in the) Initial Development Plan (of May 2004) to (USD 5.196 billion) in the addendum to the Initial Development Plan is likely to have a significant impact on the&amp;amp;nbsp; government of India's financial take. &amp;quot;However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unable to comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise of the increase in cost, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; CAG said in the draft report. Responding to the reports in media, Reliance earlier this week said that &amp;quot;as a responsible operator, it has fully complied with the requirements in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) at all times in conducting petroleum operations, and refutes any suggestion to the contrary&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The KG-D6 project.. has been globally acclaimed for its cost effective, speedy, flawless execution and smooth commissioning,&amp;quot; Reliance had said in a statement. Reliance had raised the cost of bringing to production India's first deep-sea and the largest gas field after reserves almost doubled to 11.3 trillion cubic feet, raising the peak output two times to 80 million cubic meters per day. An operator like Reliance is allowed to recover all the capital cost incurred on developing a field from revenues earned from the sale of oil or gas before profits are split between the stakeholders, including the government. The CAG conducted the audit of the Reliance accounts after allegations of 'gold-plating', or artificially inflating the development costs of Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields, two of the 18 discoveries in KG-D6 block, were levied by the AnilAmbani Group. The premier auditor, whose report will be tabled in Parliament after incorporating comments from the Oil Ministry, said Reliance never had the intention of developing KG-D6 gas fields as per the initial cost estimates and said it did not initiate tendering for equipment as per the original plan. CAG recommended that the &amp;quot;role of DGH and government of India representative on the Management Committee may be closely scrutinised to see why the operator was allowed to violate the provisions of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and not adhere strictly to the terms of the approved initial development plan&amp;quot;. On Cairns India, the CAG said as per the PSC, the total contract area of the company's operated RJ-ON-90/1 block' in Rajasthan was 11,108 sq km. The Oil Ministry agreed to Cairn's request for grant of additional 852.2 sq km in August 2004 and 856 sq km in March 2005. &amp;quot;In our view, the contract area under the PSC is sacrosanct... It can by no means be argued that already discovered reservoirs extend over the entire extended area of 852.20 sq km (and) 856 sq km,&amp;quot; it said."

The Ministry of Home Affairs wrote a one-page letter to the Petroleum Ministry on June 1 giving security clearance and a no-objection certificate for BP buying a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks of Reliance in India's largest foreign direct investment, a top Oil Ministry official said. While the NOC to the Reliance-BP deal is unconditional, the Home Ministry asked if Reliance could not have offered the stake to state-owned gas utility GAIL India or any other PSU. &amp;quot;Our PSUs do not have the expertise Reliance has been looking for. It wanted an expert in deepsea technology and GAIL, which is a gas marketing and transportation company, hardly fits the description,&amp;quot; he said. Reliance wants to leverage the worldwide experience of Europe's second biggest energy company to resolve sub-surface technical issues at its KG-D6 gas fields, where production has fallen from 61.5 million standard cubic metres per day to about 48 mmscmd, instead of rising to the planned 69 mmscmd. The Mukesh Ambani-led firm hopes BP would be able to fix reservoir issues at the Dhirubhai-1 and&amp;amp;nbsp;three gas fields in the KG-D6 block to rapidly raise output to the planned peak of 80 mmscmd and also help in formulating viable plans to bring to production other finds in the block and in other areas. Industry observers scoffed at the idea of Reliance first offering the stake to firms like GAIL and asked whether the Home Ministry would suggest the same to Cairn Energy, which is selling its Indian unit to London-listed mining group Vedanta Resources. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is already a 30% partner in Cairn India's mainstay Rajasthan block and could easily takeover Cairn Energy shares. They questioned the Oil Ministry's rationale of seeking security clearance for BP when the company is already operating oil and gas blocks in the country, has a huge lubricant business and a flourishing solar venture with Tata. ONGC, the nation's largest state explorer, is in fact struggling to put together a viable development plan for discoveries it has made in a block adjacent to KG-D6 in the Krishna-Godavari basin. ONGC itself has been seeking partnersfor that block and had shortlisted BP as a potential ally. The official said the Home Ministry has also asked if oil and gas can be exported. &amp;quot;That is ridiculous to even think. Production Sharing Contract (PSC) bars export of oil and the Supreme Court has upheld the government's absolute powers to decide users of natural gas. So while India is energy deficit, no government can even think of exporting gas.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;There is no way that BP can take oil and gas produced from Reliance blocks to the UK,&amp;quot; he added. Europe's second biggest oil company, BP will pay USD 7.2 billion for a 30% stake in 23 out of 26 exploration blocks held by Reliance and a performance payment of up to USD 1.8 billion if the tie-up leads to the development of commercial discoveries. Reliance and BP will also form an equal joint venture for the import, marketing and transportation of natural gas. After the NOC from the Home Ministry, the Petroleum Ministry will accord in-principle approval to the transaction, after which amendments to the production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) of the 23 blocks would be effected to induct BP as a partner. Reliance will retain operatorship of all 23 blocks. &amp;quot;The BP-Reliance move to form a joint venture for transporting and marketing natural gas in India is widely expected to spell trouble for public sector gas major GAIL,&amp;quot; the Home Ministry's June 1 letter said. Stating that GAIL, ONGC and Oil India had to foot Rs 25,200 crore out of the Rs 75,600 crore retailers lost on selling fuel below cost, it said, &amp;quot;Oil PSUs' share in the marketing of natural gas would take a big hit if the BP-Reliance duo enters the segment in a big way, which it is expected to do so.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;30% stake in Reliance's gas and oil assets could have been offered to GAIL or any other PSU which could have raised the USD 7.2 billion as a consortium,&amp;quot; it added. Also, the ministry said it needs to be &amp;quot;ascertained whether the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) agreement/contract under which Reliance bought the oil wells had a provision for the sale of assets and whether the Reliance-BP deal would enable BP to sell/transport gas outside the country.&amp;quot; The Oil Ministry official said NELP provides for farm-outs or stake sales and Reliance's agreement with BP was in perfect conformity with that. The USD 7.2 billion Reliance-BP deal is seen as the biggest FDI into India. A much larger proposed transaction -- Posco's USD 12 billion investment announced years ago for a steel plant in Orissa -- is yet to take off.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Reliance is the operator in all the 23 blocks, while Canadian Niko Resources and UK's Hardy Oil have minority 10% interest in a few. After the deal, Reliance' holding in the blocks will come down to 60-70%. Nineteen out of 23 blocks lie off the East Coast, while two blocks are onland, in Assam and Gujarat."

While Reddy refused to comment on his 15 minute meeting with the Prime Minister this morning, sources in his ministry said the meeting was fixed a long time back, much before the CAG submitted in draft audit report on June 8. The ministry, they said, will take at least five-six weeks to reply to points raised by CAG which Reddy may have told the Prime Minister. CAG had asked for comments in two weeks time. The delay in ministry's reply may mean that the CAG final report would not be tabled in Parliament in the monsoon session of Parliament next month. Sources said the ministry is taking longer time as it has an entirely new set of officials. The decision on KG-D6 field were taken when Murli Deora was the minister and VK Sibal was the head of ministry's technical arm, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. Incidentally, Sibal too was in the ministry on Tuesday probably to explain to the new Oil Secretary GC Chaturvedi and his team about his role in KG-D6 approvals. CAG in its draft report had rapped oil ministry and its technical arm DGH for allegedly favouring Reliance by allowing it to double KG-D6 gas field's cost but it stopped short of saying if the Mukesh Ambani firm had overbilled the government nd thereby caused loss to the state exchequer. It also pulled up the ministry for going out of its way to grant over 856 sq km of additional area to Cairn India adjacent to its oil discovery in Rajasthan block.

Reliance, however, said that &amp;quot;as a responsible operator, it has fully complied with the requirements in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) at all times in conducting petroleum operations, and refutes any suggestion to the contrary&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The KG-D6 project.. has been globally acclaimed for its cost effective, speedy, flawless execution and smooth commissioning,&amp;quot; Reliance said in a statement yesterday."

The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) rejected D-30, D-31 and D-34 finds in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block as commercially exploitable discoveries on account of low reserves they may hold, sources privy to the development said.  Reliance, which has seen output from its main fields in the eastern offshore block fall by over 20% since March last year, wanted to tie-up the smaller discoveries together to a common facility to produce 5.7 million cubic meters of gas per day -- double of what state-owned ONGC's newest gas field, C-Series , produces.  But DGH rejected the proposal to declare the discoveries as commercial, saying that Reliance and its Canadian partner Niko Resources had not provided results of tests done on individual wells to confirm the finds.  Sources said it also turned down the indicative production profile made by Reliance saying, &amp;quot;MDT tests used do not provide sustainable production levels, which is a requirement for evaluation of commerciality of discoveries.&amp;quot;  Reliance, in its proposal, had estimated in-place reserves of 749 billion cubic feet in the three finds, which would have needed&amp;amp;nbsp;USD&amp;amp;nbsp;877.2 million in capital expenditure to produce peak rate of 5.7 mmcmd.  The Mukesh Ambani-run firm had in 2008-09 made four gas discoveries, D-29, D-30, D-31 and D-34 in the KG-D6 block. In July 2009, it submitted a proposal for declaring them as commercial, a step after which the company could have firmed up investment proposal for bringing the finds into production.  Sources said DGH, in the first instance, rejected Declaration of Commerciality of all the four finds saying the gas volumes were too low to justify production.  However, Reliance persisted with its claims and DGH declared D-34 as commercial with an estimated peak production level of 14.68 mmcmd over 8 year life of the field with&amp;amp;nbsp;USD 2.338 billion investment in development, they said.  Reliance has seen output from D-1 and D-3, the biggest find among one-and-half-dozen discoveries in KG-D6 block, drop from 61.5 million standard cubic meters per day to about 48 mmscmd, instead of rising to planned 69 mmscmd because of high volumes of water being produced with natural gas.  It now plans to produce from smaller finds in the block. A Field Development Plan (FDP) for four satellite gas discoveries (D-2, 6, 19 and 22) is under evaluation at DGH. "

The public sector lender, which also has significant exposures to troubled Air India besides certain telecom firms being probed in relation to the 2G scam, has now disclosed that its credit to RIL was in excess of the limits prescribed under the RBI's prudential credit norms. Detailing the cases where it breached prudential limits for single-borrower exposure during the fiscal ended March 31, 2011, SBI has named RIL as also public sector majors Indian Oil and BHEL as three such borrowers in its annual report. This is the third straight year when SBI has exceeded the single-borrower ceiling with regard to RIL, as per the bank's annual reports for the past three financial years. However, the bank brought down its exposure to RIL within the limit on the last date of the previous fiscal, ie March 31, 2011, according to the SBI annual report. The public sector lender had provided credit in excess of prudential norms to RIL during 2009-10 and 2008-09 also. During the year 2009-10, the bank's credit exposure was in excess of prudential limits for Reliance Industries, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), BHEL and Tata Group. Prior to that, SBI exceeded prudential credit limits during 2008-09 with regard&amp;amp;nbsp; to its exposure to RIL and IOC. As per RBI guidelines, the exposure ceiling limits are 15% of capital funds in case of a single borrower and 40% of capital funds in the case of a borrower group. However, the credit exposure to a single borrower can go up to 20%, if the additional 5% exposure is on account of extension of credit to infrastructure projects. Similarly, the credit exposure to borrowers belonging to a group may go up to 50%, if the additional 10% exposure is for credit to infrastructure projects. The bank's exposure to telecom companies recently came under criticism as some of these companies are facing probes in connection with the 2G scam involving alleged breach of regulations in allotment of licenses. In an analyst conference after the bank's full-year results for 2010-11, SBI disclosed that its exposure to telecom companies was Rs 22,600 crore (3% of its loan book), while exposure to telecom companies under investigation was Rs 1500 crore. Besides, its exposure to airline companies, including troubled Air India was Rs 4,500 crore. The bank also disclosed a total exposure of Rs 1,00,000crore in the infrastructure sector, including Rs 30,000 croreto the power sector. With regard to single-borrower exposure limit exceeded in 2010-11, SBI said in its annual report, that its credit to RIL breached the prudential ceiling on three occasions during the year -- between April and July 2010, from August to October 2010 and from November 2010 to February 2011. Between April and July 2010, SBI's exposure to RIL was Rs 15,815.48 crore, as against a ceiling of Rs 13,646.26 crore, while the exposures exceeded the respective limits by well over Rs 1,000 crore on two other occasions also. The outstanding exposure to RIL as on March 31, 2011stood at Rs 5,645.44 crore, which was within the limits. For IOC and BHEL also, the credit exposure exceeded the ceiling on three occasions during 2010-11. During the year 2009-10, the credit exposure exceeded the prudential ceilings on three occasions each for IOC, RIL and BHEL, while the exposure was in excess of the limit for Tata Group on two occasions. For 2008-09 also, the credit exposure was in excess of the permitted level on three occasions for both RIL and IOC."

RIL, which has 26 oil and gas blocks, including the giant KG-D6 fields, has been applying to the Home Ministry for security clearance of the specialised expatriate technical personnel deployed on its offshore vessels, including seismic survey ships, drill ships, tug boats and supply vessels. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) clearance is accorded to expat staff for a period of one year or the duration of the visit of these personnel, whichever is earlier. RIL in a letter to the Oil Ministry said MHA had vide a letter dated April 8, 2008 permitted it to move expatriates, within the validity of their security clearance, from one block to another block that are allotted by the Government to it. &amp;quot;However, lately the MHA clearance is being accorded to the personnel with a specific restriction that if the expatriate changes the block of stay within the validity period of security clearance accorded to him, then the operator (RIL) needs to seek a fresh security clearance for the same. This is causing not only difficulty but almost choking our operations,&amp;quot; it said. RIL said the high operation/rental costs of the mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) which comprise of drill ships, semi-submersibles and jackup rigs, demand prudent and optimal deployment between various blocks to fulfill its drilling and other work commitments. &amp;quot;Hence, these MODUs move between drilling locations at various blocks... Seeking fresh security clearance every time for (their) movement may not be practical,&amp;quot; the company said. Stating that the availability of specialised, trained expatriates to man these MODUs was very specific and limited, RIL said the MHA clearance once applied afresh takes a period of three-four weeks and idling of assets for want of specialized personnel imposes a lot of financial losses. &amp;quot;Hence we need flexibility in mobilizing these expatriates between blocks allotted to us. Otherwise it would cause huge financial losses in terms of idle assets / services and personnel,&amp;quot; it added. RIL has requested withdrawal of the requirement of fresh clearance while changing the block of stay and reverting back to MHA's April 2008 policy."

CNG price were last hiked on April 3 when IGL raised rates by Rs 0.30 per kg. Explaining the reason leading to the revision in the price of CNG and liquefied natural gas, IGL Managing Director Rajesh Vedvyas said the rates have been hiked because of increase in cost of input (natural gas). Besides government controlled gas and fuel from Reliance Industries' KG-D6 fields, both of which are priced at USD 4.20 per million British thermal unit, IGL also buys higher priced imported LNG to meet the demand in Delhi and its adjoining cities. The increase in price of LNG has led to the hike in CNG rates. Vedvyas said today's increase would have marginal impact on the running cost of CNG vehicles. &amp;quot;Despite the aforesaid prices increase, CNG would still offer 66% savings towards the running cost when compared to petrol driven vehicles at the current level of prices. When compared to diesel driven vehicles the economics in favour of CNG at revised price would be 21%,&amp;quot; he said. "

The conglomerate also plans to invest aggressively in its retail business and will launch cash-and-carry, or wholesale outlets, Mukesh Ambani said at the company's annual shareholder meeting. Reliance, the largest listed firm in India , is controlled by Mukesh Ambani, the world's ninth richest man with a net worth estimated at USD 27 billion, according to Forbes. The company is looking to expand in sectors such as telecom, retail, power, financial services and hospitality. &amp;quot;Reliance is endowed with a strong balance sheet and depth of talent,&amp;quot; Ambani said, adding that the company was &amp;quot;uniquely placed to pursue multiple growth opportunities.&amp;quot; Last year, Reliance made a dramatic return to the telecom business with the USD 1 billion acquisition of Infotel Broadband, the only company to win a nationwide licence for broadband wireless spectrum in a government auction. &amp;quot;Broadband - and broadband enabled digital services - is the next big leap forward in the digital transformation of our knowledge economy,&amp;quot; Ambani said to shareholders. He said the company plans to build broadband infrastructure spanning industries such as education, healthcare and financial services. But energy is still the company's mainstay. Its D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin off India's east coast is its biggest gas producer, but output has slipped due to technical problems to about 52 million cubic metres a day (mcmd) from 60 mcmd in 2010 and short of a target of 80 mcmd. In February, Reliance agreed to sell a stake in 23 of its oil and gas blocks, including some in the KG basin, to BP in a USD 7.2 billion deal, and is expected to benefit from BP's deepwater exploration expertise.  &amp;quot;After the government approvals for BP-Reliance partnership, KG-D6 reservoir will be jointly assessed to address technical issues in ramping up production,&amp;quot; Ambani said. &amp;quot;Meanwhile, vigorous efforts are underway to accelerate development process of other discoveries,&amp;quot; he said, referring to the company's Mahanadi block off the country's east coast and the Cambay block in the western Indian state of Gujarat.  Ambani also said the company would be free of net debt by the end of fiscal year 2012. As of March 31, its long-term debt stood at USD 12.4 billion, and its cash and cash equivalents were USD 9.5 billion. Shares in Reliance, valued at USD 68.8 billion, turned negative after rising as much as 1.7% before the meeting, as the lack of any major announcement by Ambani disappointed investors. &amp;quot;People were expecting him (Mukesh Ambani) to make major comments on future plans,&amp;quot; said Arun Kejriwal, director at research firm KRIS. &amp;quot;Nothing significant has been spoken.&amp;quot; Shares were down 0.5% at Rs.946.70 by 12:29 p.m. (0659 GMT) in a Mumbai market that was little changed. They have fallen more than 10% so far in 2011, contributing significantly to the comparative 9.8% fall in the main index, in which the stock has the heaviest weight.  (USD 1 = INR 44.825)"

With output from the KG-D6 fields falling from 61.5 million standard cubic metres per day to less than 48 mmscmd, the Oil Ministry has ordered Reliance to first meet the full demand of priority users -- power, fertiliser, city gas and LPG plants -- before supplying to non-core industries. With output just a shade above core sector demand, supplies to steel plants, refineries and petrochemical units have been cut. Reliance is the biggest loser, as it faced cuts at both its refineries and petrochemical units. Sources said Reliance last month wrote to the Oil Ministry saying petrochemical plants like LPG extraction units also strip natural gas of its higher fraction before it is burnt as fuel in industries and so, should be given equal priority in allocation of gas. Natural gas predominantly consists of methane and small percentages of higher fractions of ethane, propane and butane. Whereas ethane is the feedstock for petrochemicals, propane and butane are mainly used for production of LPG. Since these are value-added fractions, the government has always mandated that gas must be stripped of higher fractions before supply to various consumers. Various petrochemical and LPG plants were set up in India as a result of this policy. Reliance said this policy was reiterated by an Empowered Group of Ministers, which allocated KG-D6 gas among various users in May, 2008. &amp;quot;The government had allocated 2.59 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas to (state-run) GAIL for LPG and 1.92 mmscmd to Dahej/Nagothane petrochemical plants of Reliance,&amp;quot; the letter said. &amp;quot;While making the allocations in line with policy decided by the EGoM, it was directed that all locations where higher fractions are being used as fuel should be identified and steps should be taken to stop such usage of higher fractions as fuel by supplying lean gas at such locations,&amp;quot; it said. Reliance said while other sectors like steel have an option to use imported LNG, gas-based petrochemical units as well as LPG plants have to mainly rely on domestic sources of rich gas. &amp;quot;However, we find that there is some mismatch between the declared policy of the government/EGoM regarding usage of higher fractions of natural gas and the lower priority accorded to them by Petroleum Ministry while directing sectoral cuts on KG-D6 supply,&amp;quot; Reliance wrote. &amp;quot;Again, there is a dichotomy that whereas the LPG sector has been kept as second priority after fertilisers, petrochemicals are considered non-core sector, though the usage of higher fractions of gas in petrochemicals and the LPG sectors is similar,&amp;quot; it said.

There are expectations of a number of major announcements from RIL chief when he addresses the company's shareholders at its Annual General Meeting on June 3.&amp;amp;nbsp;Speculations are rife that Ambani would announce major business initiatives and investment plans for RILs various existing businesses as also new ventures in telecom, power and financial services. Earlier in April, the company said in an investor presentation that it would pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities to meet its growth aspirations.&amp;amp;nbsp;Besides, it also disclosed an &amp;quot;investment programme of over USD 10 billion to cater to domestic market&amp;quot; in petrochemicals business. Earlier at an investor conference in February, RIL had projected investment totalling USD 25-30 billion (Rs 1,10,000-1,35,000 crore) for the next five years in its various businesses, including energy and telecom sectors. RIL has already identified 'new partnerships' that will be the core vehicle for its growth initiatives going ahead, after successfully entering into over 50 partnerships over the past five years, including a tie-up with global energy giant BP. Commenting on RIL's sale of 30 per cent stake in its 23 oil and gas blocks to BP, HSBC said that RIL faces an &amp;quot;abundance of cash&amp;quot; situation post this transaction. &amp;quot;RIL has already received USD two billion and another USD 5.2 billion is expected to come in over the next 12 months.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We believe RIL will be more eager to deploy this surplus cash, rather than return it to shareholders. Hence it is possible there will be announcements regarding acquisitions and the potential faster roll out of its telecom venture,&amp;quot; it added. RIL's cash balance nearly doubled to a record high level of over Rs 42,000 crore in the last fiscal ended March 31, while its very low debt-equity ratio can allow the group to borrow further funds for various businesses. Last year, RIL had raised USD 1.5 billion of debt in dollar-denominated bonds at very competitive rates and talks are already on for overseas borrowing of an equal amount.  In its report, HSBC said that it expects the RIL management to now &amp;quot;take an active role in the rollout of its broadband business having already invested (about) USD three billion a year back. &amp;quot;Additionally, with limited opportunity in India for deployment of capital, we would also expect RIL to pursue overseas acquisitions with increased intensity, else there would be increasing pressure on the RIL board to return a part of the cash to shareholders&amp;quot;. HSBC also said the management's time would be less burdened with existing businesses, as the issue of falling gas production would be taken care of by the combined BP-RIL team.&amp;amp;nbsp;Therefore, the management would be able to spend more time on &amp;quot;future growth vehicles like broadband and potential acquisitions&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The downstream businesses are running smoothly, with strong leadership teams in place, and do not require day-to-day intervention from decision-makers,&amp;quot; it added.&amp;amp;nbsp;The group is said to be working on various businessexpansion strategies for different segments and a consolidated view of these initiatives could be announced by Mukesh Ambani at RIL's June 3 AGM in Mumbai. In last year's AGM on June 18, 2010, Ambani had said that he was aiming to double the group's enterprise value in less than a decade, from an estimated USD 80 billion (Rs 3,70,000 crore) at that time. RIL's revenue rose by 29% during 2010-11 fiscal to Rs 258,651 crore, while its net profit increased by 25% to Rs 20,286 crore during the period. For the financial business, RIL has been approached by a number of global giants, while talks are also on for tie-ups with international players in the telecom arena.&amp;amp;nbsp;Global investment major DE Shaw Group has already beenroped in and names like American Express are doing the rounds for financial services business partnerships.

Hardy, an India-focused explorer which recently sold its Nigerian assets, expects its profit this year to remain flat as the company will not bring any new wells on stream for production, Finance Director Dinesh Dattani told Reuters. It posted a calendar 2010 pretax profit of USD 2.2 million. Hardy expects production to increase to about 7,000 barrels of oil per day in 2012, after it drills more wells at the PY3 licence. Current production from the licence, where it has an 18% interest, averages about 3,300 bopd. &amp;quot;We have quadrupled reserves (here) since 1999. Now we're at a stage of further development,&amp;quot; Chief Executive Yogeshwar Sharma told Reuters. Hardy shares the PY3 licence with Indian state-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Hindustan Oil Exploration and industrial conglomerate Tata Group. The company, which had capital expenditure of more than USD 6 million last year, sees that increasing to USD 7-8 million this year as it drills two wells at the D9 block in the Bay of Bengal.  Not in talk for sale Hardy dismissed recent speculation it was an attractive bid target, saying it was not in talks with any company regarding a potential sale. &amp;quot;I'm flattered people were speculating we may be takeover target, but the board has no plans. We're not in discussions with anybody,&amp;quot; Sharma said. In March, analysts speculated Hardy Oil could become a potential target after BP tied up with India's Reliance Industries to explore deepwater oil and gas in a USD 7.2 billion deal. BP had bought a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks, including licences D3 and D9, where Hardy holds a 10% interest in each. Shares in Hardy, valued at around 150 million pounds (USD 243 million), have risen by about a third since the BP-Reliance deal was announced in February.  (USD 1 = 0.616 British Pounds)"

Local oil product sales, a proxy for domestic oil demand in Asia's third-largest oil consumer, rose to 12.63 million tonnes in April. In March India's refined fuel consumption rose an annual 4.9%. Also read: Oil price view schism widens after May volatility Demand for diesel is expected to rise in May as vehicles and diesel-fuelled gensets were used for election campaigning. Also, dealers normally maintain high inventory ahead of fuel price hikes. India, which had not raised fuel prices since January to avoid a major voter backlash ahead of polls in five states, raised petrol prices from May 15, a day after ruling Congress or its allies won in three states.  A date is yet to be announced for a meeting of a ministerial panel, earlier scheduled to meet on May 11, to consider raising diesel prices. Demand for petrol could ease in May after a record 8.6% or Rs 5 per litre increase in prices and softening growth in car sales. Car sales in India, a key indicator for petrol consumption, rose at their lowest pace in two years in April as higher interest rates, fuel prices and vehicle costs crimped demand in the world's second-fastest growing auto market.  India's crude oil imports rose 5.9% in April from a year earlier to 15.84 million tonnes or 3.87 million barrels per day (bpd). Crude imports would rise this fiscal to March 2012 given that India has commissioned a 120,000-bpd refinery at Bina in the central state of Madhya Pradesh and is expected to start another 180,000-bpd plant at Bathinda in the north in June. The data for imports and exports could change as it includes estimates for Reliance Industries 580,000 bpd export focussed plant. Diesel exports rose 10.6% to 1.52 million tonnes last month, while petrol exports were up 5.8% from a year ago. Oil products import rose 48% while exports rose 10.2% from a year ago."

Reliance was &amp;quot;deeply concerned and surprised&amp;quot; by the reservoir behaviour and &amp;quot;its deviation from what was envisaged in the Field Development Plan (laid out in 2006)&amp;quot;, Reliance Senior Vice-President (Commercial) B Ganguly said in an April 30 letter to the DGH. &amp;quot;Our concern is also evident from the fact that we have moved to bring in a more experienced partner in the form of (UK's) BP, who brings with it the best deep water experience globally,&amp;quot; he wrote, adding that Reliance plans to discuss the reservoir performance with BP to find a solution to the problem. The Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH) had commissioned independent consultant P Gopalkrishnan to give a report on the reasons for gas output from the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields in the KG-D6 block falling to 42 million cubic metres per day from 53-54 mmscmd in March, 2010, instead of rising to the projected 61.88 mmscmd. In his letter, Ganguly gave a point-by-point rebuttal of Gopalkrishnan's finding that the &amp;quot;shortfall of gas production is due to non-drilling of the adequate number of wells&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;While the DGH-appointed consultant has reached certain conclusions on the performance of the D-1 and D-3 fields, we as operators were neither approached nor afforded an opportunity to discuss any of the field issues with the consultant,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;The consultant had not even visited the field to apprise himself of the actual conditions and field performance,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The conclusions are further contrary to the facts and information provided by us from time-to-time to the DGH.&amp;quot;The DGH is using this report to make Reliance carry out the impossible task of drilling two wells by next month and another nine by the fiscal-end. This despite the fact that each well takes up to six months to be completed and there was a very small weather window available for drilling in the Bay of Bengal. The regulator is mulling over the action it can take against Reliance for failing to meet this commitment, sources said. Ganguly stated that Reliance neither had access to the consultant nor was the full report prepared by Gopalkrishnan ever provided to the company. &amp;quot;From the conclusions that have been conveyed to us, it seems that the consultant either has not been provided or has not considered all reservoir/production data or it would not have been difficult for him to appreciate some very obvious reservoir pressure trends in the field that contradict the conclusions reached by the consultant,&amp;quot; he wrote."

Also, they wanted another nine wells to go on stream before the end of the fiscal in March 2012.

At the meeting, Canada's Niko Resources, which owns 10 per cent interest in Reliance-operated KG-D6 block, rejected DGH suggestions to drill well outside the main reservoir channel as economically unjustified.

They also provided the technical reasons related to the reservoir complexities with reservoir behaviour being different from what was envisaged/considered at the time of 2006 FDP leading to delayed drilling of wells compared to the FDP. DGH representative, according to the minutes, remarked that the Reliance has drilled wells in the main channel area where 40% of the reserves are present and additional wells will have to be drilled in the remaining 60% of the outside channel area.

Gas prices, including that from D-6, will have to be market determined, Ambani was qouted as saying. Taking a shot at policies, he said the government will have to justify why private power, fertilizer and other industries should be subsidized from public money. This pricing policy goes against the principle of maximizing benefit to the parties involved in the production-sharing contract. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, S P Tulsian of sptulsian.com said, &amp;quot;Corporate announcements from RIL indicate that there&amp;amp;nbsp;could be a&amp;amp;nbsp;ramp up in gas output only if the technical glitches&amp;amp;nbsp;are solved quickly.&amp;quot; More on the anvil Completely trusting in the India growth story and the consumption theory, Ambani is looking at the present scenario as an opportunity in acceleration mode.

Reliance has been looking to expand beyond its core businesses into telecom, retail, power, financial services, hospitality and homeland security, the firm had said earlier. &amp;quot;We will make RIL one of the world's largest players in rubber as the whole tyre industry moves to Asia,&amp;quot; Ambani told the paper. The big trend is that if you look at next 10 years, the projections for automobile growth is all China, India and Asia focused,&amp;quot; the billionaire said, adding that Reliance would be a supplier and not a tyre maker. The company is also looking at strategic alliances in the energy and consumer sectors, Ambani said. Reliance struck three shale gas joint ventures in the United States last year, including a USD 1.7 billion deal with Atlas Energy to own 40% of its Marcellus Shale operations in the eastern United States. Ambani said he strongly believes India would be a USD 5-trillion economy well before 2025, and that it would have a USD 2.5-trillion consumption market. &amp;quot;I think the India growth story is unstoppable. I look at it as an opportunity in the acceleration mode,&amp;quot; he said. India needs a supportive governance environment at all levels and systemic reforms to reduce corruption, he said. Ambani also said the company was confident of ramping up gas output at its key block off India's east coast and that all gas prices, including D6, has to be market-determined. On Monday, India's upstream regulator said gas production from Reliance's KG-D6 field had fallen further and the company had been asked to drill 11 new wells by April 1, 2012, to boost output. The concerns over Reliance's gas production have for months dampened growth outlook for the Indian energy giant and kept its shares under pressure. The company, which has agreed a broad partnership with multinational BP on field development in a deal worth USD 7.2 billion, said in March it wanted to work to overcome &amp;quot;the technical challenge involved in these complex reservoirs&amp;quot;.  Reliance, India's largest listed firm, posted a record quarterly profit last month, but still missed forecasts due to flat production from gas blocks and lower-than-expected refining margins. "

It also accorded moderate ratings on RIL's long-term Foreign Currency and Local Currency issuer default rating, while revising upwards the outlook on the latter to positive from stable. &amp;quot;Fitch Ratings has affirmed India-based RIL's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating at 'BBB-', long-term local currency IDR at 'BBB' and national long-term rating at 'AAA(ind)',&amp;quot; Fitch said in a statement. &amp;quot;The ratings continue to reflect RIL's strong business profile in the oil and gas business with vertical diversification across the supply chain (upstream, refining and petrochemicals), its efficient refining operations and its dominant position in the Indian petrochemicals sector,&amp;quot; Fitch said. The 'AAA' national ratings denote the highest rating assigned by the agency and is assigned to issuers or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk. A 'BBB' denote a moderate default risk relative. It added that the rating has also taken into account RIL's scale of operations in key product lines, its record of robust cash flow from operations and the company's strong liquidity position. &amp;quot;The local currency IDR outlook revision reflects the likelihood of RIL's credit metrics strengthening further, subject to the closure of its proposed deal with BP Plc and no major investment being announced,&amp;quot; Fitch said. In February, RIL entered into an agreement to sell 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks to global energy giant BP for USD 7.2 billion.

It has a strong liquidity position with cash equivalents of around USD 7.1 billion at December-end, 2010, which will increase if the BP deal closes,&amp;quot; Fitch added.

The sector has started to catch up with India's world-famous IT and services industry to sate demand for anything from cars to air-conditioners to flat-screen TVs in the homes of hundreds of millions of newly affluent Indians who are ready to splurge. The potential is vast for the likes of LG, which plans to double its India revenue in just four years pumping out appliances every few seconds at its factory outside New Delhi, products that were seen as rare luxuries before economic liberalisation. But creaky infrastructure, erratic policies and a shortage of skilled labour mean factory growth has yet to emerge from the shadows of neighbouring China's prowess. Manufacturing makes up about a third of China's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to a 16%&amp;amp;nbsp;share in India, the same as it was 20 years ago. New Delhi has set an ambitious target to raise that figure to 25% in a decade. &amp;quot;Manufacturers are becoming optimistic, but my feeling is that a huge level of manufacturing coming to India has still too many challenges,&amp;quot; said LG's Chief Operating Officer Yasho Verma. &amp;quot;This type of factory is OK. But if suppose LG decides tomorrow it should have 20 factories in India, then it's a major problem,&amp;quot; he said in an interview at LG's plant. The trade ministry has raised &amp;quot;serious concern&amp;quot; that the current account deficit may become unsustainable as India's trade deficit is set to balloon to USD 278.5 billion by 2014, a twenty-fold increase over a decade from the USD 14.3 billion in 2004. &amp;quot;A large widening of the trade deficit can potentially result in payments difficulties,&amp;quot; it said in a recent strategy document. &amp;quot;Such a situation is simply unacceptable because it may jeopardize the entire growth process.&amp;quot; India can no longer rely on a mix of its IT and service sector heft, remittances from its citizens working overseas and capital flows to finance a huge import bill of one of the world's fastest growing economies. Manufacturing may need to plug the gap and provide jobs for the tens of millions expected to enter the workforce in the next decade who cannot be absorbed in farming or IT and services. &amp;quot;If India is to achieve its stated goals on GDP growth and more importantly, to generate higher levels of employment for the growing young population, India's manufacturing sector has to enter into a new orbit of even higher growth,&amp;quot; said a report by the Boston Consulting Group, which suggested India's manufacturing sector should aim to grow an annual 11 percent. &amp;quot;If India has to target a high growth of 11% for its manufacturing sector over next 15 years, it needs to necessarily focus on growing its exports much faster,&amp;quot; it said. The government in February estimated manufacturing growth in the 2010/2011 fiscal year at 8.8%.  Not perfect, but getting better Reuters spoke to four executives from manufacturing firms who have set up shop in India. The consensus was that, while things aren't perfect, they're improving rapidly and India is starting to shed its tag as a manufacturing laggard. A maturing supplier base, the influx of seasoned global firms and an explosion in demand have brought transformation even in the last couple of years to a sector infamous for its red tape, countless licence requirements and pitiful output before liberalisation began in 1991. &amp;quot;I've been here living in the country for 18 months, I've been coming here for 10 years, and I can tell you in the 18 months I've seen a huge difference,&amp;quot; said John Flannery, the India chief executive of General Electric Co. &amp;quot;The things that we would ask or expect of our supply chain today are quite different than what we could even think about two years ago. So it's changing very quickly,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;You look at the best companies today, the best manufacturing companies today, they're very very sophisticated. And you wouldn't have seen that 5-10 years ago.&amp;quot; Indian suppliers no longer work on the principle of &amp;quot;jugaad&amp;quot; -- a Hindi word for muddling through problems with quick fixes that flourished during the days of the so-called &amp;quot;Licence Raj&amp;quot; -- which had created a culture of short-termism and inefficiency, LG's Verma said. A more sophisticated supplier base makes it simpler and cheaper for foreign firms to set up factories on Indian soil and even look to India as a major exporter further down the line. Cars leaving the assembly line of General Motors in India are now up to 98% locally produced, designed with the help of 2,000 engineers in the company's Bangalore offices. Hyundai Motor Co has made India an export hub for its vehicles. From 20 Santros sold to Nepal in 1999, the firm exported 247,102 &amp;quot;Made in India&amp;quot; cars globally last year, the highest number in any country outside the company's native South Korea.  Policy, infrastructure hurdles But India's infrastructure development has not kept pace with the demands of its manufacturing. Power is in short supply, highways are clogged with traffic and ports are too crowded. The average cost to move a container within India is USD 945, more than double the USD 460 it costs in China. Due to restrictions on goods traffic, Hyundai can only ship cars from its Chennai plant to the coast for seven hours at night, said Arvind Saxena, a director of Hyundai Motor India. &amp;quot;Infrastructure has improved ... but yes, a lot still needs to be done,&amp;quot; he said. LG's Verma would like to see the government adopt China-style policies to foster growth of Indian suppliers. &amp;quot;The Chinese government has spent a huge lot of money, creating cities where the vendors will be placed, creating infrastructure there,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Those things are not in focus in India.&amp;quot; Companies have also grappled with slow or inconsistent policy decisions from the Indian government. For example, five years ago New Delhi rolled out a policy for so-called Special Economic Zones (SEZs), hubs with long tax holidays that were set up in Beijing's footsteps to spur manufacturing growth. But the finance ministry slapped a 18.5% duty on book profits in the zones in February's budget, sparking criticism from the trade ministry that the tax would send the wrong signal about India's credibility with investors.  Karl Slym, the head of GM India, cheers what he sees as largely business-friendly policies from the government for auto makers. But some decisions from New Delhi come out of the blue and catch investors unawares, he said. &amp;quot;Nobody has the chance to be able to respond correctly or be able to manage the situation,&amp;quot; Slym told Reuters. &amp;quot;If you know what the outlook is, what the playing field is, then you can plan accordingly for that. But if you start out playing football on a football field and then all of a sudden you're trying to play on a cricket field then you've got the wrong equipment to be able to perform the best,&amp;quot; he added. Whatever its problems, the four companies interviewed by Reuters remain largely optimistic on India's manufacturing rise. And as global firms look to ride India's 9% growth story, Asia's third-largest economy has also flexed its export muscle with the growth of domestic brands. The trade ministry has set India a target to double its exports by 2014 to help keep the deficit in check. No longer known just for its iconic exports such as textiles and gems, India's manufacturers are becoming household names in sectors such as cars, generic medicines and oil products. Reliance Industries, owned by tycoon Mukesh Ambani, operates the world's biggest oil refining complex. India's Tata Group is Britain's biggest manufacturing employer. &amp;quot;The overall long term growth for the country, the capabilities within the country, far outweigh any short-term issues,&amp;quot; GM's Slym said. &amp;quot;They're just hindrances.&amp;quot;"

Asia's third-largest economy needs private capital for exploration and is encouraging local firms to buy stakes in foreign oil and gas projects to meet its surging energy needs. India imports over 70% of the crude it uses and is keen to tap quickly domestic reservoirs. Global oil firms are more inclined to invest in countries with higher prospects for finds, but India's position has also suffered because of bureaucratic sloth. &amp;quot;Prospectivity is the key issue ... But India can be a difficult country to do business in. There's the issue of bureaucracy,&amp;quot; said Sara Pourghorbani, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie for India. &amp;quot;Bureaucracy actually seems to be quite a major issue for India. The pace of decision-making is quite slow,&amp;quot; Pourghorbani added. Monday's auction largely drew interest from international companies that already operate in India such as BG, BHP Billiton and Cairn Energy. Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy called the response to the auction &amp;quot;more than satisfactory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;very encouraging&amp;quot;. BP, which has just bought a 30% stake in 23 Indian blocks owned by Reliance, did not put in a bid. BG, with BHP Billiton, applied for and won only one block.  Tightening scrutiny India is competing with big oil-producing countries worldwide for exploration interest that could help it achieve energy self-sufficiency. The situation has been exacerbated by a regulatory backlash as the government tightens scrutiny of projects to contain the political fallout of massive corruption cases. Oil Secretary S Sundareshan told reporters that contracts for the new blocks could be signed within three months. A total of 34 blocks were initially on offer under the ninth licensing round, but one shallow water block received no bids. The winning bids have to be endorsed by India's cabinet. Of the 33 blocks, eight are deepwater, six shallow water and 19 onshore blocks. Official data showed that foreign firms, including Deep Energy of the United States, had won five blocks, while the rest were bagged by Indian companies, repeating a pattern seen in previous rounds. A consortium led by state-run explorer ONGC had provisionally won 10 blocks, and Reliance Industries had won two blocks. The blocks are being offered under India's New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP), which was launched in 1999 offering more attractive terms to boost higher investment in the oil and gas sector of Asia's third-largest oil consumer. India is currently producing around 720,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, mostly from fields awarded decades ago -- less than a quarter of its 3.18 million bpd demand. Proven oil reserves amounted to 5.8 billion barrels in 2009 -- enough only to satisfy its oil needs for about five years, according to the BP Statistical Review. Indian oil firms are seeking foreign expertise to tap into the country's largely unexplored deep offshore water, which will require billions of dollars of investment. The previous eight rounds have been dominated by Indian firms, with ONGC and Oil India bagging more that half of total 234 blocks awarded.

Concerns over Reliance's gas production have for months dampened the growth outlook for the Indian energy giant, despite the company posting its highest-ever quarterly profit in January as refining margins surged.

BPCL Chairman RK Singh said his firm has decided to defer a planned April shutdown of units at its plants, while Hindustan Petroleum is also considering delaying maintenance from April. The country's diesel demand, which peaks in the summer, is expected to be even higher this year as five key states hold elections from April and the fuel will be used extensively in transport on top of power generation. &amp;quot;Current diesel demand growth is around 10%&amp;amp;nbsp;and it will rise further in next two months mainly due to higher demand from agriculture and for transportation due to elections,&amp;quot; said GC Daga, head of marketing at Indian Oil Corp. India's domestic diesel sales, which make up over a third of refined products consumption, rose an annual 6.3% in January. . Refiners who had scheduled maintenance for April had been looking for at least 400,000 tonnes of imports in the month -- sharply up from about 110,000 tonnes bought in January. Last week, IOC could not get price offers for a diesel tender and had to abandon it while Bharat Petroleum had to pay a hefty premium for importing just one of the four cargoes it had sought. Gasoil prices internationally are likely to stay firm, underpinned by Japan's need for diesel imports as it gets reconstruction underway after a massive earthquake and tsunami. Asian gas oil swaps hit a two-and-half year peak over USD 24 a barrel last week although they have since weakened slighty, with cracks below USD 23 a barrel now as some Japan refineries restarted and run rates increased. &amp;quot;I am a state-run firm, I have to run for the country,&amp;quot; said BN Bankapur, head of refineries at IOC, adding if required his firm would defer shutdown plans. &amp;quot;It makes sense for state refiners to defer their shutdown plans as the monsoon arrives in Kerala in the first week of June and reaches Mumbai in the the latter part of the month, reducing demand for transportation fuel,&amp;quot; said an industry expert.  No change for private refineries Private refiners Essar Oil and Reliance Industries, which prefer to sell diesel to state-run firms than make direct sales as they don't get federal compensation for sale of fuel at government-capped prices, plan to go ahead with scheduled shutdowns. An Essar Oil spokesman said as of now there was no change in plans to shut completely the Vadinar refinery in western Gujarat state in May-June for 35 days for maintenance and expanding capacity to 360,000 barrels per day (bpd). A source with knowledge of Essar's plans said the shutdown was due from May 15 to June 21. Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar, plans repair work at a vacuum gas oil unit from later this month and at a coker from end-April at its 660,000 bpd plant at the site in the western state of Gujarat. &amp;quot;Reliance will be supplying less diesel to the industry (state-run firms) in April-May, while Essar will be fully shut in May-June,&amp;quot; an HPCL official said. &amp;quot;Reliance should be allowed to sell the fuel to us from its second refinery,&amp;quot; he added. The Indian government levies higher taxes on local supply of fuel from Reliance's only-for-export 580,000 bpd refinery, which is also at Jamnagar. As a result, even though the country has a refining surplus, state-run firms must look overseas to meet local demand. &amp;quot;It is a high time. The government should look at changing policy in such a way that allow export refiners to sell in domestic markets. It will be a win-win situation for all as it would reduce dependence on costly imports,&amp;quot; said Sushant Gupta, an anlyst at Wood Mackenzie."

Reliance has written to the upstream regulator indicating gas output from the D1 and D3 fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin KG-D6 block may fall to 38 million standard cubic metres per day(mscmd) during 2012/13 from 42-43 mscmd now, the source, with knowledge of the letter, said on Friday. &amp;quot;It is an extremely complicated reservoir, much more complicated than was thought to be in the beginning. This is the reason why the company joined hands with BP,&amp;quot; the source said. Last month, Reliance agreed to sell a stake in 23 oil and gas blocks in the basin to BP in a USD 7.2 billion deal, in part to benefit from BP's technical expertise in deepwater exploration. The letter, written last week, said output from MA1, another field in the D6 block, will remain steady around 8-9 mscmd. Reliance said in a statement the figures were &amp;quot;purely provisional and indicative,&amp;quot; adding projections on gas output could vary. Earlier this month, the regulator said Reliance was pumping 53 mscmd from the D6 block -- already less than the 60mscmd it produced last year, and far off peak capacity of 80 mscmd. Concerns over the group's gas production have for months dampened the growth outlook for the Indian energy giant, despite the company posting its highest-ever quarterly profit in January as refining margins surged. Officials at the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons did not respond to calls. &amp;quot;Our current estimates assume KG-D6 gas production at 60 mscmd both in FY12 and FY13. Every 10% change in gross output impacts our FY13 earnings per share by 1.4%,&amp;quot; RBS analyst Avadhoot Sabnis said in a research note on Friday. India's director-general of hydrocarbons said earlier in March that Reliance Industries' gas output could go up to 67 mscmd by April, as per its field development plan, if it drills four more wells by next month. Shares in Reliance, which is the heaviest-weighted stock on India's main Sensex index, fell the most in nearly 11 months and shed 3.7% to Rs 993.15 at the close, wiping around USD 2.8 billion off its value. The Sensex ended down 1.5%. Reliance stock was the fourth-most traded on the National Stock Exchange and had a total volume of around 11.1 million shares traded on both BSE and NSE, nearly twice its 90-day average daily volume. One trader suggested concerns might be overdone. &amp;quot;It looks like Reliance is trying to push for increasing the (capital expenditure). The fears of a decline in output are only a possible scenario. It looks like the market has overreacted,&amp;quot; said Deven Choksey, managing director at Mumbai's KR Choksey Shares &amp;amp;amp; Securities."

India, which has a total installed power generation capacity of 164 gigawatts (GW), aims to raise it to 187 GW by the end of March 2012, a modest target given a 12% peak-hour power shortfall that crimps its near 9% economic growth. According to the deal valid May 31, Reliance will supply nearly 2.6 million cubic metres a day (mmscmd) of gas, currently used by customers in Gujarat, to power producers in Andhra Pradesh from Friday, Oil Minister Jaipal Reddy said. In return, state-run GAIL will transmit an equal amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to customers in Gujarat, Reddy said, adding that the move would lead to additional generation of about 600 megawatt of power. The move to swap gas was considered as Andhra Pradesh did not have pipeline connectivity to LNG plants in Gujarat. Domestic supply of natural gas has risen significantly after Reliance started pumping from its deep-sea D6 block in Andhra Pradesh in 2009. Gujarat customers would continue to pay the price of D6 gas, while Andhra Pradesh power utility will pay for imported LNG price. GAIL Chairman B.C. Tripathi said his firm would supply spot LNG to Gujarat based customers. GAIL has signed a deal to import 0.5 million tonnes of LNG from Marubeni.  India, which imports over two-thirds of the oil it consumes, is actively encouraging the use of natural gas to reduce reliance on costly oil imports. Andhra Pradesh has gas-based power generation capacity of 2,700 MW but due to inadequate pipeline infrastructure produces only about 1900 MW."

State-run IOC raised capacity of its Panipat plant in northern India by a quarter in 2010, taking total capacity to 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) and emerging as India's biggest refiner ahead of private sector Reliance Industries. Reliance's Jamnagar complex, the biggest in the world, has a total capacity to process 1.24 million bpd. IOC will import 18% or 40,000 bpd more crude from Iraq in 2011 than a year ago, the sources said, as it has upgraded secondary units at its plants to enable production of Euro III and Euro IV compliant fuel in 2010. Euro III and IV are low sulphur content, cleaner fuels. Iraq's national oil company SOMO would supply 13 million tonnes or 260,000 bpd crude oil in 2011, the sources said, adding estimated total high sulphur crude imports by the company in the next fiscal would be 620,000 bpd. &amp;quot;IOC has raised imports from Iraq possibly to counter shortfall if any from Iran. Also Basrah is a proven grade and reasonably competitive with respect to other Middle East grades given that IOC has secondary units capable of taking medium-sour oil,&amp;quot; said an Asian oil trader. India and Iran are locked in discussions after Reserve Bank of India said in December that payments to Tehran could no longer be settled using a clearing system run by regional central banks, putting at risk imports of Iranian oil.  Oil minister Jaipal Reddy said earlier this month New Delhi had paid 1.5 billion euros (USD 2.08 billion) to clear pending dues for oil imports from Iran, the second-biggest oil supplier to India after Saudi Arabia.  IOC is still planning to keep imports from Iran under term deals unchanged for the next fiscal year at 30,000 bpd.  IOC's low-sulphur crude oil imports through term deals will be reduced by 7.2% to 130,000 bpd, as its 10,000-bpd deal to buy Tunisia's Zarzaitine grade from Algeria's Sonatrach has not been renewed for the next fiscal, the sources said.  The Indian refiner regularly buys sweet grades mainly from West Africa through spot tenders while it relies on term volumes to meet its sour grade requirements. IOC's head of finance and international trade SV Narasimhan was not immediately available for comment. IOC buys Girassol, Cabinda and Nemba from Angola, Labuan and Miri Light from Malaysia's Petronas, Seria Light from Brunei Shell Petroleum Co and Upper Zakum grade from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. To get Nigerian crudes of its choice, it awards a crude swap tender every year. "

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Satish Chandra, CMD, Madras Fertilisers gave his perspective and expectations on the fertiliser secretary's revival proposal for the company. Below is a verbatim transcript. Also watch the accompanying video. Q: We spoke post the economic policy and today we have the fertiliser secretary say that we have prepared a revival proposal for Madras Fertilisers, what we could expect in terms of a monetary compensation for the government, how far is this and what is the quantum of your expectation? A: The revival proposal consists of two parts. Part one is financial restructuring and part two technical revamp. In the financial restructuring, there were many creditors for MFL, one was IDBI and they had given us loan earlier and we had one time settlement with them. We had paid the entire amount of Rs 58 crore to them. So there is no loan due to them. Second is on IFCI we have paid Rs 44 crore, and we have also paid Rs 4 crore to small lenders like LIC and Industrial Investment Bank of India (IIBI). The government of India has given us a principal amount of Rs 390 crore and on that interest is around Rs 160 crore. So that is totally Rs 550 crore. As the fertiliser secretary has already told me that we have sent a proposal for the waiver of this loan because once this loan is waived then our balance sheet will be clean and we start with clean balance sheet without any loan overdue. Q: What is the regulatory procedure, you possibly go through for the waiver of this loan of around Rs 550 crore and when could we possibly expect this event to happen? A: This will happen very shortly because we have prepared a note for Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE) and BRPSE has advised us to seek the comments of other ministries. So we have sent a note to finance, agriculture and planning commission, once we get their comments. We will go to the BRPSE and after their approval, we need to go to CCEA, which altogether may take around 4-5 months. So we are hopeful of getting this. This is one proposal. In the meanwhile, the second for revamp and this rehabilitation of the old plant, we need around Rs 365 crore. Q: How are you going to fund this Rs 365 crore? A: The government is giving us a loan amount of Rs 365 crore. Already the implementation of the Rs 365 crore proposal has started from the year "

Asia's fourth-largest economy is expanding at more than 8 percent a year. But it struggles to pump even a third of the oil it guzzles, while gas use -- limited by poor infrastructure -- is already 30% more than production. India has sought to attract the big international players since 1999 with its New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) but still only two foreign companies -- BG and Cairn Energy -- are producing any serious amounts in the country. &amp;quot;This deal brings in one of the majors in a material way. Twenty-three blocks and an important gas play,&amp;quot; said Richard Quin, lead analyst for Middle East, North Africa and India at energy research consultancy Wood Mackenzie. &amp;quot;I suspect the Indian government is very happy about it.&amp;quot; BP, which has only one block, picked up through Indian government auctions, is now paying privately-owned Reliance for a 30% stake in 23 of its blocks, including the big gas producer D6 in the Krishna Godavari basin. The blocks now produce about 1.8 billion cubic feet/day (bcf/d) -- more than 40 percent of India's total production and more than 30 percent of total consumption. The British-based company figures there are at least 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas resources in the blocks -- enough to meet India's current rate of consumption for seven years. It is BP's biggest investment in exploration and production in Asia, with a potential total of USD 20 billion linked to exploration successes. &amp;quot;It would be wrong to downplay the prospectivity of the 23 blocks. There has to be a reason BP bought in. Fundamentally, BP is in the business of producing hydrocarbons,&amp;quot; Quin said. At the same time, BP could use its technical expertise to boost output at Reliance's D6 block. It is India's biggest gas find but output has slipped because of technical problems to about 52 million cubic metres a day (mcm/d) from 60 mcm/d in October and short of a target 80 mcm/d. Reliance will benefit from the tie-up with BP by being able to take advantage of BP's technical capabilities, analysts said, in turn enhancing the valuation of India's biggest company's existing assets. BP India head Sashi Mukundan would not be drawn on future output estimates. Scorching inflation, soaring demand&amp;amp;nbsp; The chance to boost domestic production has clear attractions for India's coalition government as it struggles to balance the need for growth to help half a billion people out of poverty with pressure to keep a lid on scorching fuel and food inflation. BP expects gas demand in India to grow nearly five percent per year to 2030 -- slightly slower than the economy's current pace near 9 percent. Consumption, limited by creaky infrastructure, should exceed 15 bcf/d by then, according to BP. Wood Mackenzie is more conservative but still expects demand to hit 13.18 bcf/d in 2030 from 5.34 bcf/d in 2010. But New Delhi will have to ease controls on pricing in order to ensure new, potentially more expensive, output comes onstream. &amp;quot;New discoveries would need a higher gas price than is currently being charged for the D6 gas (USD 4.2/mmbtu),&amp;quot; RBS analysts said in a research note. BP's Mukundan said the market could support higher prices. &amp;quot;Latent demand is being fully utilised and ... new demand will be created on market fundamentals. It's not going to be based on subsidy regime,&amp;quot; he said. Oil and gas prices internationally are near record highs but in India, the government controls pricing and subsidises output from older fields operated by state-run companies in an attempt to foster industrial growth and cushion its poorest voters. The country's population is the second-biggest in the world but half a billion people have under USD 1.25 a day to live on. BP and Reliance are also planning to join together to source and market gas in India -- likely to focus on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and potentially the construction of a terminal, giving even more choice for the energy-starved economy. &amp;quot;India will definitely benefit from this deal as Reliance Industries could invest ... for development of infrastructure,&amp;quot; Amrit Pandurangi, senior director at Deloitte India, said. Cairn caution&amp;amp;nbsp; India's upstream regulator was even more enthusiastic. &amp;quot;For the country it is a very, very positive signal. This will give a massive boost to investment to India,&amp;quot; said SK Srivastva, head of India's upstream regulator, he Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. &amp;quot;Other global majors will also realise now that India provides a favourable and safe business environment,&amp;quot; for exploration and production, he added. But whether India can now attract other energy firms to look again at its hydrocarbons may depend instead on the outcome of another multi-billion dollar investment -- Vedanta Resources' bid to buy control of Cairn Energy's assets. The acquisition has been bogged down over royalty issues with state-run partner Oil and Natural Gas Corp for six months and now India's cabinet has got involved, potentially triggering further delays. Industry experts were optimistic, however, with Wood Mackenzie's Quin seeing Reliance's presence as a big plus. &amp;quot;Aligning with Reliance is an important part of the equation. They can get things done in India,&amp;quot; he said."

Domestic refiners processed 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd) oil in January, government data showed on Thursday, as global refining margins recovered in the month and refiners stepped up runs to meet growing local fuel demand. Output from Reliance's 660,000 bpd plant at Jamnagar in western Gujarat state rose 10.2%, recovering from an annual 0.8% decline in December. February refinery output should also continue to rise but the rate of growth might slow as Reliance had shut a fluid catalytic cracker during the month for maintenance. State refiners are not planning any major maintenance shutdowns in the March quarter. Output of state refiners rose an annual 8.6% in January. Reliance, whose two refineries in western India account for over a third of the country's refining capacity, does not report throughput data for its 580,000-bpd export-focused Jamnagar refinery to the government. The country's crude oil output during the month rose 10.8% to about 765,250 bpd -- still a fraction of the overall needs of the world's fourth-biggest crude importer. Natural gas output declined 6.3% to 4.35 billion cubic metres from a year ago. Oil and gas output was less in January versus December due to a leak in an undersea pipeline linked to India's biggest oil fields in the western offshore sector. "

The UK-based oil major has announced plans to buy a 30% stake in 23 of Reliance's oil and gas exploration blocks in India and the two firms have decided to form an equal joint venture for sourcing and marketing of gas.  The sources on Tuesday said under the deal, signed in the December quarter, Reliance would import a cargo every month from April and buy regassified LNG equivalent to a spot cargo from the 3.6 million tonne a year Hazira terminal on the west coast. &amp;quot;Reliance needs gas for its plants as its D6 (producing block) gas is mainly allocated to other companies,&amp;quot; one of the sources said, on condition of anonymity. Reliance needs gas for west India based Jamanagar refining complex that can process 1.24 million barrels per day -- the biggest in the world -- and its petrochemical plant. Royal Dutch Shell through its unit Shell Gas owns a 74% stake in Hazira LNG, while Total Gaz Electricite France, a unit of France's Total, holds the remainder. No comment was available from Reliance and Hazira LNG. It is not clear if the LNG cargoes will be imported by the joint venture or the Indian firm alone. The joint venture should be operational in three to six months, BP India head Sashi Mukundan said last week, to meet growing demand in the world's second-fastest growing major economy.  According to BP's Energy Outlook 2030, India's daily gas consumption in 2010 was estimated at 6.1 billion cubic feet (bcf) and is expected to exceed 15 bcf in 2030."

Sashi Mukundan told Reuters gas prices in the Indian market had the potential to rise and, if necessary, the two companies would build a terminal to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) to take advantage of an increasing appetite for market-priced gas. &amp;quot;BP's estimate today is that (the 23 blocks) have 15 tcf gas resources ... there is a much larger running room and our coming into this (shows) we believe that we can jointly significantly improve the production,&amp;quot; he said in an interview on Thursday. Reliance's D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin off the east coast is India's biggest gas producer, but output has slipped on technical problems to about 52 million cubic metres a day (mcmd) from 60 mcmd in 2010 and short of a target 80 mcmd. Mukundan was speaking to Reuters a day after arriving back from Britain where the companies signed the deal -- the biggest foreign direct investment in India's exploration sector. The Indian partnership marks the second major deal under BP's new chief executive Bob Dudley, who last month agreed a share swap with Russia's state-controlled Rosneft to jointly explore the Arctic for offshore oil and gas. It is BP's biggest investment in exploration and production space in Asia and plants it firmly in the fourth of the emerging BRIC economies along with operations in Brazil and China, after it picked up little in Indian government licensing rounds. &amp;quot;We missed the boat until NELP V,&amp;quot; Mukundan said, adding that in 1999, when India launched its New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), gas prices were too low and the potential of the country was not widely known. Cairn Energy, which picked up blocks in India before the launch of NELP, is currently trying to sell a majority stake in its Indian arm Cairn India to Vedanta Resources but is bogged down in a royalty dispute with its Indian partner.  Hindu wedding BP has no current plans to buy into Reliance's coal-bed methane blocks, Mukundan added. &amp;quot;We have seen good shows in Mahanadi, Krishna Godavari and we have seen some shows in Cauvery, which we now look to build upon ... there is a potential for us to significantly grow,&amp;quot; he said. Mukundan said the deal was exclusive to both the companies and they could jointly look at further alliances. &amp;quot;This is a Hindu wedding. This will last forever. That's the plan,&amp;quot; he said, when asked about the duration of the tie-up. The equal joint venture between the two companies for marketing and sourcing of gas should be operational in three to six months, Mukundan said, to meet growing demand in the world's second-fastest growing major economy. &amp;quot;The (gas pricing) trend is upward ... the market has appetite for higher priced gas,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Latent demand is being fully utilised and ... new demand will be created on market fundamentals. It's not going to be based on subsidy regime.&amp;quot; India approves the gas sales pricing formula from more recent fields while older fields awarded to state-run firms have a subsidised price of USD 4.2/million British thermal unit (mbtu). Mukundan said that 25-30% of India's gas consumption is met by imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) which is sold at a much higher price and added that the government could agree higher prices for future field developments. &amp;quot;The government is flexible to look at each of the blocks on its own merit. There is a discussion that some of the more difficult blocks will probably end up with higher pricing.&amp;quot; He said the joint venture could build an LNG terminal and pipelines if it could not find capacity at India's existing facilities. &amp;quot;If we can't get it and we still need to get it, we'll look at the possibility of building our own terminal if needed.&amp;quot;"

(RIL) to positive from stable.,,"Business, Reliance Industries, RIL, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sp-revises-ril-outlook-to-positive_525735.html,"Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor's Ratings Services revised its outlook on India-based Reliance Industries (RIL) to positive from stable. At the same time, we affirmed the 'BBB' long-term corporate credit rating on RIL and the 'BBB' issue rating on the company's senior unsecured notes. We revised the outlook to positive to reflect our expectation that RIL's financial profile would improve and that the company's exposure to India's country risk would reduce after its proposed partnership with BP PLC (A/Negative/A-1). RIL plans to sell 30% of its stake in 23 oil and gas production sharing contracts in India, including KG-D6, to BP for USD 7.2 billion in cash. The company will receive the amount over the next 10-12 months, subject to necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction would significantly improve its liquidity position, resulting in lower debt (after adjusting for cash and cash equivalents of more than USD 1.5 billion). Lower debt, in turn, would improve RIL's ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDA to less than 0.5x for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. We also expect BP's significant experience and capabilities of managing deepwater exploration and development operations to help RIL improve its exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) business in India. The operating performance of RIL's E&amp;amp;amp;P business had weakened in the past two quarters. &amp;quot;The outlook revision also reflects our expectation that RIL will begin to generate positive free operating cash flows (FOCF); the company has had negative FOCF for the past five years,&amp;quot; said Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor's credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala. &amp;quot;This is because funds from operations have increased to about USD 6 billion to USD 6.5 billion whereas capital expenditure is expected to be about USD 5 billion annually. The improvement in cash flows is on account of the improvement in RIL's operating performance.&amp;quot; RIL's liquidity is strong with cash and cash equivalents of USD 7.1 billion as at December 31, 2010. This is more than enough to cover long-term debt maturities of about Rs 5,000 crore due in one year and short-term debt of&amp;amp;nbsp; Rs 14,900 crore on as at December 31, 2010. RIL's liquidity position would further strengthen after it receives the cash consideration from BP. The company also has unused working capital credit facilities of about INR300 billion, good access to financial markets, and treasury stocks of about US&amp;amp;#36;6.5 billion. We believe that the sale of treasury stocks is a quicker way to raise funds than selling fresh equity. Large cash flows from operations further support RIL's liquidity position, as these are sufficient to meet the company's capital expenditure requirements. The positive outlook reflects our expectation that RIL's financial profile would improve after the proposed partnership with BP. It also reflects our view that the company's operating performance will improve and that the proposed partnership will preserve its competitive position in the E&amp;amp;amp;P business. We could raise the rating if we believe RIL's management is less aggressive in its growth plans and we expect that the company will maintain a modest financial profile by: (1) consistently generating positive FOCF; and (2) maintaining a conservative financial policy with a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDA at less than 1x. We could revise the outlook to stable if RIL shifts back to an aggressive growth strategy, resulting in a higher-than-expected capital expenditure or the company makes a large acquisition that drains its liquidity or increases its debt. The outlook could also be revised to stable if: (1) RIL makes a large investment in a regulated business in India, such as power; (2) the proposed partnership with BP does not materialize; or (3) we lower India's transfer and convertibility assessment to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'."

BP will take a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks and form a 50:50 joint venture with Reliance for the sourcing and marketing of gas, the companies said on Monday. The companies said the future performance payments and the combined investment could amount to USD 20 billion in total. India, one of the world's fastest growing major economies, needs foreign capital to boost infrastructure and sustain economic growth at its near-double-digit targets. Regulatory uncertainty and bureaucratic hurdles, however, have contributed to a slowdown in inbound investment. In the fiscal year that ends in March, India is on track to bring in USD 27.6 billion in FDI inflows, down from USD 35.6 billion in the previous year, a senior official said on Monday. Below are some facts about major foreign investments in India: India's environment ministry last month approved plans by South Korea's POSCO to build a USD 12 billion steel mill, a boost for the foreign investment climate in Asia's third-largest economy after several setbacks for big ticket industrial projects. Vodafone entered India in 2007, paying USD 11.1 billion to buy a 67% controlling stake in Hutchison Whampoa's mobile business in India, in which India's Essar Group is a partner. The deal is the largest inbound foreign direct investment to be completed. Miner Vedanta Resources' planned deal worth up to USD 9.6 billion for control of energy firm Cairn India, slowed by disagreement over royalties, will be decided by India's cabinet, which could delay it further. Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo paid up to USD 4.6 billion in 2008 for control of India's Ranbaxy Laboratories. NTT DoCoMo Inc agreed to pay USD 2.7 billion in 2008 for a 26% stake in Indian telecoms firm Tata Teleservices, giving Japan's top mobile operator a foothold in the world's fastest-growing major mobile market."

BP is buying 30% stake in its 23 out of 29 exploration blocks held by Reliance, for USD 7.2 billion. The transaction, which BP and Reliance said will be &amp;quot;subject to Indian regulatory approvals and other customary conditions,&amp;quot; is nothing but farm-out of interest. Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani said the deal is &amp;quot;of course subject to necessary government approval&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;All blocks (in the deal) are under NELP which has a well laid down framework for government approval. We will apply and get approval,&amp;quot; he told reporters in London. Farm-out of interest under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), the regime under which Reliance won the 23 blocks, is allowed and company farming out (or in simple terms selling out) interest is required to make an application to the regulator Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). Oil Secretary S Sundareshan today said Reliance''s farm- out of stake in the NELP blocks will need government approval. However the nature of the approval will be different from Vedanta Resources'' USD 9.6 billion acquisition of Cairn India as the deal announced today is not transfer of control. In Cairn-Vedanta deal, Cairn Energy Plc of UK is transferring control of its Indian unit to the London-listed mining group, which has no prior experience in oil and gas. The BP-Reliance deal is similar to what Cairn India had done way back in 2004 with ONGC when it farmed-out 90% of its interest and operatorship in gas discovery block of KG-DWN-98/2 which sits next to Reliance''s prolific KG-D6 fields off the Andhra coast. Cairn-ONGC applied and DGH and oil ministry approved it. Unlike the 2004 deal, Reliance is not transferring control or operatorship of the blocks to BP. Reliance said it will retain operatorship of all the 23 blocks including the KG-D6. Also, the major difference lies in the fact that Cairn has itself claimed that its deal with Vedanta is a corporate transaction and not a transfer of stake in the blocks. The corporate transaction, it stated, did not require the permission of government but reluctantly agreed to it. It made conditional application for approval on November 23, more than three months after the deal with Vedanta was announced. The application did not recognise the rights of partner ONGC. With ONGC asserting its rights as well as seeking resolution to the royalty it pays on behalf of Cairn India, Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy is referring the deal to the Cabinet for approval."

In April last year, Reliance agreed to pay USD 1.7 billion to Atlas to form a joint venture and own a 40% stake in Atlas' Marcellus Shale operations in the eastern United States.  In November, Chevron announced plans to buy Atlas for USD 3.2 billion.  Reliance said in the letter that Atlas filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday it would like to evaluate options including whether it could be able to &amp;quot;create incremental value&amp;quot; for Atlas. The Reliance letter said at no time during the seven months of Atlas' discussions with Chevron, Atlas reached out to the Indian company to gauge its interest in a &amp;quot;possible company-level transaction.&amp;quot; The energy major, controlled by Mukesh Ambani,the world's fourth-richest man with a fortune of USD 29 billion according to Forbes magazine, said it had hired Perella Weinberg Partners and Kirkland &amp;amp;amp; Ellis to evaluate its options. &amp;quot;We were very surprised by the announcement of your deal to be acquired by Chevron,&amp;quot; Reliance told Atlas in the letter. Reliance said during its joint venture negotiations with Atlas it was assured that the Indian company would be the &amp;quot;preferred partner&amp;quot; should Atlas choose to pursue a whole-company transaction. A Reliance spokesman in India declined to comment on the development when reached by Reuters on Thursday. The letter also said Chevron's deal valued Atlas' Marcelus assets at a significant discount to the value attributed to them in the joint venture with Reliance. Reliance has been investing in new areas such as shale gas as it seeks a foothold overseas and seeks to expand its businesses beyond petrochemicals, refining, oil and gas exploration, and retail."

It has now broken downwards under that range of almost 18 months. So that is a very significant thing that with such a large time span of consolidation there is a downward breakdown - keeping that in the mind is the back drop for the next month or two perhaps or Rs 200 on Reliance whichever.&amp;quot; He further added, &amp;quot;In the very short run it oversold, it can make a rebound of Rs 20-30-40 that is a side but those rebounds because of this breakdown from this large consolidation will be opportunities to go short on the stock rather than buy and given Reliance is most important stock in terms of its weightage on the index that is also going to keep the whole market topsy-turvy and the picture of next 15-20 days would be at best range trading and selling on rallies.&amp;quot;"

This is based on the agency's expectation that ties between the government and its majority-owned oil companies will not weaken. India's state-owned oil companies dominate the sector, and Fitch links their ratings with that of the sovereign because of the sector's strategic importance and the evidence of tangible financial support. Consequently, these companies' stable outlooks reflect that of the sovereign. &amp;quot;Unless crude oil prices rise significantly, the market-linked petrol pricing regime that was implemented in 2010 will continue to operate in 2011. However, the agency does not expect diesel price reform in 2011 as the fuel has a higher impact on reported inflation, which is one of the government's key economic concerns,&amp;quot; says Abhinav Goel, Senior Director in Fitch's corporates team.  The government marginally increased the prices of cooking fuels -- liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, domestic use) and kerosene (public distribution system) in 2010. However, these continue to be subsidised, and Fitch believes that these will remain at levels set by policy requirements, rather than at market prices even in 2011. Consequently, under-recoveries -- which result when tariffs are insufficient to cover costs -- will remain high for these fuels. &amp;quot;The revision in the Outlook for the downstream public sector to Stable from Negative in June 2010 was based on Fitch's expectation that the government will continue to maintain the oil sector reforms introduced in 2010, and support these companies given their role as the government's extended arm for policy implementation,&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;Goel added. Fitch notes that India's surplus in refining capacity will continue with the commissioning of new facilities in 2011 and beyond. However, public sector refiners are partially protected by price controls. Private sector company, Reliance Industries (Reliance, 'BBB'/Stable), has significant export revenues, benefiting from more complex refineries than most international competitors."

Srivastva said 22 wells will be operational in the gas block by April, up from the current 18, raising the output capacity to 60 mmscmd when the 2011/12 financial year begins. It could likely touch 80 mmscmd by 2012/13, he added. The upstream regulator is believed to have asked Reliance, which began pumping gas from the D6 block in April 2009, to step up its output, as part of the estimated field development plan. Reliance is expected to pump natural gas at full capacity from its deep-sea field during the year to March 2013, after a delay of almost two years. "
