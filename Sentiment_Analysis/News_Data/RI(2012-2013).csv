Based on Aker's report, ONGC will decide whether to enter into an agreement with RIL or not and modalities if it decides to go with the Mukesh Ambani-led company, according to Ashok Varma, Executive Director (Asset Manager) Eastern Offshore Asset. &amp;quot;The agreement with RIL is valid for nine months. Aker is expected to give their report by April. After that we need to do the engineering of the entire thing we put up and float tenders,&amp;quot; Varma told PTI. &amp;quot;Within nine months we have to finish studies. We are on schedule.

The MoU aims at working out the modalities for sharing of infrastructure, identifying additional requirements as well as firming up the commercial terms. This shall not only minimise ONGC's initial Capex but also expedite its field development resulting in early monetisation of its deep water fields adjacent to the fields of RIL, ONGC had earlier said. Aker Solutions provides oilfield products, systems and services for customers in the oil and gas industry worldwide. &amp;quot;If everything is well then we will start working with them from 2017,&amp;quot; Varma added. ONGC has made nine gas discoveries in its KG block KG-DWN-98/2, which sits next to RIL's flagging KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. The state-owned firm plans to club these finds with discoveries in another neighbouring block to begin gas production from 2016-17, ONGC had earlier said."

At current rate of production of about 8 million standard cubic meters per day, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 will produce about 0.3 Tcf in the next three years - the time that may be needed to settle the issue of gas hoarding charges.The bank guarantee for 0.3 Tcf comes to USD 1.2 billion, they said. Of this, the share of RIL, which holds 60 per cent stake in KG-D6, will come to USD 60 million per quarter. BP has 30 per cent interest and the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko.D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the first of the 19 discoveries in eastern offshore KG-D6 block that was put on production in April 2009, originally was estimated to hold 10.03 Tcf of reserves. But these were last year slashed to 2.9 Tcf based on production data for first three years when wells were shut one after another following water and sand sweeping inside along with sharp drop in reservoir pressure.Of the re-stated reserves of 2.9 Tcf, about 2.2 Tcf have already been produced in first four-and-half-years and balance of about 0.75 Tcf remains to be produced.Sources said the new rate will apply to all other fields in KG-D6 without any preconditions. The currently producing MA oil and gas as well as fields like R-Series and satellite discoveries that will come into production in 2016-17 will also get the new rates without any preconditions.The government, sources said, has already imposed a penalty of USD 1.78 billion on RIL and its partners for producing less-than-stated production targets during last three years. The bank guarantee is an addition to this.While RIL blames unseen geological complexities for production not matching the pre-stated targets for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the Petroleum Ministry and its technical arm DGH hold the company for not drilling the committed number of wells, resulting in output fall.With both sides not budging from their positions, the issue has been referred to arbitration which may take anywhere between 2 to 3 years to arrive at final verdict.Prodded by the Finance ministry, the Oil ministry had initially proposed to deny the new gas prices that will kick in from next fiscal till such time that RIL either made up for the shortfall in output during past three fiscals, or it is proved that the company was not responsible for production falling below targets.The issue had held up notification of the new gas pricing formula that will be applicable to all producers - public and private - and all forms of gas - conventional and unconventional forms like coal-bed methane and shale gas.As a way out, it was proposed that RIL and its partners BP and Niko be asked to give bank guarantees for the incremental revenue they will get till the hoarding issue is resolved through arbitration and validation by independent international experts.The government in June approved the Rangarajan formula for pricing of all domestically produced natural gas at an average of global gas hub rates and price at which India imports LNG (gas in liquid form).The rate in April 2014, when the new pricing is to be implemented, will be about USD 8.2 to 8.4 as against the current USD 4.2.Prices of natural gas, which is an input for manufacturing fertiliser and electricity generation, will be revised every quarter based on the average of the past four quarters, with a gap of one quarter."

An intra-court appeal against the order is pending before a larger bench.However, the year was tough for Sahara India Parivar as Roy was not only restrained from leaving India but he and his group firms were accused of taking the apex court &amp;quot;for ride&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;playing hide and seek&amp;quot; in the case relating to refund of Rs 20,000 crore to investors in which they are facing contempt proceedings.More trouble came when the apex court said that contempt proceedings can go ahead against Roy and his two employees for interfering with the investigation into the 2G spectrum case.The 2G spectrum scam also forced&amp;amp;nbsp;Bharti Cellular CMD Sunil Mittal, Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia and&amp;amp;nbsp;Reliance ADAG chief Anil Ambani to rush to the apex court in the wake of special CBI court issuing them summonses to appear as accused and witnesses respectively.While Mittal and Ruia got a temporary relief from the apex court which stayed the proceedings against them in additional spectrum scam in which they have been summoned as an accused, Ambani failed to convince the court to give an order against the trial court directing him to appear as a witness in the 2G case involving former Telecom Minister A Raja and others, including three top executives of his group.A day after ADAG chief's testimony, his wife Tina Ambani also made her appearance in the Patiala house court and recorded her statement which was described as &amp;quot;better than her husband&amp;quot; in answering questions by special judge O P Saini.Government's controversial decision to hike the price of natural gas reached the Supreme Court which agreed to examine the issue raised by CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta who filed a PIL accusing Petroleum Minister M Veerappa Moily of allegedly favouring Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which have been refuted by them.If 2012 was the year of 2G scam, then 2013 would be recorded in the history of the apex court for coalgate case and CBI's clamour to attain autonomy and free itself from its political masters to investigate top bureaucrats.The high voltage hearing in the coal scam saw the apex court taking strong exception to the interference into its probe by the then Law Minister Ashwani Kumar, who was forced to resign.CBI, which was termed as &amp;quot;caged parrot&amp;quot; by the apex court during the hearing in the coal scam, came out all guns blazing and named corporate bigwigs Naveen Jindal and Kumar Mangalam Birla in separate FIRs registered in connection with the case.The controversy surrounding former corporate lobbyist Niira Radia's tapped conversations was dealt by the apex court and after long hearing, it directed CBI to probe some key issues in which names of some big corporates, politicians, bureaucrats and journalists cropped up. Nokia, which, as per the Income Tax department, owes it Rs 21,153 crore as total tax liability (existing and anticipated), including penalty during a seven-year period from 2006-2013, had moved the court with its plea for lifting of stay on sale of the assets.The controversy surrounding the AirAsia deal reached the Delhi High Court after the apex court asked BJP leader Subramanian Swamy to approach the high court.The high court sought responses from Civil Aviation Ministry and DGCA on the plea which has sought a direction against grant of further approvals on the ground that the deal was contrary to the applicable FDI policy and DGCA guidelines.During the year, the functioning of UK-based multinational accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Pvt Ltd and its network audit firms in India came under judicial scrutiny with the apex court agreeing to hear a petition for a probe against them for allegedly indulging in financial irregularities and fudging of accounts.The court issued notice to Centre, RBI, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), PwC and the audit firms sharing its brand name saying the issues raised in the petition need &amp;quot;examination&amp;quot;.In the issue of arbitration proceedings of dispute between Antrix Corporation, the commercial arm of ISRO, and Devas Multimedia regarding scrapping of 1,000 crore deal for scarce S-band spectrum, the apex court held that it can take place at International Court of Arbitration in London.The court had dismissed Antrix's plea which had contended that according to their agreement and tender conditions, the place of arbitration was Bangalore and sought seeking its direction for conducting arbitration proceeding in India."

While the government had in June approved a new formula for pricing of all domestically produced natural gas, the Cabinet yesterday allowed the same principles to also be applied to Reliance Industries' currently producing fields in KG-D6 block subject to certain conditions. &amp;quot;If you don't raise gas price, no domestic production will come and dependence on imports will increase,&amp;quot; Moily said at the AIMA's 3rd PSU Summit here. India, which currently imports half of its gas needs, has the hydrocarbon potential which require lot of money to exploit, he said. &amp;quot;You need to spend a lot of money on technology (to access the hydrocarbon) and research.&amp;quot; Higher gas price will help bring to production over 3 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves that had been declared economically unviable at current rates of USD 4.2. Several gas discoveries of firms like&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) as well as of RIL had been declared unviable by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) as current gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit was inadequate to cover the cost. The Minister said the option before the country was to either keep the finds in the ground and continue importing gas at USD 12-13 or pay much lesser than this price to domestic producers to bring the discoveries to production and cut foreign exchange outgo on imports. &amp;quot;We may end up importing 100 percent (of our needs) if we don't encourage exploration,&amp;quot; Moily said. The reserves in the discoveries not viable at current price equals the remaining resources in the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields in RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 block. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on June 27 approved pricing of domestically produced gas at an average of imported LNG and international benchmarks from April 1 2014. Accordingly, the price in April would be about USD 8.4. While the decision was to apply to all public and private producers of conventional gas and non-conventional fuel like coal-bed methane and shale gas, the decision was not notified as the Finance Ministry felt RIL should not get the benefit because it has in past three years produced less than targets. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs yesterday allowed RIL the new rates provided it gave a bank guarantee to cover its liability if gas-hoarding charges are proved. The bank guarantee, which will be equivalent to the incremental revenue that RIL will get from the new gas price, will be encashed if it is proved that the company hoarded gas or deliberately suppressed production at the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields in KG-D6 block since 2010-11."

However, a distinction has now been made in the gas produced from fields given to ONGC on nomination basis. Any gas that came into production after 2010 is being treated differently than APM gas for which the government decides the price as well as marketing margin. Gas from the fields of ONGC that came into production after 2010 are being termed as non-APM gas and GAIL has been since November billing higher marketing margin of Rs 10.21 per mmBtu on such fuel sold to consumers, sources said. Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers&amp;amp;nbsp;Ltd (RCF) and&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are among the consumers who have got two bills for November quoting the higher marketing margin. While RCF refused to pay the higher charges, RIL paid the first bill in protest but when the second bill came it deducted the higher charges it had paid earlier, they said. Non-APM gas coming from the nomination fields of ONGC is distributed to consumers by GAIL although a small volume is directly sold to consumers by ONGC itself. Also read: Essar Energy reiterates outlook, shares rise While ONGC has not changed the marketing margin on the volumes it trades directly to consumers, GAIL has been since November billing consumers a higher marketing margin. GAIL, sources said, has reasoned that the higher marketing margin is at par with the rate it charges for its effort on sale of gas from western offshore fields of Panna/Mukta and Tapti. At the time of revising APM gas price to USD 4.2 per mmBtu in May 2010 (effective from June 1, 2010), the Oil Ministry had directed that marketing margin of Rs 200 per thousand cubic metres would be charged from customers by the company marketing the gas produced by national oil companies (ONGC and Oil India Ltd). Subsequently, in June 2010, the Ministry again clarified that marketing margin shall be charged by ONGC and OIL in cases where they are directly selling gas to end customers and in other cases, the marketing margin would be charged by the companies marketing the gas ie GAIL. The Ministry had last month ordered that allows marketers freedom to fix marketing margin on sale of gas to consumers other than urea manufacturing units and LPG plants. Oil regulator PNGRB will decide marketing margin for urea and LPG plants."

Stating that all timelines prescribed in the PSC were followed, he said RIL submitted the proposal to declare the finds commercial within the stipulated three years and a FDP for the five finds along with four others on July 14, 2008, within the prescribed one year. RIL said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) communicated that the discoveries are unviable at the current price of USD 4.2 only on March 31, 2009, as against the PSC stipulated timeline of deciding the issue within 180 days from the submission and 90 days from receipt of additional information. &amp;quot;The DGH evaluation using a gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units ignored the fact that the gas price of USD 4.2 was valid only until March 31, 2014, and that the competitive arm's length or market price for gas might increase,&amp;quot; Ganguly said. Following the DGH advice, RIL submitted an optimised field development plan on December 19, 2009, for the big four out of the nine discoveries and left the rest for being tied up at a later date. RIL said the original FDP of July 2008 for the five finds was still valid and had not been withdrawn and the DGH assertion that no development plan was submitted for D-4, D-7, D-8, D-16 and D-23 was not true. The &amp;quot;order for relinquishment of area relating to these discoveries is inconsistent with the provisions contained in the PSC and is in breach of the contractor's right under the PSC,&amp;quot; Ganguly added. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

The Ministry, which has been for past two years grappling with the issue of marketing margin charged by gas producers and sellers like Reliance Industries and GAIL India, last month ordered that the margin to be charged over and above the gas sale price be fixed between seller and buyers in sectors other than urea and LPG.  Official sources said the Ministry on November 21 asked the oil regulator PNGRB to determine the marketing margin for supply of domestic gas to urea and LPG producers through its independent process. The rates determined by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) would thereafter be notified by the government, they said.  Also Read: RIL-BP JV can quadruple natural gas production by 2020 In other cases, the Ministry ruled that the marketing margin should be determined by the buyer and seller and any complaints about exercise of monopoly power should be addressed to PNGRB and/or the Competition Commission of India.  Presently, marketing margins charged by producers and sellers of gas are in the range of 11 cents to 20 cents per million British thermal unit (mmBtu). Fertiliser plants had opposed RIL charging 13.5 cents per mmBtu as marketing margin over and above the government fixed price of USD 4.205 for KG-D6 gas.  The Oil Ministry on December 26, 2011, asked PNGRB to determine the quantum of marketing margin chargeable on sale of natural gas to end consumers by a marketing entity. The Board on February 14, 2012 issued notices to companies like RIL and GAIL seeking information on cost of production or import or acquisition of natural gas, the selling price of the fuel to end consumers and itemised detailed break-up of the difference between the two.  However, later in the year, it refused to fix the marketing margin saying it cannot decide on the issue as natural gas as a product has not been formally notified by the government for adjudication by the Board, sources said. On a second reference, the PNGRB advised the government to stipulate a uniform marketing margin for all sellers of domestic gas, while giving free hand to sellers of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and firms selling CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.  This was strongly opposed by RIL, which said the stipulation was discriminatory. RIL, whose 13.5 cents per million British thermal unit as marketing margin on KG-D6 gas is higher than 11 cents charged on gas produced by ONGC/OIL but lower than 20 cents that GAIL charges for western offshore gas and imported LNG, said there was no legal basis to regulate the levy.

KG-D6 has seen output drop from almost 70 mmscmd achieved in March 2010 to under 12 mmscmd currently due to water and sand ingress in wells and drop in reservoir pressure. 10 out of the 18 wells on the main D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields have shutdown due to the same reason. RIL-BP, he said, is doing remedial work on three shut wells which will yield results in January-March quarter. "

The bank guarantee, which will be equivalent to the incremental revenue that RIL will get from the new gas price, will be encashed if it is proved that the company hoarded gas or deliberately suppressed production at the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block. &amp;quot;Both the Planning Commission and the Law Ministry are agreeable to the proposal set out in a draft cabinet note sent to them for comments,&amp;quot; an Oil Ministry official said here. The bank guarantee will cover the difference between the current gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units and the rate of USD 8.2-8.4 per million Btu, which will come into effect from April 1. Also read: RIL's KG-D6 output slips to 10 mmscmd  &amp;quot;We are awaiting Finance Ministry comments before a final note is taken to the Cabinet,&amp;quot; the official said, adding that the new gas price, which will be applicable uniformly to all producers, will be notified thereafter. The Oil Ministry had previously proposed that RIL be forced to sell gas from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields at the current rate until it is proved that the 80 per cent fall in output at the fields was due to natural reasons or it makes up for the shortfall in production since 2010-11. This would have meant pronouncing RIL guilty even before trial, he said. The veracity of allegations that RIL hoarded gas in anticipation of a price hike can be established by arbitration or a third-party expert, a process that can take 1-2 years. &amp;quot;If we forced RIL to sell gas at USD 4.2 and at a later date it was established that output had fallen due to geological reasons and there was no hoarding, then who would make good the difference between USD 4.2 and the price they are actually eligible from April 1, 2014?&amp;quot; The official said the government cannot ask consumers to pay a higher price for gas consumed in the period taken to decide on the hoarding charge. The government, he said, could have charged customers the higher price from April 1 and paid RIL the lower rate while keeping the difference in an escrow account until the issue was sorted out. However, the production sharing contract does not provide for escrow accounts. The bank guarantee will be calculated quarterly as the gas price will change every three months, based on average international hub prices and the rate at which LNG (liquefied natural gas) is imported in India. The bank guarantee will be about USD 90 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014-15, considering an anticipated output of less than 8 million metric standard cubic meters perday (mmscmd) from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, after netting the excess royalty that RIL will pay at the higher price.  The official said it is a win-win situation for both sides. The bank guarantee secures the government's interests and the higher gas price protects the operator's interests. If the hoarding allegations are true, the bank guarantees will be encashed, with interest, for the period from April 1 to the date the charges are proved. From April 1, all domestic gas will be priced at an average of international hub prices and imported LNG costs. Prices will be revised quarterly and will be based on the previous one-year average. RIL will have to furnish a bank guarantee of over USD 90 million, assuming a gas price of USD 8.4 per million Btu in April. A lower gas price would have been the second penalty imposed by the Oil Ministry for RIL falling short of stated production targets. It had already levied a USD 1.8 billion&amp;amp;nbsp; penalty for the output drop, an issue that is in arbitration. Gas production from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields fell to 8.7 mmscmd this month from a peak of 54 mmscmd in March 2010. Production has been below target since the latter half of fiscal 2010-11 and should currently have been 80 mmscmd, as per the 2006 investment plan. Output from the MA oil and gas field in the KG-D6 block, too, has fallen over 62 per cent. However, the ministry and the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, the oil regulator, have agreed with RIL's reasoning that geological complexity was responsible for the drop and approved the higher price for the MA field's output.

The present day production is made up of output from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields as well as MA oil and gas field, he said. In November, it was about 12 mmscmd. RIL blames geological complexities like high water and sand ingress in wells as well as larger than anticipated drop in reservoir pressure for the fall in output from close to 70 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. Also read: Cairn India to invest upto &amp;amp;#36;750mn on KG-Basin over 5yrs  The government however believes that the output fell because the company did not drill the wells as promised when it got a USD 8.8 billion investment plan approved for the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in 2006. It sees the non-drilling of wells as a default in contractual obligation and has slapped a USD 1.797 billion penalty on it. These reasons have led to shutting of 10 out of 18 gas wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields and a third of those on MA. KG-D6 fields, which began gas production in April 2009,&amp;amp;nbsp; had hit a peak of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down of wells after wells. This peak output comprised of 66.35 mmscmd from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries on the KG-D6 block, and 3.07 mmscmd from MA field, the only oil discovery on the block. Besides the fall in output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, gas production from MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, too has dropped.  Asked about the fresh USD 792 billion penalty that the government slapped for producing less than the target in 2012-13, Ganguly said the issue will be part of the arbitration RIL had initited against the previous USD 1.005 billion penalty imposed for output being less than target in 2010-11 and 2011-12. &amp;quot;It is part of the existing arbitration,&amp;quot; he said. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields have in the first fours years of production (2009-10 to 2012-13) produced a total of 1.853 Trillion cubic feet of gas, 1.196 Tcf short of 3.049 Tcf that RIL had committed to produce in the 2006 development plan.  But for the first year, the output has lagged the targets in all subsequent years, which has led to a huge chunk of facilities built lying untilised, according to oil ministry. RIL had built facilities to handle 80&amp;amp;nbsp; mscmd of gas. The company says it did not drill the committed quota of wells as gas reserves are a third of 10.03 Tcf estimated in 2006. It says the production sharing contract does not provide for levy of penalty for producing less than output estimates. "

According to the ministry, while the proposed bank guarantee would secure the government's interests on one hand, the higher pricing would protect the interests of RIL on the other.

Moily met investors, financial institutions and analysts here last night ahead of the forthcoming NELP Round X auctions beginning mid-January. He said unlike the flurry of negative news regarding the issues between the government and RIL, the only major issue is the arbitration settlement, which is pending with the courts now. &amp;quot;We have, over the past few months, cleared as many as USD 7 billion worth investment proposals submitted by RIL,&amp;quot; the minister said, adding that the media was only headlining the negative news. Moily said he expects the Supreme Court to appoint a third arbitrator at the earliest so that the issues between the nation's largest private company and the government could be resolved at the earliest. The ministry had recently asked RIL to provide a bank guarantee of USD 135 million every quarter to get a higher price for natural gas from April 1. The guarantee will be encashed if it is proved that RIL hoarded gas or deliberately suppressed production at the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) -- main gas fields in its Eastern offshore KG-D6 block. It will cover the difference between the current gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units and the proposed new rate of USD 8.4 per million Btu. The ministry had earlier proposed that RIL should be forced to sell gas from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields at the current rate until it is proved that the 80 per cent fall in output was due to natural reasons or it makes up for the shortfall in production since 2010-11. The penalty in the form of the lower gas price would have been the second imposed by the ministry on RIL for falling short of the stated production targets.

Production has been lower than the target since the latter half of the 2010-11 fiscal and it should currently have been 80 mmscmd, as per the 2006 investment plan. Output from the MA oil and gas field in the KG-D6 block too has fallen by over 62 percent. However, the ministry and the oil regulator-rectorate General of Hydrocarbons - have agreed with RIL's reasoning of geological complexity being responsible for the drop and has approved the higher price for the MA field's output."

The committee also note that the action taken by the ministry in respect of cost disallowance of USD 1.005 billion to contractor based on the arbitration procedure, it said. &amp;quot;In view of the above the committee is of the opinion that non-adherence by the contractor to approved field development plan should be construed as 'default' and not just failure and remedial action by the Ministry in this regard must be premised on 'default' by the contractor not on 'failure',&amp;quot; the committee said. Somabhai Gandalal Koli Patel, Lok Sabha member from Surendranagar constituency of Gujarat, was the acting chairman of the standing committee. Congress MP Vundavalli Arun Kumar, who was chairman of the committee when it was formed, said the recommendations were submitted to the Speaker's office and the Government will have to give the action taken report on the recommendations. The committee observed that the KG D-6 is one of the successful discoveries in the NELP regime which gave hope to the country in its quest for exploration of hydrocarbon resources. According to the committee report, the planned production as per the approved field development plan was 33.83 mmscmd in 2009-10 and to go up to 86.73 mmscmd in 2012-13. However, the production for the KG D-6 basin started declining as the actual production 55.89 in 2010-11 to 26.18 mmscmd in 2012-13. The committee said the contractor has not adhered to the measures suggested by the regulator DGH to drill wells to increase natural gas production. &amp;quot;Also coincidently the demand of the increase in the price of natural gas by the contractor over and above the discovered price by arm length mechanism as provided in the PSC has also brought question mark regarding the interest of contractor to abide in the sanctity and stability of the PSC,&amp;quot; it said. The committee also observed that the study conducted by the expert appointed by the DGH on the decline concluded that the reserves as estimated earlier which are around 10 TCF (Trillion Cubic Feet) are still available and remedial measures will help the production to go up. The cost disallowance of USD 1.005 billion imposed up on RIL was taken for arbitration by the company."

The company is mobilising a drilling rig for the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields &amp;quot;to commence a three-well workover programme that is expected to increase the volumes from this field in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year (ending March 31, 2013),&amp;quot; said Niko Resources, a minority partner in the KG-D6 block. Workover is the process of performing major maintenance or remedial treatment on an oil or gas well. Niko, which holds a 10 percent interest in the KG-D6 block, said in its second-quarter earnings statement that the workovers will &amp;quot;contribute&amp;quot; to an increase in gas production. BP Plc of UK holds the remaining 30 percent in KG-D6. RIL, the operator of the block with a 60 percent stake, produced 12.26 mmscmd from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields and the MA oil and gas field in the block in the Bay of Bengal in the week ended October 27, according to a status report of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). RIL had also shut two of the six wells at the MA field due to high water and sand ingress. The DGH report said the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields produced 9.39 mmscmd of gas, while the remainder came from the MA field. The KG-D6 fields, which began gas production in April 2009, hit a peak output of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down well after well. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, produced 66.35 mmscmd, while 3.07 mmscmd was the output from the MA field, the only oil discovery on the block. Besides the fall in output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, gas production from the MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, has dropped. Niko said a development well, MA-8, has been spud at the MA field. &amp;quot;The well is expected to be on-stream in December.&amp;quot; The well and the workovers will help reverse the drop in output at KG-D6. Sources said the workovers had been stuck for almost two years as the Oil Ministry and the DGH refused to approve their budgets. They were cleared only after Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily intervened. The DGH report said 12 mmscmd of the last reported output at KG-D6 was sold to urea manufacturing plants and no sale was made to power plants. The remaining production was consumed by the pipeline that transports the KG-D6 gas, it said."

However, the glitch in the plan was how the government would make up for the difference between the current rate of USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit and the new rate of almost USD 8.4 that is to become applicable for all domestic gas from April 1 next year, if at a later date it is proved that the fall in output was actually due to geological reasons and RIL was not hoarding gas. Sources said the veracity of charge that RIL was hoarding gas in anticipation of higher price, can be provided either by taking legal recourse (arbitration) or by appointing a third party expert. These processes could take at least a year. The government, they said, could have charged the higher price applicable from April 1 from consumers but paid RIL lower rates and keeping the difference in an escrow account till the hoarding issue is sorted out. However, the production sharing contract (PSC) does not provide for such escrow accounts. Alternatively, the government can allow RIL the increased price provided the company gives a bank guarantee for the incremental amount, which can be encashed if the hoarding charges were later proved to be true. The second option would be a win-win for both sides and would also not impact investor sentiments, sources said adding that the Oil ministry has moved Cabinet with this option in a revised note. The penalty in form of lower gas price is the second penalty that the Ministry is seeking to impose on RIL for failing to produce as per stated production targets. It has already levied USD 1.8 billion penalty for the same reason andthe issue is before arbitration. Gas output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields has fallen to 10 million standard cubic metres per day from the 54 mmscmd peak achieved in March 2010. Production has been lower than target since the latter half of 2010-11 fiscal and it should currently have been 80 mmscmd as per the 2006 investment plan.

However, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) wanted another 1,130 sq km of area, which contained these 8 finds, to also be taken away from RIL on the grounds that the timeline to develop the fields had expired. RIL and its partner BP Plc officials on September 18 made a detailed presentation to the Minister, Oil Secretary Vivek Rae and DGH Director General R N Choubey, contending that it had not deviated from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and had the right to retain the 1,130 sq km area. Sources said Moily after examining the issue wrote on the file that, &amp;quot;the contractor should be asked to relinquish corresponding areas pertaining to 5 discoveries (814 sq km) with immediate effect&amp;quot; as RIL had not submitted the field development plan for these within the stipulated timeframe. He wanted this area to be to be offered for bidding on a priority basis. For the balance three finds covering an area of 316 sq km, he agreed with RIL-BP that the DGH had not been insisting on drill stem test (DST) for confirmation of a discovery in the past and had decided to rake up the issue of in absence of DST in case of D29, D30 and D31 finds after 8 months of commerciality documents being submitted and around 40 months from the discovery. &amp;quot;There has been practice in the past not to insist for the DST for declaration of the commerciality (a prerequisite before investment plans are considered) by the DGH and a circular to that effect is still in existence,&amp;quot; Moily wrote. He noted that RIL had submitted declaration of commerciality (DoC) for three finds within time and there was delay on part of the DGH in reviewing them. &amp;quot;Therefore, a fair and balanced approach could be to allow the contractor to conduct DST now and review the DoC on the basis of outcome of these tests,&amp;quot; Moily wrote. Depending on the outcome, the matter may be taken up before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for its information, he added. RIL has 18 oil and gas finds and one oil discovery in the eastern offshore KG-D6. Of these, D26 or MA oil discovery started pumping oil in September 2008 while D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields were put on production in April 2009.

Currently, an operator upon finding oil and gas in a well, has to inform the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), which would recognise it as a discovery only if it gets evidence of physical flow of hydrocarbons on surface. After this, the companies are required to get their commercial viability approved, called Declaration of Commerciality. Once DoC is approved, it submits a FDP for approval and can begin work on bringing the find to production only after the investment plan is approved by MC headed by DGH. "

The increase in net sales was mainly led by higher Refining segment sales (+16.2 percent yoy to Rs 97,456) and Petrochemicals segment sales (+12.8 percent yoy to Rs 24,892cr). RIL's KG-D6 gas production fell to 14mmscmd compared to 29mmscmd in 2QFY2013.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;RIL's EBITDA, however, remained flat yoy at Rs 7,849cr, on account of lower profits from the Refining and Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segments.

KGD6 production at 14mmscmd vs. 15mmscmd QoQ continued its declining trend With expected improvement in RIL's business profile in the next 2 years, limited downsides, potential upsides from positive developments in E&amp;amp;amp;P and attractive valuations. Reliance Industries Ltd.'s (RIL) GRMs were in line with our and street expectations. Sequentially, GRMs decreased from USD8.4/bbl to USD7.7/bbl on the back of a decline in product spreads of light/mid-distillates, especially gasoline and FO. This, in turn, caused a dip in EBIT margins by 30bps on a QoQ basis to 3.3 percent to Rs31.7bn. RIL GRM was further dented by a weak light and heavy crude oil spread, which declined by USUSD0.3bbl to USUSD3.7/bbl Benchmark Singapore refining margins also dipped in Q2FY14, averaging USUSD5.4 as against USUSD7/bbl QoQ. This decline was the result of a steep fall in&amp;amp;nbsp; gasoline spreads to USUSD9.7/bbl vs. USUSD11.7/bbl QoQ, and FO spreads to USD-12.3/bbl vs. USD-3.6/bbl QoQ, which forms a higher proportion of the Singapore GRM product slate. Refinery throughput for Q2FY14 stood at 17.7mnt as against 17.1mnt QoQ. RIL's strong performance during the quarter has largely been the result of the weak rupee and better petchem margins. However, it is too early to expect a sustained recovery in petchem margins. In the case of petchem, demand remains a concern. Any weakness in demand could impact a sustained margin recovery. We maintain our weak outlook on the refining cycle for the near term on the back of a higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. The incremental net refining capacity additions are expected to be 1.7mbpd in 2013 as against demand growth of 1mbpd. Gas production from the KG basin is expected to increase in the coming quarters from MA field (D26; part of KGD6). However, incremental production from other fields, mainly Rseries, Satellite Field, etc. depends on gas pricing approval. &amp;quot;Although a positive government stance on RIL's E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts in terms of project approvals and gas pricing augurs well for the company, final results on pricing are yet to be declared. We remain cautious about RIL's refining and petchem margins for the near term, due to new capacities and/or weakening demand. However, with the expected improvement in RIL's business profile in the next 2 years, limited downsides, potential upsides from positive developments in E&amp;amp;amp;P and attractive valuations, we maintain an Accumulate rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs982. Currently, the stock trades at FY15E PE multiple of 11x and 1.5x P/BV,&amp;quot; says Emkay Global Financial Services research.

Also read: DGH shifting goalposts to strip off our discoveries: RILSAT has been hearing the appeal filed by RIL against Sebi in the insider-trading case related to its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) dating back to 2007. The company is also contesting the regulator's decision of last May to keep the case out of the consent mechanism, suggesting the amount involved is too high. Under Sebi's consent mechanism, companies can seek to settle cases with the regulator after paying certain charges and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. Hearing the arguments, which have been adjourned eight times in recent past alone, SAT presiding officer J P Devadhar said: &amp;quot;Without going into the merits of the case, we want to know if Sebi can consider RIL's consent application in the interest of justice.&amp;quot;  In response to this, Sebi senior counsel Darius Khambata said he will inform the tribunal after discussing the suggestion with the regulator. Following this, SAT adjourned the further hearing on the petition to October 29. The case dates back to 2007, when before the merger of the RPL with itself, RIL sold 4.1 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum for Rs 4,023 crore in the futures market to allegedly prevent a price correction and later in the spot market, covering the share sales in the futures market. As per the Sebi findings, the company booked a profit of Rs 513 crore in the futures segment through this deal. RPL was later merged with RIL. Sebi claimed that the company was aware of the sale of shares and sold futures ahead of that, therefore amounting to insider trading. Following this Sebi ordered a probe and found that RIL had violated insider-trading norms. Though it approached Sebi for consent settlement, the regulator did not entertain the application, forcing RIL to move SAT. At the last hearing on September 25, SAT had asked Sebi to produce the file on the alleged RIL insider trading case and the notings of the committee that decided to withdraw the company from the consent mechanism. Under the consent mechanism companies/individuals can seek to settle cases with paying a fine but without admitting to or denying any wrongdoing. In case the allegations are proved, then a company may end up paying up to three times the profit made from the illegal trade practices. Accordingly, in the case of RIL, the company could pay over Rs 1,500 crore, as it has been alleged that it booked Rs 513 crore from insider trading. RIL has challenged the show-cause notice issued by Sebi in December 2010 citing that it was not given adequate access to the documents on which the show-cause was based. RIL has also challenged Sebi for taking the case out of the consent process and also for changing the norms governing this mechanism, especially when the case was already under its consideration. In May 2012, Sebi had tightened the consent mechanism framework. As a result, many cases, including those related to insider trading, are not being settled through this mechanism.  On January 3 this year, Sebi published a list of 149 consent pleas, including 16 from entities related to the RIL Group, which it had not found suitable for consent settlement.  These include applications of RIL itself and that of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani's close aide Manoj Modi. At the last hearing, SAT had rejected an intervention petition filed in the case by a little-known Urdu daily editor M Furquan who claimed that there could be possible collusion between Sebi and RIL to settle the matter.  The matter was last heard by SAT on February 21, when the tribunal sought time to study the application, which Sebi termed as &amp;quot;not maintainable&amp;quot;. Since then RIL has been seeking adjournments. The case has been adjourned every month since March. "

RIL as per contractual requirement of retaining only the area where discoveries have been made, had offered to give up or relinquish 5,367 square kilometers out of the total 7,645 sq km area in the block. But the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) wants another 1,130 sq km of area, which contains the 8 discoveries, to also be taken away from RIL on the grounds that the time line to develop the fields had expired. RIL in a presentation to Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily and his top ministry brass last month, said it had not deviated an inch from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and had the right to retain the 1,130 sq km area. If DGH is to carve out this area and auction it, the new company will not be able to produce from these before 8-10 years, it said. RIL on the other hand plans to integrate the finds, which are small or marginal in nature and &amp;quot;unviable&amp;quot; on standalone basis, with other finds in the block and produce by 2017-18. Of the eight discoveries in 1,130 sq km area, the DGH refused to consider investment plans for five, with 0.805 Tcf of reserves, saying they were not viable at the current price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units. The regulator refused to recognise the other three as discoveries in the absence of prescribed tests to confirm them and then disallowed pleas by Reliance and partner BP Plc for time to do the tests. RIL said the declaration of commerciality (DoC) - a prerequisite before investment plans are considered - for D-29, 30 and 31 was &amp;quot;submitted in February 2010 and DGH raised requirement of DST (Drill Stem Test) after 8 months of DoC submission and around 40 months from discovery well.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;PSC also leaves selection of testing to the contractor's best technical judgment. Contractor conducted Modular Dynamic Test (MDT) and is of the opinion that DST is not required,&amp;quot; it said, adding that to resolve the impasse and to expedite development of resources it has offered to carry out DST as well. For the balance five finds (D4, 7, 8, 16 and 23), it said DGH in March 209 found USD 4.2 price &amp;quot;uneconomical&amp;quot; for their development along with five other discoveries and asked RIL to optimise the field development plan. RIL in December 2009 submitted a optimised field development plan, proposing to develop four finds (D2, 6, 19 and 22) first and balance 5 (D4, 7, 8, 16 and 23) later and disagreed with evaluation of USD 4.2 per mmBtu. It said the development plan was neither denied nor withdrawn and so area of the five discoveries is valid and cannot be taken away."

Also Read: The oil saga: Why Veerappa Moily's troubles have just begun &amp;quot;There are world renowned experts who definitely can go into these things and can come out with the truth. We don't want to prevent any truth from coming out,&amp;quot; he told reporters on the sidelines of a conference organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce. Oil regulator DGH has blamed RIL's failure to drill committed wells for the gas output falling by 80 percent to 10 million standard cubic metres per day from the main D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 fields in KG-D6 block, instead of rising to the planned 80 mmscmd. On the other hand, RIL and its partner BP plc of UK feel that the reserves have dropped one-third to under 3 trillion cubic feet due to previously unknown geological factors and the undrilled quota of 11 wells would not increase production. Moily's ministry has been mulling appointing an international reservoir expert to ascertain facts. &amp;quot;Truth is truth, nobody can prevent it, nobody can manoeuvre it,&amp;quot; he said adding his ministry was &amp;quot;consciously&amp;quot; working towards unravelling the truth. DGH wants USD 1.786 billion penalty to be levied on RIL for its &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot; to produce projected quantity of gas as Oil Ministry in a parallel move wants the company to be denied the benefit of gas price revision upon expiry of current USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit rate in April 2014. &amp;quot;The question is that if gas is available, yes gas is available. There experts who can find out,&amp;quot; Moily said.&amp;amp;nbsp;Speaking at the conference, he said that his ministry will go &amp;quot;strictly according to the rules&amp;quot;.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;The government is not willing to deviate an inch from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC),&amp;quot; he said adding if one field was sick it did not mean the entire country was sick. A KG-D6 block oversight panel headed by DGH had earlier this week refused to take a view on appointing renowned reservoir consultants Ryder Scott, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;amp;amp;M), Gaffney, Cline &amp;amp;amp; Associates (GCA) or Netherland, Sewell &amp;amp;amp; Associates to validate reasons for the fall in gas output. Oil Ministry officials - Aramane Giridhar, Joint Secretary (Exploration); S C Khuntia, Additional Secretary &amp;amp;amp; Financial Advisor and VLVSS Subba Rao, Advisor (Finance) - attending the one-hour long MC meeting did not convey any decision. RIL-BP feel drilling of the remaining 11 wells would require over USD 1.65 billion investment while the currently available reserves can be produced by spending around USD 0.5 billion in repairs and compression of existing wells. The appointment of an independent international expert, which RIL-BP have been pressing for several months now, would establish who is right and who is wrong, sources said. "

Moily's ministry sees production not meeting stated targets are breach of contract and has levied USD 1.786 billion in penalty by way of disallowing cost incurred in past three fiscal. Also, it plans to deny RIL benefit of new price after the current USD 4.2 expires in April next year. &amp;quot;A double penalty to the contractor: On one hand cost recovery being disallowed on the other market price being denied,&amp;quot; RIL said in the presentation. It said under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), output figures in a development plan are only estimates and not commitments. &amp;quot;There is no provision in the PSC that allows Government to penalise the contractor if production shortfall is caused by geological complexities,&amp;quot; it said adding the contract allows RIL to recover all its costs. On move to disallow new USD 8.4 per million British thermal unit price for gas from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, RIL said, &amp;quot;there appears to be significant contradiction to the government's positions with regards to PSUs who have been granted a nearly 2.5 times price increase despite shortfall in production.&amp;quot;  RIL said geological surprise has led to decline in production and subsequent downgrading of reserves. Stating that it had on numerous occasions requested to appoint an independent international expert to verify its claims, the company said, &amp;quot;Reluctance to appoint a third party exert despite repeated requests and delay in approval of revised field development plan has led to a negative propaganda perpetrated by detractors.&amp;quot; . The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons had in July recommended to the Oil Ministry that USD 781 million of the cost RIL has incurred in KG-D6 fields be disallowed for producing only an average of 26.07 million cubic meters per day of gas as against the target of 86.73 mmcmd in 2012-13. This will be in addition to USD 1.005 billion in cost recovery already disallowed for output falling short of targets during 2010-11 and 2011-12. Parallely, the Ministry is moving Cabinet to deny RIL a higher price of gas produced from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields till the dispute over the reasons for output not matching targets is resolved. It wants the current rate of USD 4.2 to continue to apply for gas produced from Dhirubhai-1 (D1) and D3 fields even after expiry of the current term on March 31, 2014. The government had in late June approved pricing of all domestically produced natural gas at an average of international hub rates and actual cost of LNG into India from next fiscal. The new rate, according to this formula, would be around USD 8.4 per mmBtu. The new rates were to apply uniformly to gas from RIL fields as well as those of state-owned ONGC. Now, the Ministry wants the old rates to continue for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields but the new price would apply to all other fields in the KG-D6 block including the currently producing MA oil and gas fields."

But finance ministry had some constraints... so we bifurcated that allowing national oil companies first,&amp;quot; Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily said on the sidelines of the HSE Conference organised by Cairn India here. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Tuesday approved the long-awaited shale gas and oil exploration programme to boost domestic output.In the first phase, state-owned ONGC and OIL have been permitted to explore for and produce shale oil and gas from onland blocks that were allotted on a nomination basis before advent of the New Exploration Licensing Policy in 1999. The government will offer shale oil and gas blocks to other companies through an auction planned after such a policy is taken to the Cabinet for approval in the next few weeks.  The policy for allowing private firms to also explore and produce shale oil and gas &amp;quot;will come very soon,&amp;quot; he said. Shale gas, or natural gas trapped in sedimentary rocks (shale formations) below the earth's surface, is the new focus area in the US, Canada and China as an alternative to conventional oil and gas for meeting growing energy needs. As per available data, six basins -- Cambay (in Gujarat), Assam-Arakan (in the North-East), Gondawana (in central India), KG onshore (in Andhra Pradesh), Cauvery onshore and Indo-Gangetic basins, hold shale gas potential.  Various studies have estimated recoverable reserves of shale gas at between 6 trillion cubic feet and 63 trillion cubic feet. Shale production will be taxed at par with conventional fields. &amp;quot;Initially, I was in favour of an integrated shale gas policy but due to certain issues we decided to take the first step (of allowing state-owned firms to explore),&amp;quot; Moily said."

Reliance Executive Director P.M.S. Prasad on August 24 wrote a strongly worded letter to Oil Secretary Vivek Rae, questioning the intent of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) in asking the company to give up 6,601 sq km out of the total 7,645 sq km area in the block on the grounds that the time line to develop the fields had expired.  Of the eight discoveries in the area, the DGH refused to consider investment plans for five, with 0.8 trillion cubic feet of reserves, saying they were not viable at the current price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units.  Also read: OilMin seeks legal opinion on levying &amp;amp;#36;781mn penalty on RIL The regulator refused to recognise the other three as discoveries in the absence of prescribed tests to confirm them and then disallowed pleas by Reliance and partner BP Plc for time to do the tests.  &ldquo;In spite of the PSC providing for sale of gas at market prices, and the approved price of USD 4.2 being only valid until March 31, 2014, DGH insisted on evaluating the proposed development plan (of five discoveries) at a gas price of USD 4.2 and declared them to be unviable,&rdquo; Mr. Prasad said, adding this was done even after the knowledge that the field would start production much later than April 2014.  Mr. Prasad said Reliance-BP had agreed to carry out the DGH-prescribed drill stem test to confirm the three discoveries but the regulator never approved them and was now insisting on relinquishment of the areas.  In the 11-page letter with point-by-point rebuttals to the DGH claims, a copy of which was marked to Oil Minister M. Veerappa Moily, Mr. Prasad asked Mr. Rae to &ldquo;advise the concerned to rectify the errors and remove the hurdles which are needlessly delaying further progression in these discoveries.&rdquo;  RIL had offered to relinquish 4,233 sq km of &ldquo;low prospectivity area&rdquo; in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in keeping with the contractual requirement to retain only portions needed to produce oil and gas.  The area RIL is seeking to retain contains the 20 oil and gas finds it has made till date.  &ldquo;Needlessly projecting RIL as a defaulter and forcing the contractor to relinquish discovered resources will not only hurt the investor but considerably reduce the chances of many of these discoveries ever being produced,&rdquo; Mr. Prasad said.  &ldquo;Contractor (RIL) is of the view that the action is clearly an afterthought, based on arbitrary decision and tantamount to disputing completely valid discoveries made at the contractor&rsquo;s risk,&rdquo; he wrote.  Mr. Prasad said the discoveries were unilaterally declared unviable by the DGH without a discussion by the block oversight panel or taking its views into consideration.  &ldquo;Under normal course it would be considered bad faith to take a biased unilateral view, which...delayed further progress for development, and then turn around to blame the contractor for expiry of time period,&rdquo; he said.  RIL, he said, had &ldquo;spent enormous amount of time and money on bringing these discoveries to fruition&rdquo; and would &ldquo;suffer immensely if pushed to a situation of forced relinquishment of rightful discoveries.&rdquo;  The area proposed for cessation has at least 1.15 trillion cubic feet of known recoverable gas reserves valued at USD 4.83 billion at current prices.  Of the 20 finds, RIL began crude oil production from MA field in September 2008. It started gas output from MA field and Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3, the largest of the gas discoveries in the block, in April 2009.  The DGH proposed that RIL should retain only an area of 1,044 sq km, which holds the currently producing D1 and D3 gas and MA oil and gas fields, besides a cluster of four satellite fields (D-2, 6, 19 and 22) and another D-34 discovery.  RIL had in its March 13 proposal wanted to retain 3,412 sq km containing all the oil and gas finds made till date.  Contractually, companies are required to relinquish 25 per cent of the area in an oil and gas block at the end of the first phase of exploration that spans three years.  At the end of second phase, 50 per cent of the area is to be given up. By the third phase, only the area needed for development and production of a discovery is allowed to be retained. The second and third phases are of two years duration each.  RIL was awarded the KG-D6 block in 2000. The three-year first phase ended on June 7, 2003, and the third phase ended on June 7, 2007.  Sources said the DGH in 2006 agreed to RIL&rsquo;s proposal to declare the entire area as a discovery, allowing the company to retain it. The decision was ratified by a committee headed by additional secretary in the ministry and by the Oil Minister thereafter.  However, the decision was questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the government auditor, as only 79 per cent of the block area had been covered by 3D seismic survey at the end of the third phase and yet it had been declared a discovery area.  The CAG, in its performance audit in 2011, had asked the ministry to review the determination of the entire KG-D6 contract area as a &lsquo;discovery area&rsquo;  &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Oil Secretary Vivek Rae said the government has already issued a notice to RIL for a USD 1.005 billion penalty for shortfall in production during 2010-11 and 2011-12. The Mukesh Ambani-run firm has initiated arbitration against the levy. &amp;quot;We have already issued a notice for the penalty of USD 1 billion. For 2012-13, we are examining what needs to be done, whether the higher penalty is to be imposed and if so in what manner. We are seeking the advise of the Law Ministry right now,&amp;quot; he told reporters here. Also Read: Govt move to force old gas price for KG-D6 gas illegal: RIL The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons had in July recommended to the Oil Ministry that USD 781 million of the cost RIL has incurred in KG-D6 fields be disallowed for producing only an average of 26.07 million cubic meters per day of gas as against the target of 86.73 mmcmd in 2012-13. This will be in addition to USD 1.005 billion in cost recovery already disallowed for output falling short of targets during 2010-11 and 2011-12. The arbitration has not begun because the two arbitrators appointed by RIL and the government are yet to agree on a neutral presiding judge for the proceedings. CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta has previously alleged that Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily was scuttling the arbitration proceedings but when RIL moved the Supreme Court seeking appointment of the third arbitrator at the earliest, he too moved the Apex Court seeking stay on the arbitration proceedings. Officials said since arbitration proceedings on the previous penalty issue are yet to commence, it was thought prudent to seek opinion of the Law Ministry on levying further penalty.  DGH blames RIL for not drilling its committed quota of wells for the fall in production that has resulted in a large chunk of production facilities lying unused or under-utilised.  RIL has built infrastructure to handle 80 mmscmd of output but is currently producing less than 14 mmscmd.  As per the production sharing contract, RIL and its partners BP Plc and Niko Resources are allowed to deduct all of the capital and operating expenses from sale of gas before sharing profits with the government.  Creation of excess or unutilised infrastructure impacts government's profit share and this is being sought to be corrected by disallowing part of the cost. DGH, the official said, stated that after cost disallowance, RIL would be required to pay USD 114 million in additional profit petroleum to the government for 2012-13 in addition to USD 103 million that was already due. RIL and its partners have so far undertaken USD 5.768 billion investment in developing the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas field in KG-D6 block and another USD 1.74 billion in the MA oilfield in the same area. Another USD 1.774 billion has been spent as production expenses or operating cost. The Ministry had in May 2012 slapped a notice disallowing USD 457 million of cost till 2010-11 and USD 1.005 billion till 2011-12. The average gas production from KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6 block) during the current year should have been 86.92 mmcmd as per the approved field development plans for D1, D3 and MA fields in this block, which are currently on production.  The output has dropped after hitting a peak of about 62 mmcmd in August 2010. The production has fallen as half of the wells of D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and a third of those in MA field have shut due to water loading/sand ingress. Additionally, DGH blames RIL for not drilling all of its committed 31 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3.  RIL on the other hand attributes the fall to substantial variance in reservoir behaviour and character than previously predicted sharp decline in pressure and early water production in some wells."

G-4 gas field lies about 10-km away from RIL's facilities in the offshore.  Aker Solutions is likely to be hired to see the economic and technical feasibility of laying a pipeline to take the gas from G-4 field to RIL's offshore gas gathering and then to its landfall facilities at Gadimoga near Kakinada. ONGC had in July signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with RIL to explore the possibility of sharing Mukesh Ambani-run firm's infrastructural facility in the East Coast. Officials said before hiring Aker, ONGC is referring the issue to CVC as the Norwegian firm is also likely to be a bidder for G-4 field development contracts. Once CVC clears, Aker will be hired. If successful, the same concept will be explored for the nine gas discoveries in ONGC's KG block KG-DWN-98/2, which sits next to RIL's flagging KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. ONGC, they said, wants to develop G-4 together with the finds in the northern part of its KG-DWN-98/2 block by 2017.&amp;amp;nbsp;Instead of putting separate gas processing and transportation facilities, ONGC is looking to hire RIL's under-utilised gas gathering station at KG-D6 fields along with pipelines that take the fuel to onland as also its processing plant at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. RIL has pipeline and other facilities capable of handling gas output of 80 million standard cubic meters per day.  KG-D6 output has dipped to below 14 mmscmd from 69 mmscmd achieved in March 2010 and the company indicated it may never touch 80 mmscmd due to unexpected geological complexities. ONGC aims to cut capital expenditure as also expedite field development by using RIL's infrastructure. The infrastructure sharing would help in early monetisation of its deep water fields adjacent to the fields of RIL, they said.&amp;amp;nbsp; It plans to produce about 6-9 mmscmd of gas from G-4 and D &amp;amp;amp; E fields in KG-DWN-98/2 block in the first phase. ONGC has found 4.85 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in nine gas discoveries it has made in the Krishna-Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/2. The block is targeted for production by 2016-17 and a peak production of 22 mmscmd is envisaged.  Gas from these is proposed to be produced by combining them with a gas discovery in the adjacent block. The Northern Discovery Area (NDA) consists of the Padmawati, Kanakadurga, Annapurna, D/KT, U, A, W and E gas finds in water depths ranging from 594 metres to 1,283 m.

The Ministry, in the note put to Moily, concurred with DGH's reasoning that RIL had overshot the time allotted to it for developing the area and so should be as per contract be asked to relinquish most of the KG-D6 area. The officials said Moily has to decide if leniency has to be shown to RIL since it has made several discoveries in the area and should be allowed to retain those areas for development.

If Moily decides to accept RIL's offer to enable the company to develop all of the 19 oil and gas discoveries made in the block so far, the proposal will have to go to the Cabinet as it would amount to making changes in signed production sharing contract, officials said. DGH Director General R N Choubey had on April 15 written to Oil Secretary Vivek Rae that of the 19 oil and gas discoveries claimed by RIL, three finds have not been established as commercially viable in absence of test data and the company has not submitted any investment plans for another five. According to DGH's own calculations, 6,601 sq km of contract area proposed for cessation has at least 1.15 trillion cubic feet of known recoverable gas reserves valued at USD 4.83 billion at current prices.

In a strongly worded letter, RIL on September 3 wrote to Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily saying the signed Production Sharing Contract (PSC) does not bind a contractor to indicative production numbers. &amp;quot;Neither the PSC nor the field development plan (or investment proposal) even suggest that a shortfall in production can be considered a breach for which penalties can be levied,&amp;quot; RIL Executive Director P M S Prasad wrote. RIL, he said, has on numerous occasions asked Government to appoint an independent and industry renowned third party technical expert to verify performance of the fields and see if the company was hoarding gas to get benefit of higher price. While no expert has been appointed till date, an &amp;quot;illegal&amp;quot; action with no precedent in the country or in the international petroleum industry practice was being purportedly considered, he said. Prasad said any move to penalise it on allegations of hoarding gas made by certain vested interests having little familiarity with techno-commercial operations of oil and gas industry will be against the PSC. The PSC provides for all reserves and production numbers provided in a field plan are only estimates derived on basis of reservoir understanding at a given point of time. So RIL's estimate of 80 million standard cubic meters per day of gas output from KG-D6 for the current year was based on geological understanding in 2006 which is far removed from actual operations where rapid sand and water ingress shut half the wells and brought down output to less than 14 mmscmd. Prasad said it was not for the first time that a field has not performed up to its anticipation and cited examples of ONGC and OIL, who were never questioned for shortfalls. &amp;quot;The action being proposed by its very nature discriminatory. Any move to penalise RIL for failure to produce so called 'committed' quantities of gas is violative of the PSC, unfair and prejudicial to the interests of the contractor besides being in breach of the contract,&amp;quot; he said. Prasad said such a move would &amp;quot;shatter investor confidence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;stifle further private investments in exploration&amp;quot; as companies will see it as government reneging its commitment in a signed contract."

Last year, apart from being a top performer among Indian energy stocks, RIL also outperformed regional/global peers as well as the Indian market. &amp;quot;Moreover, RIL is a key beneficiary of the weakening Rupee-US dollar exchange rates, as its revenues for all businesses except retail are in USD and we estimate about 50 per cent of the benefit of higher revenues fall to the PBT level after adjusting for higher interest payments on its USD debt,&amp;quot; it said. Every one rupee depreciation in rupee against US dollar would lead to 2 per cent improvement in RIL's FY14-17 net profit.

Goldman said the regulatory environment for RIL has also started turning positive, particularly in the E&amp;amp;amp;P business where RIL has seen a series of approvals for its capex plans in recent quarters. In addition, the government has announced an increase in natural gas prices based on an oil and international gas-linked formula that could potentially double gas prices in FY'15. Also, the recent increase in custom duties for polymers is an indication that the government's intention is of helping domestic producers. &amp;quot;Despite having the highest capex amongst its Asia peers, RIL continues to have a strong balance sheet,&amp;quot; it added.  On the recent turnaround in the E&amp;amp;amp;P business, Goldman said RIL and its partner BP plc made the first success in the KG basin block D6 in May 2013, when they encountered 155 metres of gas condensate column in a new reservoir. &amp;quot;This discovery looks significant given that the largest D6 discovery had a gross hydrocarbon column of 194 mts (MA-2 well). Moreover, if this discovery leads to a new commercial reservoir, it could meaningfully add to D6 reserves,&amp;quot; it said.

On the 4G telecom venture, RIL, it said, seems to have acted prudently so far by avoiding any major cash burn in this non-core venture by getting into infrastructure tie-ups with existing telecom players rather than embarking on full-fledged telecom infrastructure building or buying assets/companies. &amp;quot;RIL has also indicated that it is only looking at overseas opportunities related to its core businesses with strategic importance and synergies rather than in new/unrelated ventures,&amp;quot; it added.  &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Last year, RIL had also signed a new agreement to buy more crude oil from Venezuela. It had in 2008 signed a deal to buy 150,000 bpd of oil, which was gradually raised to 270,000 bpd. Under the new 15-year agreement, the South American country would sell between 300,000 and 400,000 bpd. RIL operates twin refineries at Jamnagar with a total refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. Half of its crude diet can be heavy oil. Prasad said RIL was looking at opportunities to invest in Mexico, Iraq, Canada and Myanmar. RIL was in 2009 supposed to bid with the Indian consortium of ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian Oil Corp and Oil India Ltd for one of the three giant oil blocks Venezuela was offering through auction. It, however, walked out of the consortium possibly due to delays in bidding.  After RIL's exit, OVL-IOC-OIL teamed up with Repsol YPF SA, Spain's biggest oil company, and Malaysia's Petronas to make a successful bid for the massive Carabobo-1 project in Venezuela's Orinoco heavy oil belt. The field, which had about 50 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, can produce a minimum of 400,000 bpd of oil. "

The block oversight committee, called Management Committee (MC), headed by upstream regulator DGH, approved plans of RIL and its partners BP plc of UK and Niko Resources to produce 13-15 million standard cubic meters per day of gas for 13 years from D-34 discovery in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, sources privy to the development said.

RIL, the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, had on January 30 submitted the Field Development Plan (FDP) for D-34 field to DGH. Sources said DGH after examination trimmed down the recoverable reserves to 1.191 Tcf from 1.413 Tcf estimated by the operator. Also, the peak production of 14.9 mmscmd estimated by RIL was brought down to 12.9 mmscmd by DGH. The Dhirubhai-34 or D-34 gas discovery in the southern part of KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin was notified in May 2007. The find was declared commercially viable by MC in November 2011. RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries and 1 oil find in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields were brought to production in April 2009 while MA oil field began pumping oil in September 2008."

Also Read: CBI closes PE against VK Sibal on KG-D6 gas price issue India, in June, took the unpopular step of raising prices from April after a gap of three years, linking domestic gas prices with global liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmarks, that could hurt the fertiliser and power sectors. The panel, headed by former finance minister Yashwant Sinha said, a cap was necessary to avoid the potential for unlimited gains to local producers due to an upswing in global prices. The recommendations of the panel are similar to those of the finance ministry that were sent to oil ministry. Minister M Veerappa Moily has said gas pricing will not be reviewed. Recommendations of the panel are not binding but usually have a bearing on government policy. Revision in gas pricing is seen as benefiting Reliance Industries , whose existing contracts for gas sales from block D6 on the east coast are expiring on April 1, 2014. Output from the block, which was expected to contribute up to a quarter of the gas supply in the country, has been falling since April 2010, cutting supply of the fuel to the power and other sectors. The committee's report on the 'Economic Impact of Gas Price Revision' also asked the government to ensure Reliance delivers any shortfall of gas it owes to customers at the old price of USD 4.2 per mmBtu. Current gas output from block D6 is about 14 million cubic metres a day (mmscmd), way below the expected 80 mmscmd. BP owns 30 percent of block D6 and Niko Resources has a 10-percent share."

GRM was at US&amp;amp;#36;8.4 bbl versus US&amp;amp;#36;8.5 in the previous quarter. Street had predicted profit to go up by 17-20 percent given the low base last year. Petrochemicals (petchem) earnings reduced due to the lack of improvement in oil and gas sector. As a result, we are slightly bearish on petchem segment. The management is optimistic about the petrochemicals business, where it is expanding capacity as it is investing heavily in the petchem business. RIL&rsquo;s new capacities are expected to start operations slowly and steadily from possibly H2FY14 onwards. However, according to us, its effect would be far sighted. At Ajcon, we believe, unless the petchem segment really starts outperforming from current scale, the positive impact on earnings and stock price performance would be modest. RIL&rsquo;s refining segment was also not performing well and there was not much capacity addition. We believe the Company should have gained slightly better because of the currency gain. At CMP, RIL trades at 12x FY15E EPS of Rs 74.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We recommend: &amp;quot;SELL&amp;quot; for short term with a target of Rs 840&amp;quot; in the immediate term as it has witnessed a strong rally recently and historically RIL&lsquo;s other income showed a steep increase of 33 percent as compared to last year of Rs 2,535 crore, a historic high . Ideally, its earnings should have been bolstered by core business income rather than treasury gains which disappointed us. Structurally, the Company&rsquo;s profitability metrics has been under pressure, led by business slowdown resulting into sharp decline of EBITDA margin from 15.4 percent in FY11 and 10.2 percent in FY12 to 8.5 percent in FY13.

He however advises long term investors to accumulate the stock on every fall.  Reliance Industries today reported a gross refining margin of USD 8.4 per barrel for the April-June quarter as compared to USD 7.6 in same quarter last year.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview Q: What is your call on the stock now? First of all these numbers do they surprise you or do you think they are inline with your estimates? A: The numbers are almost inline with estimates. Their project type as well as the recent gas price hike, coke re-gasification and improvement in the gas volume etc are likely to benefit the company by 2016, all these things are synchronising in 2016-2017.  If you look at from the longer-term perspective you will find that things are going in favour of Reliance Industries, but if you see the interim period from here to maybe till 2015 gross refining margin volatility is something where I am a bit worried. If you look at the Reliance earnings, 50 percent of the earnings comes from the refining business alone. So, considering the long gestation period of the project I would suggest to accumulate this stock whenever it falls. I guess that will be the right time to accumulate for the long-term investors."

The ministry has proposed two options &mdash; equal priority to all core sectors of fertilisers, LPG, power and city gas distribution or according fertiliser and power equal priority. The gas supplies would be redistributed among the&amp;amp;nbsp; sector users &amp;quot;pro-rated based on the signed gas supply agreements&amp;quot;. If available gas is to be redistributed among the four core sectors, it would reduce supplies to fertiliser plants by 9.44 mmscmd and lead to an extra urea import of 4.73 million tonne that would levy an additional subsidy burden&amp;amp;nbsp; of about Rs 5,591 crore per annum. On the other hand, supply to the power sector will increase by 10.07 mmscmd, resulting in additional production of&amp;amp;nbsp; about 16,000 million units of electricity per annum. Sources said the ministry reasoned that the production cost of&amp;amp;nbsp; power projects forced to use re-gasified LNG would go down by Rs 10,900 crore per annum. The ministry's second option giving equal priority to the power sector, as is available to the fertiliser sector, would mean gas supply to urea plants would go down by 9.07 mmscm forcing an import of 4.54 million tonnes of urea at an&amp;amp;nbsp; additional subsidy burden of Rs 5,372 crore per annum.  Gas to power sector would go up by 10.79 mmscmd leading to an extra output of about 17,000 million electricity units&amp;amp;nbsp; per annum, saving in production cost of Rs 11,700 crore per annum."

Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) on July 11 authorised the Mukesh Ambani-led RGPL to lay the pipeline from Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh to Phulpur near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. The pipeline will have a capacity to transport 4.3 million standard cubic metres per day of gas including 0.875 mmscmd capacity which will be available for any third party for open access on non-discriminatory basis. PNGRB in the authorisation order said the pipeline will travel from Shahdol to JaysingNagar to Beohari to Gurh and finally culminate at Phulpur. At Phulpur, the pipeline may be hooked into state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd's main Hazira-Vijaypur-Jagdishpur trunk gas pipeline. Connection with HVJ would enable gas to flow to any consumer. RIL plans to produce 3.5 mmscmd of gas from its Sohagpur (east) and Sohagpur (west) coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh from 2015. &amp;quot;The entity is allowed a maximum period of 36 months from the date of issue of authorisation letter for commissioning of the natural gas pipeline project,&amp;quot; PNGRB said in the July 11 authorisation letter.&amp;quot;Any failure on the part of the entity in complying with the targets prescribed in the time schedule shall lead to consequences&amp;quot; including cancellation of the authorisation, it said. RGPL has furnished a performance bond of Rs 13.02 crore as a guarantee for timely commissioning of the project. This is the first authorisation since Ambani's privately owned Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd (RGTIL) lost its permits for laying four natural gas pipelines, over inordinate delays in construction of the 2,175-km lines. Orders cancelling authorisation issued to RGTIL for laying of four pipelines from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Howrah in West Bengal, Chennai and Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu and Mangalore in Karnataka were issued in October last year. PNGRB in the July 11 authorisation letter said RGPL shall be required to take prior approval from the Board for &amp;quot;creation of any lien or charge or hypothecation on the assets of the natural gas pipeline to secure finances for the project and furnish details of utilisation of funds.&amp;quot; "

RIL had in March-end submitted a USD 3.5 billion Integrated Field Development Plan for producing 10 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the discoveries D-32, D-40, D-9 and D-10 in the Block NEC-OSN-97/2 (NEC-25) by mid-2019.  Also read: FinMin wants RIL to supply outstanding gas at old rate DGH, the nodal technical arm of Oil Ministry, has however refused to bring the development plan to block oversight panel, called the Management Committee, for approval disputing commerciality of D-32 and D-40 in absence of Drill Stem Tests (DSTs) to confirm the finds.  Sources with direct knowledge of the development said the issue has now been referred to the Oil Ministry as at least half a dozen discoveries in the now producing KG-D6 block of RIL and several of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had been declared commercial in past without a DST being done.  RIL and its partner BP plc of UK, they said, have stated that DGH should have insisted on DST being done when discoveries were being appraised some years back and not now when development plan has come up for approval.  They also feel DSTs are not just expensive proposition that will have bearing on government's profit take but also not conclusive tests to confirm production profile.  The sources said that on DGH insistence, RIL, operator of the block, has agreed to do DSTs but now the upstream nodal agency says the exploration phase of the block is over and so even those cannot be permitted.  The Ministry, which has been pushing for speedy development of discoveries to raise domestic output so that imports can be cut, will now decide if DGH is right in insisting on DST now and not at the time of confirmation appraisals done some years back.  DGH had recently rejected Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) of three discoveries in the flagging KG-D6 block on grounds of no separate DST being done.  The sources said DGH also refused to provide sanction for drilling of a well to carry out the requisite DST on finds in NEC-25 required to prove commerciality by claiming that the timeline for drilling such a well is over.  It rejected an RIL attempt to begin pre-development activities on the ground that these discoveries cannot be treated as &amp;quot;commercial&amp;quot; in the absence of sustainable production testing data.  According to RIL, D-32 and D-40 hold an inplace reserve of up to 663 billion cubic feet capable of producing 170 million standard cubic feet per day.  RIL holds 60 per cent interest in the block, while British energy major BP and Canada's Niko Resources hold 30 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.  Sources said RIL has argued that conventional short-term DST provided information on instantaneous well rates and did not provide sustainable well production rates.  It argued that sustainable field production levels could be established through an integrated approach (where seismic- MDT-log data is integrated) without carrying out individual DSTs. This approach has the remarkable ability to correctly forecast the well production rates, the company argued.  International operators like BP have used these techniques as the basis for reserve bookings and investment decisions in the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and other established hydrocarbon basins.  The company further argued that as the NEC block is located in simple sandstone reservoir and is dry in nature, there was no need for DSTs to establish sustainable production levels.  In this light, RIL opined that not carrying out DST should not come in the way of commercial evaluation of a gas discovery and an &amp;quot;integrated approach&amp;quot; was best suited for the block.  RIL has nine gas discoveries in the northern part of the NEC-25 block, and six in the southern area.  RIL and its partners had submitted development plan for the NEC-25 block after the government cleared it for future drilling activities by relaxing &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; conditions put by defence establishment.  The NEC-25 block will be the second major block of RIL to start production after D6 Block in the Krishna-Godavari Basin.  Sources said NEC-25 development plans include the re- entry and completion of certain existing wells and the drilling of new wells, all connected via new flow-lines and other facilities into a new offshore central processing platform. The produced natural gas is expected to be transported onshore via a new pipeline."

Pronouncing Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd (RPIL) guilty of violating the insider trading regulations with regard to its dealings in shares of Indian Petrochemicals Corp Ltd (IPCL) in early 2007, Sebi had said that RPIL made profits of over Rs 3.82 crore through these trades. After taking into account the quantum and nature of the violations, Sebi imposed a penalty of Rs 11 crore on RPIL, which was listed as one of the promoter entities by IPCL itself in its regulatory filings as on March 31, 2006. Sebi had asked the company to pay the penalty within 45 days to the account of &amp;quot;Sebi-Penalties Remittable to Government of India&amp;quot;. Once a subsidiary RIL, IPCL used to be a separately listed entity of the group, but was later merged with RIL and delisted from the stock exchanges. Sebi said in its order that its investigations into charges of insider trading norm violations by RPIL showed that the company was having control over IPCL as &amp;quot;promoter having control over the company with the total shareholding of approximately 46 per cent&amp;quot;. Further, RIL was shown as a 'person(s) acting in concert' with RPIL with regard to the shareholding of IPCL, Sebi said. Sebi said it conducted an investigation in the trading of the shares of IPCL during the period from February 22, 2007 to March 08, 2007. In the same case, Sebi earlier this year passed another order wherein it dropped the charges of violations of insider trading norms in IPCL shares against Manoj Modi and his wife. Modi is known as a close confidante of RIL chief Mukesh Ambani and held some senior positions at group entities in the past. Sebi said that the charges of insider trading violations could not be proved against Modi. Sebi's probe into the matter showed an irregular trading pattern in IPCL shares during the period under review, when two key announcements were made by the company -- one about an interim dividend payment and another regarding the amalgamation of IPCL with RIL. IPCL originally used to be a government-owned entity and was sold to RIL group during a disinvestment exercise. "

The Network18 deal came after RIL decided to exit a large part of its investment in ETV channels, which was to be acquired by TV18 Broadcast for Rs 2,100 crore. In 2008, RIL had invested Rs 2,600 crore in Ushodaya Enterprises, the holding company of the ETV channels through JM Financials.  The new channel aims to tap into the now digitised cable TV ecosystem and the DTH platform to take advantage of the growing opportunities. It will have about 4-5 hrs of fresh programming every day, which will include 2-3 hrs of long programming and 1-2 hrs of narrative non-fiction shows.  Set up in 1997, Reliance Ports &amp;amp;amp; Terminals, which is engaged in storage, handling and evacuation of crude oil and petroleum products, had in 2008 merged nine group companies with itself to consolidate the Reliance Group's logistics, engineering and construction-related services businesses. Of the merged firms, four provide logistics, pipeline and engineering-related services to the parent company Reliance, while the others are investment-holding companies.

The pricing formula will be effective on April 1, 2014 for a period of five years, with the price to be revised quarterly using the approved formula.

This price was also indicated in the Annexure that the Oil Ministry attached to the main Cabinet note on pricing of domestic gas as per a formula suggested by the Rangarajan panel.  On page 88 of the Annexure-1, the Ministry stated that the gas price based on the Petronet LNG Ltd's long-term contracts with RasGas of Qatar would come to USD 8.42 per mmBtu.  CCEA has approved inclusion of only price of only long- term LNG imports into India and has left out spot rates.  Petronet has also contracted long-term LNG from Gorgon project in Australia at higher price than RasGas and its inclusion in the formula from 2015-16 would further push up domestic rates.  &amp;quot;The pricing terms of the Petronet contracts are expected to result in further increases in the gas prices in future quarters, assuming current pricing levels of Japanese Crude Cocktail, US Henry Hub, UK National Balancing Point and Japan LNG imports,&amp;quot; Niko said.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on June 27 approved raising natural gas prices from April 2014 to an average of prevailing rates at international benchmarks and cost of imported LNG into the country. The indicative price in April is likely to be USD 8 per million British thermal unit as against USD 4.2 currently. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd, which accounts for bulk of natural gas produced in the country, will gain an additional Rs 18,100 crore (USD 3.1 billion) annually, BofA Merrill Lynch said in the report. About 65 percent of ONGC-OIL's rise in revenue from gas price hike would go to the government as higher royalty, income tax, dividend and dividend tax. &amp;quot;65 per cent of it (USD 2 billion) would go to the government. Rise in KG D6 gas price of Reliance Industries would also boost government royalty and income tax revenue by USD 200 million,&amp;quot; it said. This &amp;quot;USD 2.2 billion revenue rise from gas price hike would be used to fund rise in subsidy,&amp;quot; it said. The report said Finance Minister P Chidambaram had while announcing the CCEA decision stated that no decision has been taken on the input price of gas to user industries of power and fertiliser. &amp;quot;Although no decision on input price for consumers has been taken, subsidies may be considered for some. The investor concern, therefore, is that subsidies to gas consumers like power producers could imply lower gas price to PSU gas producers - ONGC and OIL,&amp;quot; it said. Stating that some gas consumers are already subsidised by the government, it said, &amp;quot;We believe that even in future the government would bear any rise in subsidy. In our view, the rise in government revenue (USD 2.2 billion assuming gas price goes up to USD 8) from gas price hike would fund any rise in subsidy.&amp;quot; It said if the producers were to bear the subsidy and effectively get a lower gas price then there was no incentive to invest more in exploration and production, which is the main reason for the gas price hike. Gas consumers in North East and fertiliser producers are subsidised even now. This subsidy is borne by the government and it does not mean lower gas price for ONGC/OIL.Consumers in North East pay 60 percent of prevailing gas price while OIL, the main gas producer in the region, collects balance 40 per cent of the gas price from the government. &amp;quot;The proposed gas price hike is not the first gas price hike.

The celebrations will be short-lived, for the government&rsquo;s decision to double natural gas prices from USD 4.2 per mmBtu to USD 8.4 per mmBtu from April 2014 is neither reform, nor sensible politics, nor good economics. Here's why. First, there was no tearing hurry to announce a decision for 2014 right now, when a government may change, and the entire global energy scenario may be different. Not only has the UPA tied down the next government to a seriously flawed decision, but its motives in doing so are also suspect. Second, there is no reason why pricing should be announced in dollars &ndash; when the rupee is 60 to the dollar. Remember the criticism of the Enron deal? Why price power in dollars when the revenues are all in rupee? The same logic should apply to the Indian gas pricing scene. Why should the Indian consumer, and possibly the taxpayer, take on the exchange risk of India-produced gas? Third, this is simply not reform. How can a committee- or bureaucrat-decided price be called reform? Do bureaucrats know better than the market? If the logic for allowing a price increase is that import prices are higher currently, one wonders what would happen if global prices crash? The only move that can be called reform is market-based pricing &ndash; where businesses take both the risks and rewards of global and domestic price movements. Fourth, the move is clearly anti-reform, if one goes by Finance Minister P Chidambaram's statement yesterday. He said that the government had fixed output prices and not input prices &ndash; meaning it has decided how much money gas producers, ONGC and Reliance among them, will make, but not how much gas users (power, fertiliser consumers) should pay. This is utter stupidity. Chidambaram said: &amp;quot;At the moment we are fixing only output prices, the price payable to gas producers. This will indeed have an impact on the consumer, but those prices are not being fixed today&hellip;..What is the price at which it should be supplied to a power plant, to a fertiliser plant, in order to make power affordable, fertiliser affordable&hellip; that can still be decided between now and April 1 (2014).&amp;quot; This begs the question: if input prices for power and fertiliser can be decided later, why rush to decide output prices nearly a year in advance? When the two are inter-linked, it's like trying to have your cake today, and leaving the job of cleaning up the mess to someone else in 2014. Fifth, any fixing of input at a lower price than output price will mean a bloating of subsidies. Who will pay this? The taxpayer, or somebody else? In the case of oil subsidies, both taxpayers and public sector oil companies have carried the can for the government's political decisions. Will the same happen with gas now? Will ONGC and GAIL bear the subsidies? This would be a disaster, and a clear case of misgovernance. ONGC shareholders should be suing the government if that happens. Sixth, the UPA's intentions appear suspect and mala fide. If the benefits of a gas price hike are to be had upfront (which is what the markets are celebrating) and the costs will be shifted to the next government (which will have to take the painful decision of bearing more subsidies, or reducing the gas price at the output end), this is clearly a scorched-earth policy. The UPA has essentially lobbed a ticking time-bomb to the next government. Seventh, and this could be the government's real motive, it appears that the gas price announcement was intended to achieve two non-reform goals of the UPA: given the drastic fall in the rupee, the government needed the market to perk up in order to reverse capital outflows; it also needs a buoyant stock market to meet its fiscal deficit target. These targets can be met only if public sector shares can be sold to investors. In June, foreign institutional investors sold equity and debt to the tune of over Rs 40,000 crore. The gas price announcement temporarily reversed that trend yesterday. But reform cannot be about meeting these kinds of goals. Or pandering to FIIs. Eighth, even if gas pricing is intended to induce new investments in petrocarbon exploration, it cannot be done in isolation. The energy sector comprises oil, gas, coal, coal-bed methane and shale gas, too. If you want to reform the sector, you have to reform pricing in all of them, not just gas. By raising gas prices, and leaving other prices and sectors as they are, the government is clearly worsening its energy sector problems. The only way to reform is to let prices of fuels find their own levels, so that businesses can make a rational decision on which fuel to use for what kind of output. Ninth, the doubling of gas prices is widely seen as a favour to gas producers. It may well be that, but in the long-term, it will actually damage the gas sector. When you double prices by fiat, the chances are that gas users will go into losses; they will have to be rescued either by the taxpayer or banks. And future demand for gas-based fertiliser and power plants will be curbed. Who will the gas producers sell to then? In the US, when the government decided to boost shale gas production, it did not set any price. The market did that. This brought in new investment, and competition &ndash; and today natural gas prices at the US's Henry Hub are below USD 4 per mmBtu. And here we are, trying to double that price and calling it reform. The goal of any policy should be efficiency and competition, not guaranteed profits or losses to any stakeholder. As TN Ninan askes in his weekly column in Business Standard: &amp;quot;Is any more proof needed that India's reforms, so-called, are business-friendly rather than market-friendly?&amp;quot; It is difficult to believe that the UPA's gas price move was at all intended to reform anything beyond putting out the fire in the economy's backyard &ndash; where the rupee was clearly going down in flames. Real reform is what the US did with shale gas. Sorry, Mr Chidambaram, we can't buy this.

Read This: Gas price hike to boost Reliance earnings from FY17: Kotak The Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Thursday night approved the Rangarajan panel's proposal to hike the natural gas price to USD 8.4 per mmbtu (metric million British thermal units) from April 1, 2014.  The committee has further noted that Rangarajan panel's formula for gas pricing would be valid for five years and gas prices will be revised quarterly. The oil ministry in its final proposal had suggested to increase gas price to above USD 6.7 per mmBtu level from current USD 4.2 currently. The natural gas prices have not been increased since past three years as the oil ministry faced stiff resistance from power and fertiliser ministry. Following gas price hike fuel cost of gas based power plant is likely to double and average power cost is seen rising by 16 paise per kwh.  The Rangarajan formula uses long-term and spot liquid gas (LNG) import contracts as well as international trading benchmarks to arrive at a competitive price for India. While the Rangarajan panel had recommended revising domestic gas prices every month based, the Oil Ministry changed it to a quarterly revision.  Though the average of the two currently comes to USD 6.775, the price of gas in April next year when these guidelines will come into effect would be around USD 8.42 and over USD 10 in the following year. This is because Petronet's deal with Qatar's RasGas (India's only functional long-term LNG contract) has a price-cap which lifts in January 2014, linking gas prices fully with crude. &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;"

In a note to clients,&amp;amp;nbsp;brokerage house CLSA&amp;amp;nbsp;has analysed the likely impact of the move on the earnings of oil &amp;amp;amp; gas majors.Excerpts from the report: Reliance Industries: This price hike will make the FY15 EPS growth of 19 percent more believable and could take the stock near our target of Rs 930/share, which nearly corresponds to its historical average PE of 11.8 times. More importantly, this gas price hike should make some of Reliance&rsquo;s discoveries commercial and accelerate approvals for developing nearly 4 TCF(trillion cubic feet) of discoveries. q At the same time, this should also incentivise Reliance to carry production improvement programmes in its producing fields in D6. ONGC, OIL: Unlike Reliance, ONGC and Oil India are not neat beneficiaries of this price hike as the government may choose to take back a part of this benefit by increasing subsidy burden of these companies. Nonetheless, even under an oppressive scenario of continuation of FY12/13 subsidyformula of USD56/bbl subsidy on liquid production, we expect ONGC/OIL's fairvalue to settle 6/4% higher than the current market price. GAIL: A price hike to USD 8/mmbtu gas used as feedstock for LPG and petchem production by GAIL lower its EPS by Rs 9.4 (31%) and fair value to Rs 295/share. In our opinion, Gail bears subsidy on LPG production on the logic that it benefits from using controlled price gas as input. Therefore, a sharp hike in gas price makes a strong case for Gail to be exempted from subsidy burden which could boost fair value to Rs 445/sh (+49%) and this could be a blessing in disguise for Gail. Any increase in gas production outlook should be a boost for Gail's core gas transmission business, which has been impacted by four years of decline.

Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman, Feedback Infrastructure expects the government to hike the prices of gas in the range of USD 6.5-8.5/ mmbtu.  Additionally, Chatterjee says once the gas price increases will lead to an increase in the domestic supply. &amp;quot;That is certainly an expectation in the market that there will be an increase in output and availability from domestic sources,&amp;quot; says Chatterjee in an interview to CNBC-TV18. Today&rsquo;s meeting will be eyed by big power players as the earlier proposal was only to hike ONGC and Oil India&rsquo;s administered price mechanism (APM) gas price but was later changed to new gas price regime for all players. The changes will come in effect from April 1, 2014. Below is the edited transcript of Chatterjee&rsquo;s interview to CNBC-TV18.  Q: Put this whole gas price hike business in perspective for us, what it does to the power sector, what it eventually does to the gas availability issue in India and how significant it is or could be from a macro perspective? A: It is a tangled web and I believe the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) along with the empowered group is going to be deliberating and hopefully taking a decision on gas price either today or tomorrow, possibly today.  The spectrum of expectations range from USD 13 per unit as per the presentation made by a group of private sector honchos to the Prime Minister (PM) justifying it on the basis of linkage to petroleum prices, to as low as some people saying that the current price is at USD 4.2/mmbtu is as good as it gets because the long-term well-head prices from Qatar, Malaysia etc are at those prices.  Then, there is a USD 6.6/mmbtu point which has been crystallized around the power ministry and there is an USD 8.4/mmbtu, which has been crystalised around the Rangarajan Committee report. So, my guess is you are probably going to see a decision somewhere between USD 6.5/mmbtu and USD 8.5/mmbtu and both these extremes are within the realm of possibility. The question then is that what happens to availability. The expectation on gas is that any increase in the price now, will hopefully see an increase in domestic supply. That is certainly an expectation in the market that there will be an increase in output and availability from domestic sources. Also, the US Secretary of State, John Kerry&rsquo;s visit to India has taken the discussion forward on US allowing India to import energy, which right now is banned because India is not an free trade agreement (FTA) country, it is not a country that is signatory to the FTA with USA. And USA only approves export of gas including shale gas to FTA approved countries. But we hear that this provision maybe relaxed or may have already been relaxed. This announcement will possibly happen when the Vice President of USA visits us later in the year. We have got the expectation of domestic gas availability rising. We have got expectations of US gas coming in. The real issue is finally that even if this gas is made available at this price to power generating plants, then the question is the end price. The end price of gas produced power could be anywhere from Rs 6.5-7/unit upto Rs 10/unit depending on various issues of costing, logistics, supply etc. In the absence of a peaking power policy and in the absence of any policy that mandates distribution companies (DISCOMs) to buy gas as a source of energy diversification and clean energy, in a situation today where DISCOMs are not even buying thermal power at higher rates because of their fear of increasing their losses and their resorting to load shedding, the big question is that assuming there is a positive answer today from the cabinet on a gas price increase and these other perspectives falling to place, what will happen to gas plants that produced power. The two requirements are some kind of a purchase obligation by the DISCOMs, maybe a huge degree of lifting by the government buying agencies and peaking policy along with an obligation. The other development in the market that is gathering momentum is the fact that many customers who are today buying at tariffs which are set by the regulators have a propensity to pay higher.  States like Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have already given dispensations to say that if there is a willing buyer at a higher price and a willing seller particularly in gas based selling plants in Andhra Pradesh -- the regulator has given a dispensation -- then they allow these two parties to mutually interact and set a price.  If this movement cascades across the country, we have a huge number of customers from malls to factories to institutions which are running their facilities on digisets which probably costs Rs 15 a unit.  _PAGEBREAK_ So, if this facility of &ndash; assuming that the power obligation and peaking power policy, etc take time, even if the government moves ahead allowing willing buyer and a willing seller to negotiate a higher tariff that reduces genset uses, then there is significant hope for gas based power. Q: Are you confident that this decision will come through today, there have been numerous postponements of this meeting, is it your sense that the government is stepping on the panic pedal with respect to policy and they have all these ministry power, fertiliser etc on board with their decision because that is what is of urgent need right now, to move with this fast? A: My information is that there is a reasonable degree of convergence that has happened outside between the ministers, between people who are empowered to take their decisions. I think a political and administrative convergence has already happened so I am reasonably optimistic that today we are going to get the decision.Q: Let me turn the question around from the power side to the gas side, is it your understanding that a price hike to 6.6 going up to 7.5-8 over the next couple of years is good enough for private gas players to start exploration or become far more aggressive in trying to ramp up their gas production? A: I do not think I am qualified to answer that question because the gas production is a combination both of commercial pricing as well as of technical difficulties in extraction. How the two will play out, we will leave it to the players who are operationally involved. This spectrum is so wide that at one level, you have a group of private sector operators including multinational investors in India who can make a strong case to say that gas prices should be linked to international fuel prices. One of the indicators for Asia is the Japanese Crude Cocktail (JCC) and if one takes that, then there is a logical reason to say that USD 13 per unit is a fair price. That is one end of the spectrum. At the other end of the spectrum, if one takes a different point of view which says that linking gas prices to international commodity markets which are manipulated by commodity traders, hedge funds etc is no real medium-term or long-term index of what a price of a natural resource should be.  Hence, the right way to do it is to see what are the long-term contracts from countries that produce gas, from say whom India imports, like Malaysia, Qatar etc. This group will make a point to say that the existing price of USD 4.2 per unit is a fair price so, why even increase that. Then in between there are other arguments.  There is a group that feels USD 4.2 per unit is a decent price based on this bundle of logic, well-head prices of neighbouring countries and there is another group that says the best thing is link it to international petroleum and liquid fuel prices, use JCC and then one gets a price of USD 13 per unit.  So, the theoretical argument is a very interesting one because one can take a position between USD 4 and 13 and in any case there is the Dr Rangarajan Committee in India which officially has submitted its report and says at this point of time, the right price is USD 8.4.  Hence, it is really a tricky issue for the government but with this perspective, the possibility that a political administrative decision that tries to marry different points of view would certainly swing between USD 6.4 and 8.4 per unit. Somewhere in this range, one will get the decision. The issue is skating on thin ice because whatever is done, the government is subject to criticism but at the same time it has to go ahead and give a decision. Q: The expectation also is that once this gas pricing issue is announced, the government is going to follow that up with fairly aggressive price increases both on fuels like petrol and diesel but also prickly issues like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), are you getting that sense that the government is willing to bite the bullet on all these oil pricing issues and increase prices in a dramatic fashion because of what has happened globally as also with the currency? A: The signal that the government is already in a mood to align energy prices in steps to international prices is something that Montek Singh Ahluwalia has been saying for a long time. Whatever we are going to see is a journey where month-by-month or once in two months, there will be a series of incremental increases.  For example, 19 states have increased their tariffs by anywhere from 19 percent to 40 percent, Uttar Pradesh (UP) has just increased by 40 percent. So, even a 40 percent increase in power and in UP it is not just industrial, this 40 percent is to agricultural users and domestic users. So, one is seeing consumers of both domestic power as well as petrol and diesel getting aligned to an economic format which leads them to expect a certain rise few times a year. So, the gradualism or incremental increase to a targeted goal is the way. Indian policymakers will take us down that road."

Also read: RComm, Reliance Jio to ink intra-city fiber pact soon In a country where most people own a mobile phone yet lack basic Internet access, it is a risky gamble even for India's richest man. He is counting on an unproven strategy and still-developing technology in a market with very little pricing power. Three years ago energy conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) won an exclusive nationwide licence to roll out 4G across India, giving it a foothold to tap a potentially lucrative market in phones, tablets, computers and television. The data-focused service could start to roll-out in New Delhi and Mumbai by the end of the year, sources familiar with the matter, who asked not be named, told Reuters. Eventually, the plan is to run it across hundreds of cities. Ambani has refused to divulge any specifics on the launch. In what is one of the world's poorest countries, Ambani's 4G mantra is affordability. This has fuelled industry worries of a price war in a still-crowded telecoms sector that has recently started seeing stability after years of cut-throat competition and regulatory uncertainty. Ambani's strategy is cut-price handsets and data, even if it means he has to subsidise the devices from his own cash pile. Fortunately, he has very deep pockets. Reliance's cash hoard of &amp;amp;#36;15 billion stands in contrast to rival telecoms carriers who are estimated to have a combined debt load of &amp;amp;#36;32 billion. &amp;quot;Broadband and digital services will no longer be a luxury item - a scarce commodity - to be rationed amongst the privileged few,&amp;quot; Ambani, the world's 22nd richest person according to Forbes magazine, told shareholders this month. Ambani hopes to offer 4G devices costing less than Rs 5,000 and in talks with Samsung Electronics Co and others for sourcing handsets and other devices, one of the sources said. A spokeswoman at Samsung's local unit declined to comment. While it appears to be a risky bet, the payoff for a successful venture is first-mover advantage in mobile data communications, which has transformed media, marketing and business strategies from Europe and the United States to China. In a sign that its rollout is gaining pace, Ambani's Reliance Jio Infocomm unit this month signed a USD 2 billion telecom tower sharing deal with mobile carrier Reliance Communications, which is owned by his younger brother Anil. That followed an agreement with rival Bharti Airtel for leasing international bandwidth, and two other pacts. India's cellular market is the world's second largest by users after China, with users surging from just over 5 million in 2002 to nearly 870 million now. However, less than 5 percent of mobile phone owners use their device for high speed 3G data. The uptake for 3G has been slower than expected since its launch in 2011 after costly airwave auctions, mainly due to the premium pricing of data services in a country where voice rates are less than 1 US cent a minute, among the lowest anywhere. Cheap data rates could help grow usage of 4G, which offers several times faster download speeds, but would force Ambani to play an expensive mass volume game - a bruising strategy that has battered margins for India's incumbent mobile carriers. Over the next five years as infrastructure is built, analysts predict India's rapidly growing middle class will buy between 30-80 million 4G connections. Some investors, however, are worried Reliance may be taking too much of a gamble in its bid to diversify away from its oil and gas-related business which produces the bulk of its USD 70 billion in revenues. They are also growing impatient over an outlay that has cost nearly USD 5 billion and counting, with no returns expected anytime soon. Challenges ahead Serious technology challenges await Reliance. The company is using a version of 4G that is still evolving, and there are few compatible network devices and handsets now available. Bharti, which has 4G permits for some service areas, launched its first network more than a year ago, but is yet to start selling a handset that works on the technology. The 2300 megahertz spectrum band India has allotted for 4G is less efficient than the 700 megahertz band widely used in the West. Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad and Samsung's popular Galaxy S4 are not tuned for RIL's spectrum. The 700 band is currently allocated for state TV broadcasting services and security agencies, but the sector watchdog has recommended that the band be auctioned in 2014. Both bands need the same core infrastructure, making the switch from one to the other possible. Ambani's telecoms ambitions have a familiar ring - a decade ago a phone company run by him sharply cut call prices and sold handsets for an initial payment of just USD 10. It transformed an industry that came to symbolise India's rampant economic growth. His re-entry raises the possibility of another price war in a sector where carriers including Bharti and Vodafone have only recently started seeing price stability. &amp;quot;It's a very competitive market, and Reliance looks to be very serious and aggressive,&amp;quot; said Walter Rossini, a Milan-based fund manager at Aletti Gestielle SGR, which counts Reliance and Bharti among its Indian holdings. But many question Reliance's dependence on a data-focused network in a market where voice generates nearly 85 percent of carrier revenues. &amp;quot;Though we think RIL's entry into the telecom space cannot be ignored, we believe that for RIL to pose any credible threat to incumbents, a strong comprehensive voice business is an imperative,&amp;quot; Macquarie analysts wrote in a note on June 7. Reliance received a boost when India recently allowed 4G carriers to offer voice services by paying an extra fee. It is yet to decide whether to offer voice on its 4G airwaves using new technology or by tying up with an established voice carrier, a company source said. Reliance did not reply to emailed questions seeking comments on its 4G plans. While acknowledging scepticism towards his 4G venture, Ambani said at the shareholders meeting this month he was in the &amp;quot;optimistic minority&amp;quot; who held a bullish view of the sector. Executives at rival carriers play down the Reliance threat. &amp;quot;For them it is everything starting from scratch and we have a very serious headstart in this business,&amp;quot; said an official at a large rival telecoms carrier, declining to be named."

Dasgupta, who had previously alleged that Moily was favouring RIL by proposing a steep increase in gas prices, said the company is producing under 15 million standard cubic metres per day of gas against its own stated target of 80. Lower production, which was because RIL refused to drill wells it had committed when it got KG-D6 gas field capex hiked to USD 8.8 billion from USD 2.4 billion, had led to loss of 13,600 MW of electricity generation and 325 lakh tonnes of urea production, he told a press conference here.  While his predecessor S Jaipal Reddy had fined RIL over USD 1 billion for missing 2011-12 output target by 60 per cent, Moily has not initiated any such action for larger variation in subsequent 2012-13 and current fiscal, he said. &amp;quot;The same principle needs to be scrupulously applied for both 2012-13 and the current year as well,&amp;quot; he said reading out a letter he today wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the subject.  The government, he said, needs to disallow USD 1.7 billion of RIL's investment for production failing to meet target in 2012-13 and USD 3 billion for current year. &amp;quot;The Petroleum Minister (Moily) talks about giving incentives for (raising) production. What about disincentives for shortfall in production,&amp;quot; he said.  In the letter to Prime Minister, the Left leader said the UPA government believed only in giving &amp;quot;carrots to the corporates (but) there are no sticks to set them right when they indulge in wilful wrong doing.&amp;quot; Dasgupta said output lagging targets meant Rs 110,000 crore loss due to shortfall in power generation and urea production.  RIL had disputed the penalty imposed by Reddy and an arbitration initiated but since Moily took over the arbitration has been stalled, he alleged. &amp;quot;Can a Petroleum Minister decide unilaterally to thwart the arbitration proceedings to absolve a single corporate of its multi-billion contractual obligations,&amp;quot; he said. He alleged that output was kept deliberately low in therun-up to price revision due in April 2014.  Moily has proposed raising gas prices in the immediate to USD 6.7 per million British thermal unit from USD 4.2 and to USD 8-10 next year. &amp;quot;The arm-twisting policy of RIL is revealed, the fall in production (from KG basin) is synonymous with high demand,&amp;quot; he said adding that RIL has defrauded the country and it is still being pampered by the government.

Also Read: Govt to consider all views on gas price hike: FM The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had recommended to the ministry that RIL be asked to give up 86 percent of its KG-D6 gas block area, including eight gas discoveries worth at least USD 5 billion, saying the firm has overshot the time allotted to it for developing the area. &amp;quot;That is matter under examination,&amp;quot; Moily told PTI in an interview here. He said a decision on the matter will not be taken on mere technicality of rules and it would be taken keeping the energy security of the country in mind. &amp;quot;Automatically, technically applying rule is good for you (but) it is not good for the country,&amp;quot; he said without elaborating. Moily wants the country to explore aggressively so that more oil and gas is produced which will help cut the massive USD 160 billion foreign exchange outflow every year for buying oil. Rejecting RIL's offer to relinquish 4,233 sq km of &amp;quot;low prospectivity area&amp;quot; in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, the DGH had stated that the company should contractually give up 6,601 sq km out of the total 7,645 sq km total area in the block. In a 6-page note, Director General of Hydrocarbons R N Choubey on April 15 wrote to Oil Secretary Vivek Rae that of the 19 oil and gas discoveries claimed by RIL, three finds have not been established as commercially viable in absence of test data and the company has not submitted any investment plans for another five. He noted that the area proposed for cessation has at least 1.15 trillion cubic feet of known recoverable gas reserves valued at USD 4.83 billion at current prices. Asked about his ministry calling for applications for appointing a new DGH, Moily said he wants the technical arm of the ministry to be manned by a technocrat and not an IAS. &amp;quot;I want a technical man (at DGH). For last one or two years, we (have) continued with a non-technical man. It is not good (and) you don't get correct objective opinion,&amp;quot; he said. Choubey, a 1981 batch IAS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, was appointed DGH in June last year when S Jaipal Reddy was the Petroleum Minister. Moily took over in November last year. Moily said the new DGH will be selected from those who applied at close of application on May 31, by a panel comprising of secretaries headed by Oil Secretary Vivek Rae. The panel comprises Secretary to Department of Personnel and Training and Science and Technology Secretary, he said. To prevent companies from hoarding exploration acreage, they are contractually required to relinquish 25 percent area at the end of three years, 50 percent after another two years and are allowed to retain only areas where discovery is made after a total of seven years. RIL and its partner Niko Resources of Canada were awarded the KG-D6 block in 2000. The three-year Phase-1 ended on June 7, 2003 while the 2-year Phase-II expired on June 7, 2005. The third phase ended on June 7, 2007. Sources said DGH in 2006 agreed to RIL proposal of declaring the entire 7,645 sq km as discovery area, thereby allowing the company to retain the full area. The decision was ratified by a committee headed by Additional Secretary in the Ministry and by the Oil Minister thereafter. But the decision was questioned by government auditor CAG as at the end of the third phase, only 79 percent of the block area was covered by 3D seismic survey and yet the entire area was declared a discovery area. CAG, in its performance audit in 2011, had asked the Ministry to review determination of entire contract area of KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) as 'discovery area'. KG-D6 output has dipped from 69.43 million standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) achieved in March 2010, to under 15 mmscmd this month."

RIL counsel Janak Dwarakadas informed the SAT presiding officer Jog Singh that they could not file the reply as the company's appointed person could not prepare the papers as his father was hospitalised. The Sebi counsel noted that the continuous adjournments that the company is seeking will further delay the ongoing adjudication process into the case. The matter was last heard by SAT on February 21, when the tribunal sought time to study the application, which Sebi terms as &amp;quot;not maintainable&amp;quot;. Since then RIL has been seeking adjournment. The case was then adjourned in March, April and May and today as well. The Tribunal head told the RIL counsel that before the next hearing, slated for July 22 and which will be the final hearing, the company should file its response, failing which it would not entertain the reply. The case relates to RIL's appeal against the market regulator in a case related to alleged violation of insider trading norms in sale of shares of its erstwhile subsidiary RPL in 2007. RIL had approached SAT against Sebi after its application to settle the matter through a 'consent mechanism' was rejected by the regulator. Under Sebi's consent mechanism, companies can seek to settle cases with the market regulator after payment of certain charges and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. RIL has challenged Sebi's decision and also the recent changes made by the regulator in regulations governing settlement of cases through the consent mechanism, especially those already under consideration. In May 2012, Sebi had tightened the norms for settlement through consent framework. As a result, many cases, including those related to insider trading, are not being settled through this mechanism. On January 3 this year, the Sebi had published a list of 149 consent pleas, including 16 from entities related to RIL group, which it had found unsuitable for settlement through consent process. These include applications of RIL itself and that of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani's close aide Manoj Modi."

On completion of clearance process, exploration blocks are likely to be offered in 2013-14,&amp;quot; he said while addressing a meeting of the Parliamentary consultative committee in Mussoorie. While Moily did not indicate the number of blocks to be offered, officials said as many as 68 blocks or areas for exploration of oil and gas may be auctioned. This will be the second-highest offering of block since the advent of NELP 1999. Of the blocks being considered for offering in NELP-X, 25 are deep-water, 20 shallow-water and 23 onland blocks. The government has in previous nine rounds awarded 254 blocks for exploration of oil and gas. Last few rounds received tepid response with global majors staying away. Of the 34 areas offered in NELP-IX in 2010, bids were received for 33 blocks at the close of bidding on March 28, 2011. Of these, only 19 blocks were awarded. Moily said crude oil production in current fiscal is likely to rise to 39.396 million tonne (MT) in current fiscal from 37.762 MT in the last. Nearly 31 percent of last year's output came from private firms like Cairn India. Natural gas production on the other hand is expected to decline to 105 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in 2013-14 from 111.4 mmscmd in the previous fiscal, he said. The main reason for the dip is lower output from Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 field. &amp;quot;With the fresh investments in E and P sector, natural gas production is likely to further rise by end of 12th Five-Year Plan,&amp;quot; Moily said. NELP-VIII was the largest round with 70 blocks being offered. But only 32 blocks could be awarded. In NELP-VII, 41 blocks out of the 57 areas offered were awarded while NELP-VI was by far the most successful round with 52 out of 55 blocks on offer finding bidders. The first five bid rounds saw award of 107 blocks. India has an estimated sedimentary area of 3.14 million sqkms, comprising 26 sedimentary basins. At present, an area of 0.93 million sqkm area is held under exploration and production in 19 basins. &amp;quot;As of now, 73 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas could be established through exploration, out of 205 billion barrels of prognosticated hydrocarbon resources. Thus, about 133 billion barrels of prognosticated resources remain to be unlocked through exploration,&amp;quot; he said. "

It is a statement that has had timeless relevance. Unfortunately, it seems to losing some of that pertinence among heads of Corporate India. How else does one explain the disproportionate amount of time spent by these owner-executives on their IPL teams?",,"Business, Forbes, GMR Infra, India Cements, IPL, United Spirits",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ceos-how-about-switching-focusipl-back-to-business_884029.html,"Vishal BhargavaAchelous Advantage The fact that IPL is a scandal is not new. The tricks being played around would make even Al Capone smile. But that would be irrelevant if the companies owning these teams were private bodies not answerable to anyone except itself.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; First, let's examine the scope of the IPL with regards to its potential benefit for the owners. Valuation of any enterprise is tricky business. In the case of valuation of sporting teams, the task becomes even tougher. But let's try to simplify it.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Major football clubs have now seen valuations like any other commercial entity. Real Madrid, the most valuable soccer team in the world, is valued at USD 3.3 billion according to Forbes. The club generates an operating income of USD134 million. This implies a current price-to-earnings (where earnings are operating income) ratio of 25x - not the multiple that will make an investor grovel.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; It gets trickier when one is looking at baseball clubs in the US. New York Yankees, the highest valued club by some distance, are touted to have a valuation of USD 2.3 billion while operating income is a measly USD 1.4 million. L.A Dodgers are assessed at a valuation of USD 1.6 billion and operating income is USD 3.2 million. Besides these two clubs, there is sanity in the valuation of other baseball clubs ranging between 25x-30x.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; So - what is the scope when it comes to IPL? Executives of almost all franchisees concede they are in a loss or at best have just about broken even. The two key sources of revenue are fixed for franchisees - broadcasting and central sponsors. These two sources provide close to Rs 70-75 cr in revenues for the franchisees. It is the other sources that differentiate the profitability levels. These comprise primarily local sponsors, stadium sales and merchandise revenues. Local sponsors add up between Rs 20-30 cr in revenues. The two main expenses for the teams is the annual franchisee cost (bid amount that is to be paid annually for 10 years) and player expense. For a team like Mumbai Indians and RCB, these costs equal over Rs 100 cr. Besides these expenses, there are travel &amp;amp;amp; hotel expenses and marketing costs. Even with the assumption of reasonable stadium ticket profits (sales minus rent) and merchandise profits - profits are always likely to be minimal from the entire venture. If anything, with the continuous scandals engulfing the IPL - the biggest sources of revenues, broadcasting and sponsorship revenues may actually come down.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Commentators claim the brand also contributes to the overall valuation for a team.

The only one that has risen and risen significantly is United Spirits. Perhaps, they can take a cue from United Spirits which has seen a massive gain after Vijay Mallya exited some part of its stake and gave it to a more competent entity (Diageo) to run. Others should follow suit, exit the IPL and focus on the business that shareholders expected them to manage in the first place.

Moily thrashed CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta's allegations of favouring RIL as &amp;quot;totally false and baseless&amp;quot; and said the proposed increase in natural gas price was being done &amp;quot;strictly in line with the formula proposed by Prime Minister appointed panel headed by his economic adviser C Rangarajan.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is totally false and baseless. The new pricing, if approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), will apply to all gas produced in the country. Two-thirds of the gas produced in the country is by public sector companies (like ONGC) and the new pricing will apply equally to them and they stand to benefit more out of it,&amp;quot; he said. In a point-by-point rebuttal to allegations made by Dasgupta at a press conference on Thursday, Moily said the CPI leader &amp;quot;was wrong in saying that the petroleum ministry has deviated from the recommendations of Rangarajan Committee&amp;quot;. The allegations of a gigantic scam in making &amp;quot;are not only devoid of merits but also are malicious and based on distorted facts&amp;quot;. The price revision besides being contractual requirement, was needed to spur investment in oil and gas exploration which has stagnated over past few years, he said. Gas finds in deep-sea are not economically viable to develop at current rate of USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit. &amp;quot;Dasgupta talks of fertiliser subsidy rising due to gas price increase but what he does not realise is that if domestic production does not increase, we will have to import gas and imported gas (LNG) costs triple the domestic gas price,&amp;quot; Moily said. The government stands to gain from rise in domestic gas price by way of increased royalty, profit petroleum as well as taxes which can be used to make up for increased subsidy. Moily was attending an oil and gas conference in Bangkok when Dasgupta made the allegations at a press conference yesterday at New Delhi. &amp;quot;What Dasgupta is saying is totally baseless and incorrect. He may be ill-informed about facts,&amp;quot; Moily said, adding that the Rangarajan Committee was appointed by Prime Minister on a request from Moily's predecessor S Jaipal Reddy. The panel suggested pricing all domestically produced conventional and non-conventional gas at a mix of international hub prices and actual cost of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The price as per this formula came to USD 8, but in the note to CCEA, the oil ministry modified it to bring it down to USD 6.775 per mmBtu. &amp;quot;Spreading false information will scare away investors,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We need technology and investment to explore and produce more domestically so as to cut reliance on imports.&amp;quot; Moily said the Rangarajan panel formula has to be approved by the CCEA and views of the other ministries and Planning Commission shall be placed before the Cabinet for consideration. &amp;quot;The proposed pricing guidelines shall be equally applicable to both the private and public sector companies. It may also be highlighted that more than 60 per cent of the natural gas in India is still produced by the public sector companies. Therefore, the allegation that the price is being revised for the benefit of the private sector is completely misconceived,&amp;quot; a statement issued by the Ministry said. Moily also refuted Dasgupta's allegation that oil secretary Vivek Rae was not on the same page on gas price revision. &amp;quot;There is no question of Secretary opposing (gas price revision). We are only forwarding Rangarajan panel recommendations to the Cabinet.&amp;quot; Use of imported gas would result in 2 to 3 times higher subsidy outgo for fertiliser and power."

Ranged on one side, either covertly or overtly, are Reliance Industries, ONGC and other state-run oil and gas companies; on the other side are gas users &ndash; primarily the fertiliser and power companies. And then there are the warring ministries &ndash; oil, finance, fertilisers and power &ndash; battling on both sides. Under pressure from the gas producing companies, the UPA government set up the Rangarajan Committee which came up with a formula that would double gas prices from the current USD 4.2 per mmBtu (million metric British thermal units) to nearly USD 8.8 per mmBtu. Rangarajan&rsquo;s pricing was based on averaging traded prices at some global hubs, including the US's Henry Hub and the UK's National Balancing Point (NBP), among other things. It suggested that gas prices should be changed monthly based on its formula. There is already a godawful row on this recommendation. While Reliance and British Petroleum were unhappy with even this price, the power and fertiliser companies threw a fit, and the oil ministry went into another balancing act. Recently it came up with a cabinet note recommending a price of USD 6.8 per mmBtu, to be fixed quarterly. This price is midway between the current price and what Rangarajan recommended, indicating that the oil ministry is trying for a compromise. Business Standard, in an editorial today, suggests that gas should be priced based on the calorific value of imported coal &ndash; which would bring the price down to around USD5.5 per mmBtu. The newspaper notes: &ldquo;It bears repeating that gas pricing is highly contingent on variables that are specific to particular markets. Yet there are some broad facts about the Asian gas market that are relevant &ndash; for example, that liquid natural gas from the US is considered to become uneconomical in Asia when the price at the US&rsquo; Henry Hub is over USD6 per mmBtu.&rdquo; In India&rsquo;s case, the paper argues that gas prices need to be linked to Indonesian coal import prices. &ldquo;Given that India is a coal-dependent country and its coal import needs are rising rapidly, should it not use some form of coal equivalent pricing?&rdquo; The problem with all these formulae &ndash; whether it is the Rangarajan one or the oil ministry&rsquo;s mash-up or someone else&rsquo;s &ndash; is that they ignore a more fundamental point: why should the government at all be trying to decide this? If gas, coal and other forms of energy operate in a free market, prices will vary depending on local factors, including demand-supply balance, import-export duties, availability of comparable fuels, and transport economics. When governments try to fix prices, there is a 99 percent chance that they will get it wrong. The only solution to the issue of gas pricing is to let commercial entities &ndash; whether it is power or fertiliser plants, or even domestic and industrial gas distribution companies &ndash; float global tenders for long-term supplies to meet base demand and top this up with spot purchases when they face sudden spikes in short-term demand. It is not possible for babus sitting in Delhi to decide what is the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; price for gas. There is no right price for gas. There are various prices, and users have to decide if these work for them or not. In fact, even market pricing will not work for gas unless substitute fuels &ndash; oil, coal-bed methane, And coal, among other fuels &ndash; are also free to find their own levels. Trying to decide long-term gas prices with the help of IAS officials and former Reserve Bank Governors is like trying to predict next year&rsquo;s monsoon by looking at the skies this week. It&rsquo;s no different from astrology. It is time to abandon gas pricing by committee and political cabal, prodded by interested businessmen. The markets will get it right much better than all of them put together. Evidence: the US managed to get gas prices down to USD 4 merely by encouraging shale gas entrepreneurship and letting the markets do the rest. It is unlikely that grey eminences such as Rangarajan and politicians such as Veerappy Moily can work prices out better than the market.

ONGC/OIL and RIL currently get &amp;amp;#36;4.2 per million British thermal unit as the price of natural gas. The ministry wants Rangarajan Committee recommendation of pricing domestically produced natural gas at an average of international hub prices and cost of imported LNG instead of present mechanism of market discovery be accepted with a minor modification. Also Read: RIL restarts crude unit after brief shutdown Instead of Rangarajan panel's suggestion of calculating gas price every month, the ministry has proposed notifying the gas price on a quarterly basis. The gas price based on average of April-June rates would come to &amp;amp;#36;6.775 per mmBtu, much less than doubling of rates previously expected. Sources said the hike in natural gas price by &amp;amp;#36;1 would result Rs. 3,155 crore per annum hit on fertiliser plants for producing 23 million tons of urea this fiscal and Rs. 4,144 crore a year for 32 million tons of urea production from 2017-18. The impact of every US dollar increase in gas price would be about Rs. 10,040 crore per annum on the power sector for 28,000 MW of electricity generating capacity. Sources said ministry wants the pricing formula proposed by the panel to apply to all forms of natural gas -conventional, shale and coal-bed methane (CBM). Also, the price determined shall be applicable to all consuming sectors uniformly. They said it wanted the new pricing guidelines to apply from 2013 itself on all domestically produced gas barring cases where it is either governed by a definite formula prescribed in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) or the government had previously fixed a tenure for the same. This essentially meant that RIL would get the new price only from April 1, 2014 upon expiry of the fixed five-year term of current rate of USD 4.205 per mmBtu. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) can, however, get the new rates this year itself for gas they produce from fields given to them on nomination basis by the government. Gas from nominated fields, called APM gas, was last revised in June 2010 to &amp;amp;#36;4.2 from &amp;amp;#36;1.79. The Rangarajan panel suggested rates may also not apply to BG Group-operated Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields in the western offshore as the current rates of &amp;amp;#36;5.57-5.73 per mmBtu for the fuel produced from these are derived from a pre-defined formula detailed in the PSC. However, Cairn India's eastern offshore Ravva gas, which is currently priced at &amp;amp;#36;3.5-4.3 per mmBtu, may be revised as per the committee recommendations."

Ambani was eligible for a pay package of Rs 38.93 crore for the last fiscal year, which was higher by Rs 23.93 crore from the salary actually paid to him. In the preceding year 2011-12 also, Ambani had foregone Rs 23.82 crore from the remuneration approved for him by the shareholders.

The decision to cap Ambani's salary at Rs 15 crore was taken way back in October 2009, amid a raging debate on right-sizing of CEO salaries. The decision had led to a hefty pay cut for Ambani, as his remuneration dropped to Rs 15 crore for fiscal 2008-09, from over Rs 44 crore in 2007-08 wen he was India's top-paid executive. RIL's total payments towards remuneration of its key managerial personnel also remained unchanged at Rs 44 crore during 2012-13, after rising in the preceding year to this level from Rs 41 crore in 2010-11.

Without giving details of the RFDP, she said, &amp;quot;Clarifications have been sought from the operator RIL.&amp;quot; The company had filed revised field development plans for the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields as well as D-26 MA oil and gas field - the only producing areas among a total of 19 oil and gas discoveries made in KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Sources said the company has scaled down capex in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields to &amp;amp;#36; 5.928 billion from &amp;amp;#36; 8.836 billion two-phase spending it had proposed in 2006.

The RFDP for MA field has been approved. Lakshmi said as per the 2006 development plan, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields were to produce 61.88 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) from 22 wells in 2011-12 and 80 mmscmd from 31 wells in the year thereafter. &amp;quot;The average gas production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields of KG-D6 block during 2012-13 was about 20.88 mmscmd against the production target of 80 mmscmd,&amp;quot; she said. Gas production in April was about 15.89 mmscmd. The decline in gas output was due to half of the 18 wells put on production ceasing due to water loading/sand ingress. RIL has stated that gas output lagging projections was also due to &amp;quot;substantial variance in reservoir behavior and character being observed vis-a-vis the prediction and there seemed to be reservoir constraints in achieving the gas production rates,&amp;quot; the Minister said. Also, pressure decline was several times higher than originally envisaged and early water production in some of the wells was not predicted in the initial reservoir simulations, though overall field water production is small, she said. To a separate question, Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily said RIL has been asked to drill more wells and undertake remedial measures to revive the sick wells. Besides, the company's proposal to install compressor at onshore terminal to increase gas recovery from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 has been approved, he said adding that the development plan for another four satellite gas fields has also been approved."

Pronouncing Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd (RPIL) guilty of violating the insider trading regulations with regard to its dealings in shares of Indian Petrochemicals Corp Ltd (IPCL) in early 2007, SEBI said that RPIL made profits of over Rs 3.82 crore through these trades. After taking into account the quantum and nature of the violations, SEBI decided to impose a penalty of Rs 11 crore on RPIL, which was listed as one of the promoter entities by IPCL itself in its regulatory filings as on March 31, 2006, the regulator said in its 17-page late night order. The regulator said the penalty needs to be paid within 45 days to the account of &amp;quot;SEBI-Penalties Remittable to Government of India&amp;quot;. Once a subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), IPCL used to be a separately listed entity of the group, but was later merged with RIL and delisted from the stock exchanges. SEBI said in its order that its investigations into charges of insider trading norm violations by RPIL showed that the company was having control over IPCL as &amp;quot;promoter having control over the company with the total shareholding of approximately 46 percent&amp;quot;. Further, RIL was shown as a 'person(s) acting in concert' with RPIL with regard to the shareholding of IPCL, SEBI said. SEBI said it conducted an investigation in the trading of the shares of IPCL during the period from February 22, 2007 to March 08, 2007. In the same case, SEBI recently passed another order wherein it dropped the charges of violations of insider trading norms in IPCL shares against Manoj Modi and his wife. Modi is known as a close confidante of RIL chief Mukesh Ambani and held some senior positions at group entities in the past. But, SEBI said that the charges of insider trading violations could not be proved against Modi. SEBI's probe into the matter showed an irregular trading pattern in IPCL shares during the period under review, when two key announcements were made by the company -- one about an interim dividend payment and another regarding the amalgamation of IPCL with RIL. IPCL originally used to be a government-owned entity and was sold to RIL group during a disinvestment exercise. SEBI found that RPIL has violated the Prohibition of Insider Trading norms through its dealings in these shares while being in possession of &amp;quot;unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) while trading in the scrip of IPCL prior to announcement of declaration of interim dividend and amalgamation of IPCL with RIL&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;It is observed from the Investigation Report that RPIL received a dividend of approximately Rs 1.28 crore and made a notional profit of approximately Rs 2.54 crore (difference between acquisition cost of IPCL shares and market price of RIL shares on dealing dates based on average price). &amp;quot;Thus, the Noticee made a profit of approximately Rs 2.83 crore when in possession of UPSI relating to declaration of interim dividend and amalgamation of IPCL with RIL.&amp;quot; During the course of its inquiry, SEBI served a Show Cause Notice in January 2011, wherein RPIL and RIL were termed as 'insiders' on the basis of the shareholding patterns submitted by IPCL itself about their promoters and related entities. Besides, Mukesh Ambani was Chairman of IPCL, as well as Chairman and MD of RIL during the period under review, thus putting both the companies under same management, while RPIL held more than one-third of total voting power of IPCL at that time. Also, RIL held the entire share capital of RPIL through two wholly owned subsidiaries. _PAGEBREAK_ It was also stated in the show-cause notice that &amp;quot;RPIL was conceived by the management of RIL for the sole purpose of acquiring shares at the time of disinvestment by the Government in favour of RIL. &amp;quot;Further, it is observed that during the period June 9, 2006 to February 26, 2007 RPIL has not dealt in the shares of IPCL but all of sudden started buying the shares of IPCL from February 27, 2007, that is just before the major announcement of declaration of the interim dividend and amalgamation of IPCL with RIL,&amp;quot; the notice said. In its reply submitted in February 2011, RPIL sought an opportunity of inspection of all documents/information relied upon in the notice and an opportunity for the same was granted to the company by SEBI's Investigating Authority on October 18, 2011. However, the company later claimed that it was not shown all the documents. Later in November, 2011, the company however filed for settlement of the case through SEBI's 'consent mechanism'. However, SEBI rejected this plea after due consideration and informed RPIL about the same in November 2012. SEBI said in its order that RPIL did not reply to its show-cause notice in spite of lapse of more than one-and-a-half years, after which it called the company for personal hearing on October 22, 2012, after submit its reply by October 15, 2012. The company, however, sought a short extension of time to submit its reply and for the personal hearing. Later in November 2012, the reply was submitted to SEBI, wherein the company rejected the various charges made against it for violation of insider trading norms. After taking into account the relevant facts and regulations, and the submissions made by the company, SEBI, however, concluded that RPIL had indeed violated the insider trading norms and was liable to be penalised for the same. &amp;quot;From the Investigation Report it is noted that RIL holds the entire share capital of RPIL through two of its wholly owned subsidiaries. As per the Annual Report of RIL for the year 2005-06, RPIL is shown as an 'associate companies and joint ventures',&amp;quot; SEBI said. Besides, the purchase of shares of IPCL by RPIL was financed by Reliance Ventures Ltd (RVL) through an interest free loan, SEBI said, while adding that RVL was a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL. SEBI further said that K Sethuraman, Group Company Secretary of RIL, represented on behalf of RPIL before it, wherein it said that the orders for buying IPCL shares were placed by one Ashok C Jain, who is an employee of RIL. &amp;quot;It is also pertinent to mention that Sethuraman was the contact person on behalf of RIL for interacting with the legal advisor, valuers, financial advisors, etc., in the matter of merger of IPCL with RIL,&amp;quot; SEBI said. &amp;quot;Therefore, in view of the above findings, the charge of insider trading against the Noticee (RPIL) as per regulation ... Stands established,&amp;quot; the SEBI order said."

It started gas output from MA field and Dhirubhai-1&amp;amp;nbsp;and 3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries in the block, in April 2009. Of the rest, declaration of commerciality (DoC), the first step towards monetisation, for D29, 30, 31 and 42 has not been approved by DGH &amp;quot;because of lack of sustainable production test data which a production sharing contract (PSC) requirement,&amp;quot; the DGH wrote. The D-29, 30&amp;amp;nbsp;and 31 finds, according to DGH estimates, may hold 345 billion cubic metres (bcf)&amp;amp;nbsp;of recoverable reserves, valued at USD 1.45 billion. D-42, which holds 11.46 bcf recoverable gas reserves, lies within approved mining lease area of four satellite gas discoveries (D-2, 6, 19 and 22) and hence will have no bearing on relinquishment sought. DGH said RIL has not submitted field development plan for five gas finds&amp;amp;nbsp;- D-4, 7, 8, 16 and 23, containining 805 bcf of recoverable reserves worth USD 3.381 billion, even after expiry of timelines for the same as prescribed in PSC. Further, two discoveries&amp;amp;nbsp;- D-5 and&amp;amp;nbsp;18, were found to be not commercially viable. DGH proposed that RIL should be allowed to retain only an area of 1,044 sq km which will hold the currently producing D1 and D3 gas and MA oil and gas field besides a cluster of four satellite fields (D-2, 6, 19 and 22) and another D-34 discovery. RIL, had in its March 13 proposal, wanted to retain 3,412 sqkm of area containing all the oil and gas finds made till date. Sources said the company made the area relinquishment offer&amp;amp;nbsp;in March just as the oil ministry was readying an order asking the firm to vacate some 5,970 sqkm of KG-D6 block in first instance. Contractually, companies are required to relinquish 25 percent of the area in an oil and gas block at the end of first phase of exploration that spans three years. At the end of second phase, 50 percent of the area is to be given up and by the third phase only such area is allowed to be retained where the company has made a discovery and is required for development and production of the same. The second and third phases are of two years duration each. RIL and its partner Niko Resources of Canada were awarded the KG-D6 block in 2000. The three-year Phase-1 ended on June 7, 2003 while the two-year phase-II expired on June 7, 2005. The third phase ended on June 7, 2007. Sources said DGH in 2006 agreed to RIL proposal of declaring the entire 7,645 sq km as discovery area, thereby allowing the company to retain the full area. The decision was ratified by a committee headed by additional secretary in the ministry and by the petroleum minister thereafter. But the decision was questioned by government auditor CAG as at the end of the third phase, only 79 percent of the block area was covered by 3D seismic survey and yet the entire area was declared a discovery area. CAG in its performance audit in 2011 had asked the ministry to review determination of entire contract area of KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) as &lsquo;discovery area&rsquo;. KG-D6 output has dipped from 69.43 million standard cubic metres a day achieved in March 2010, to under 16 mmscmd in April."

The Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas, in its report tabled in Parliament, noted with concern that the output from KG-D6 has been declining since 2010-11.&amp;quot;From a peak of 80 million standard cubic meters per day, the gas production from KG-D6 has gone down to 16 mmsmd,&amp;quot; it said.  Stating that it has not been informed of any valid reason for lower production of gas in KG-D6 block, the panel said it has noted RIL's demand for higher natural gas price.&amp;quot;The Committee would strongly urge the Ministry to adequately satisfy itself and convince the nation that the fall in production of natural gas in KG-D6 block is not due to commercial consideration or&amp;amp;nbsp; price at which the gas is to be sold,&amp;quot; the report said.  It asked the ministry to seriously look at the fall in output and take urgent steps to increase production. &amp;quot;The Committee also expects the Ministry to apply the provisions of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the contractor (RIL) strictly in letter and spirit in respect of latter's failure to deliver committed production of natural gas from KG-D6,&amp;quot; the report said. RIL produced 39.31 mmscmd of gas from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3), the main gas fields in KG-D6 block, in first year of production 2009-10 as against a target of 27.62. The output in 2010-11 was 48.13 as opposed to a target of 53.40 mmscmd. Thereafter, production fell to 35.33 mmscmd in 2011-12 as compared to the target of 61.88 mmscmd and to 13.06 mmscmd&amp;amp;nbsp; presently as against a target of 80 mmscmd. The main reason for the fall was water and sand ingress in wells.  MA oilfield in the same block saw output price to 7.76 mmscmd in 2010-11 before dropping to 5.36 mmscmd this year. The&amp;amp;nbsp; committee said as part of corrective measures, RIL has been asked to drill more wells and install a compressor to increase the gas recovery. "

Also increase in spread between light-heavy crude oil by US USD0.6/bbl to US USD4.6/bbl has helped RIL GRMs for the quarter.

The better performance during the quarter has come only from refining segment and higher other income. However it&rsquo;s too early to expect a sustained recovery in petchem margins. We maintain our outlook of weak refining cycle going ahead on the back of higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. Structurally, refining cycle is expected to remain weak with incremental net refining capacity additions expected to the tune of 1mbpd/1.3mbpd in 2012 / 2013, as against demand growth of 0.8mbpd / 1mbpd. In case of petchem, demand remains a concern and any weakness in demand could impact any sustained recovery in margins. Gas production from KG basin is expected to decline further and is not expected to reverse the trend before FY15. Positive government stance towards RIL&rsquo;s E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts augurs well for the company but its still time before results come up. We remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of new capacities and/or weakening demand. The stock currently trades at FY15E PE multiple of 12.5x and 1.6x P/BV.

However, even as Reliance Industries (RIL) posted a significant&amp;amp;nbsp;year-on-year rise in its March quarter profit boosted by higher other income and an improvement in gross refining margin, it's exploration and production division may continue to be a drag in ensuing quarters, say analysts. Analysts who met RIL management post Q4 earnings announcement said there is no news on further exploration in KG-D6. Currently, volumes are already low at around 16 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) and there will not be any meaningful impact on overall profitability even if volumes improve slightly going ahead.

This more than doubled the operating profit for the refining and marketing segment to Rs 3520 crore. However, the company may find it difficult to sustain margins due to threat of cheaper imports. Going ahead, will RIL's new businesses impact bottomline?RIL has already invested about Rs 9500 crore in retail business andAround USD 570 crore in shale gas business.

The retail business turned positive at the EBITDA level in FY13 but continues to have negative net income. The shale gas business reported net income of USD 7.2 crore for FY13. The two businesses are growing but will not contribute significantly to bottomline so soon. Meanwhile, shares of the company declined over 2 percent to Rs 787.60 post Q4 earnings announcement.

RIL reported a 15 per cent spike in exports to USD 44.1 billion (Rs 2,39,226 crore) from USD 37.48 billion last fiscal. This was 60 per cent of the company's overall revenue of USD 68.4 billion (Rs 3,71,119 crore) in FY13.  Agarwal attributed the spike in exports to the higher demand for diesel and petrol from Asia, particularly China, during the year. &amp;quot;Rising demand from Asia, driven by China and other countries with low refining capacity like Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia and Singapore pushed our exports. The rising demand spiked prices, which in turn improved our export numbers,&amp;quot; he said. Due to the global headwinds, India's exports were on downhill in FY13 and are all set to miss the initial target of USD 350 billion. In FY12, the exports touched USD 306 billion, the highest ever.  RIL posted a massive 32 per cent jump in Q4 net profit at Rs 5,589, the biggest rise in almost three years, as strong margins in its oil refining business helped offset fall in natural gas production. The better-than-estimated profit, the second consecutive quarter of increase after four quarters of decline, came on the back of rise in earnings from turning crude oil into petrol, diesel and other fuel products.  RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said &amp;quot;the growth in earnings was largely driven by strong and improved refining margins during the year.&amp;quot;"

RIL on April 2 shut the well A1 on the main producing fields of Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) in Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 for &amp;quot;reservoir build-up study,&amp;quot; according to a status report of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).  The company has been forced to shut the previous eight wells due to high volumes of water and sand seeping in, which affected production. It had previously shut well B6, the eighth well to be closed on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, on January 9 and B4, the seventh well, on November 29 last year.  Also read: GSPC seeks USD 14.2 per mmBtu price for KG basin gas The latest shutting led to the output slipping from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 to 11.70 mmscmd in the week April 7, the report said. Together with 4.09 mmsmcd from MA oilfield in the same block, the output totalled 15.79 mmscmd in the week.  However, the production has since plummeted further to 15.50 mmscmd this week, the lowest level since D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 started production in April 2009.  RIL has so far drilled 22 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields but has put only 18 on production so far. Half of these wells are now shut.  KG-D6 fields, which began production in April 2009, had hit a peak of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down of wells after wells.  This peak output comprised of 66.35 mmscmd from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries on the KG-D6 block, and 3.07 mmscmd from MA field, the only oil discovery on the block.  Besides the fall in output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, gas production from MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, too has dropped.  The report said MA field produced about 6,235 barrels per day of oil during the week ended April 7.  Of the 15.79 mmscmd of gas production from KG-D6, 13.50 mmscmd was sold to urea manufacturing fertiliser plants. &amp;quot;No sale was made to power plants during the period,&amp;quot; it said.  The remaining 2.29 mmscmd was consumed by LPG manufacturing plants and the pipeline that transports the KG-D6 gas, it said.  RIL, the report said, has projected an output of 15.50 mmscmd in April.  The company has so far made 18 gas and one oil discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin block in Bay of Bengal. While the lone oil find, MA went on stream in September 2008, largest among the gas finds, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 were put on production in April, 2009. "

The MJ-1 exploration well on the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block has sniffed natural gas while drilling, sources privy to the development said. The drilling, they said, has not yet been completed and the company will decide on testing the natural gas found once the well reaches target depth by this weekend.  Also read: Bothra upbeat on RIL, ONGC, HPCL, BPCL The well is being drilled over 2 km deeper than, and directly beneath, the producing D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in the block. Sources said the resource found may be significantly more than RIL's a pre-drill best case gross prospective resource of 819 billion cubic feet of gas and 56 million barrels of liquids for the well. The well is targeting a Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir, similar to the producing MA oil and gas field in the same block. RIL had drilled MJ-1 well in early March after the government permitted companies to drill exploration wells in areas where exploration period had long expired. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields, the largest among the 18 gas finds on KG-D6 block, have proved to be more difficult to produce than previously predicted. RIL has drilled the probe well on the fields to study reservoir characteristic, sources said. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 reservoir has seen sharper-than-expected drop in pressure and water and sand ingress in production wells, leading to a drop in output. The fields have seen output fall from 53-54 million cubic metre per day achieved in March, 2010 to about 12 mscmd this month. Together with less than 6 mscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 is producing about 17 mscmd. MJ-1 well will probe the Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir lying below the D1-D3 (Pliocene) Mining Lease area. While RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 percent interest, UK&rsquo;s BP Plc holds 30 percent and Niko has the remaining 10 percent. Sources said RIL had more than a year back proposed to drill the MJ-1 well but permission for that came this year.  The approval came with the riders that the cost of such wells will not be allowed to be recovered unless it leads to a commercial oil and/or gas discovery. Sources said RIL and its partners will invest USD 350-450 million in the KG-D6 block in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 and USD 400-500 million in the year to March 31, 2015. The investments include expansion of water handling and compression facility at D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, additional gas production well and compressor modification on the MA field and drilling of the MJ-1 prospect.  &amp;amp;nbsp;"

GSPC on Friday submitted to the oil ministry a proposal for pricing of 5.24 million standard cubic metre per day of peak output from its Deen Dayal West (DDW) gas field in block KG-OSN-2001/3 at USD 14.2 per million British thermal unit, industry sources said. Also read: GSPC takes cue from RIL, seeks LNG price of KG gas This price, the firm said, was arrived at through an arms length price discovery exercise it carried out for over a month with supervision of a neutral third party auditor. GSPC had on February 25 asked bidders to quote a positive or a negative number to be added to India's liquefied natural gas (LNG) import formula of 12.67 percent of Brent crude oil plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. GSPC prescribed a minimum sale price of USD 8.50 per mmBtu, at floor rate of USD 65 per barrel of oil. Sources said 37 companies put in as many as 53 bids for about 75 mmscmd. A demand far exceeding the supply was generated when the biddable variable was kept at zero. At cap oil price of USD 110 per barrel, the gas price translates into USD 14.2 per mmBtu. This is the same formula on which RIL had sought bids to price gas from its Sohagpur coal-bed methane (CBM) block in Madhya Pradesh. While the oil ministry, under the then oil minister S Jaipal Reddy, held back the approval for RIL's CBM gas price discovery by putting repeat queries, it remains to be seen how GSPC's proposal will be treated by the ministry under M Veerappa Moily.  Phone calls made to GSPC managing director Tapan Ray seeking comments went unanswered. RIL also had got overwhelming response when over 70 bids totalling a demand of more than 90 mmscmd, several times more than the peak CBM output of 3.5 mmscmd, were received. Its proposal has, however, been languishing in the ministry for 13 months now. Petronet LNG Ltd, of which oil secretary is the chairman, pays RasGas of Qatar a price of 12.67 percent of the average price of crude oil imported into Japan (called Japan Crude Cocktail, or JCC). Besides, it incurs a USD 0.26 per mmBtu cost on transporting the gas in ships from the Gulf nation. Both RIL and GSPC felt this is an arms-length pricing formula and called for bids from consumers on the same.GSPC will produce a maximum of 5.24 mmscmd of gas from the offshore DDW gas field. The gas will land at Mallavaram, near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, and can be ferried to customers up to Gujarat through Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd's East-West pipeline. While the price sought is excluding taxes and other levies, the firm will charge an additional marketing margin of Rs 10.21 per mmBtu."

SAT has asked Sebi to file a reply within four weeks and RIL to respond to that reply in another four weeks. The case relates to RIL's associate firms short selling Reliance Petroleum (RPL) futures in 2009 a few days ahead of RIL selling shares of RPL in the open market.  RIL has argued that its application for settling the case under consent was rejected despite a Sebi letter, which clarified that the matter was open for consent.  RIL said that Sebi did not provide the 28 documents it had asked for. Also, the High Powered Advisory Committee rejected the company&rsquo;s consent plea, when it can only give recommendations, argued RIL. It is the panel of Whole Time Members which has to take the final decision RIL said, adding that it was challenging the process and not the final order. Sebi has countered RIL&rsquo;s argument saying that no party can compel Sebi to hear matters for consent. Also, the HPAC's rejection of RIL's plea was in line with the Sebi circular issued in May last year, which said that serious offences like insider trading, front running and net asset value manipulation cannot be settled under consent.

The plan envisaged drilling of one gas well (MA-8) to augment gas production from the field and side tracking of two ceased wells (MA-6H and MA-7H). The Management Committee, which had in August last year approved the revised field development plan for MA, on March 26 approved drilling of MA-8 well, sources said. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 percent stake. UK's BP plc holds the 30 percent and the remaining 10 percent is with Niko Resources of Canada. The company had also in August last year submitted a revised FDP for the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields where water and sand ingress has pulled down production of around 12 million standard cubic meters per day from peak of about 54 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. Together with less than 5 mmsmcd of output from MA field, gas production from KG-D6 is around 16.5 mmsmcd. RIL has so far drilled six wells on the MA oilfield, the only oil discovery among the 19 oil and gas finds the company had made in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Besides producing oil, the field also produces natural gas. But the closure of two out of the six wells due to high water and sand ingress has led to drop in output from over 8 mmscmd three years ago to less than 5 mmscmd this month."

Also read: Rel Comm jumps 6% post Rel Jio deal; ADAG stocks surge A number of investment banks in their research reports today hailed the deal, saying it was strategic in nature for both cash-rich RIL and debt-laden RCOM, especially in the backdrop of difficult times prevailing in the telecom sector. It is the first business collaboration between the two Ambani brothers ever since the parted ways with split of their family business in 2005. The two firms have said that the deal is first in a comprehensive business cooperation framework for optimal utilisation of existing and future infrastructure. &amp;quot;We believe this to be a win-win situation for both RIL and RCOM,&amp;quot; analysts at Morgan Stanley said in their report. &amp;quot;It should result in optimum utilisation of RCOM's existing untapped infrastructure, and RIL will avoid incurring huge capex, gaining access to readily available telecom infrastructure for its telecom / 4G foray. &amp;quot;This is in line with our expectation that RIL will follow an asset-light approach for its telecom business, helping it to protect its Return on Capital Employed,&amp;quot; they said. While Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group is present in telecom business through RCOM, RIL group is gearing up to launch 4G services through Reliance Jio Infocomm. Another report by Barclays said that the agreement was a positive for RIL and it gives it access to 120,000 km of nationwide intercity optic fibre network for a one-time fee for Rs 1,200 crore with no recurring charges. UBS analysts in their report said that their &amp;quot;brief discussion with management suggests more such network/infrastructure sharing arrangement, including tower sharing/leasing will follow with RCOM / other vendors&amp;quot;. UBS report further observed that RIL's recent strategies, including its non-participation in 2G auction and signing of infrastructure sharing agreements, suggest a rational approach towards telecom business. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they see potential for more cooperation going forward, for example, in telecom tower or intra-city fibre network sharing, while adding that the deal was strategic merit from a long-term growth perspective. Shares of RIL, however, fell in the stock market by 2.16 percent to Rs 776.8, while those of RCOM closed 1.9 percent higher at Rs 64.50 after paring most of the intra-day gains."

Yesterday, Rae said, &amp;quot;The audit will happen. We are pretty clear about that. We are making all efforts to see that CAG is able to perform its duty.&amp;quot; RIL had previously stated that CAG cannot contractually perform a performance audit on it and Production Sharing Contract (PSC) only provides for a government appointed auditor to verify reasonableness of all charges and credits.  CAG too has now stated that it is not planning to a do a performance audit of the company but only wants to examine &amp;quot;propriety&amp;quot; of expenses made. For doing that, CAG wants the discretion for records to be requisitioned to be vested with the government or its auditor (CAG). &amp;quot;Whatever records are sought will have to be made available,&amp;quot; Rae had said on March 24, adding once the issue of scope of audit is resolved there should be no issues about records being made available. CAG had on March 12 written to the Oil Ministry that its audit of KG-D6 &amp;quot;would be financial and propriety audit&amp;quot; and the purpose of such scrutiny was to ensure that &amp;quot;the government's financial interests have been safeguarded&amp;quot;.

Stating that such audit should be a financial scrutiny, the Ministry told CAG that the provisions of PSC provide for a government appointed auditor inspecting and auditing all records and documents supporting costs, expenses, receipts and income. _PAGEBREAK_ CAG has said it was in agreement with this scope of audit provided the ministry agreed with it on the issue of requisition of records and access. The auditor said that its six-member audit team was at premises of RIL in Navi Mumbai from January 9 to January 31 during which they issued 40 requisitions calling for information and records. However, RIL provided only a few records.On oil and gas exploration, Rae said, the focus area is that the companies, which are exploring oil and gas right now, should be permitted to explore shale gas as well. If two companies start working on the same block then there will be problems. &amp;quot;That is why, we are trying to allowthe operator to explore shale gas in the same block,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;We are making a policy on that which will go to the Cabinet first. Whatever the Cabinet will decide that will be final. Our effort will be to allow existing operators also to explore shale gas, which is the fastest way to get it done. We want speed right now,&amp;quot; Rae said. Further, he said, the biggest challenge for the sector is to &amp;quot;unleash the forces of the government&amp;quot; and the private sector to explore actively for oil and gas in the country as this is not an &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; task. There are huge problems in the exploration blocks that are ongoing. There are controversies and the progress has been slow, he said. Talking about the capex plan of oil companies in public sector, he said, &amp;quot;In the 11th Plan, the target was about Rs 2.26 lakh crore and we did Rs 2.69 lakh crore. In the 12th Plan, it has been increased to Rs 4.38 lakh crore from Rs 2.69 lakh crore.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;So the capex that will be generated by these oil companies through internal resources and through borrowing is being spent, despite the bottlenecks and regulatory hurdles,&amp;quot; he said.  The scenario is not all that gloomy and there are sectors where implementation is happening, he said adding that in the oil sector if money is being spent that means implementation is happening. "

RCom has around 50,000 towers, of which a large number is linked with a fibre-optic backbone, critical for high-speed data transfer. A tower sharing deal between both companies seems likely as it would be economical for RJI to rent out towers rather than build towers on its own to launch its pan-India 4G services, states ICICI Direct in a report released post the deal. What does it mean for Reliance Communications? The optic fibre deal would fetch RCom&amp;amp;nbsp;an one-time fee of Rs 1200 crore and a recurring rental revenue depending on the tariff and bandwidth usage by RJI.  In addition to this, a tower sharing deal could generate an annualincremental EBITDA of&amp;amp;nbsp; Rs 700-750 crore with additional tenancy of 0.4 times on its towers. Also, with the increase in tenancy Reliance Infratel would attract better valuation making it easier for RCom to hive it off and help reduce its mounting debt burden of over Rs 37000 crore,&amp;amp;nbsp;says ICICI Securities. Meanwhile, the deal also talks about further sharing of infrastructure in future on reciprocal basis between both companies.

Most analysts feel this is the right move for Rel Comm. According to Karan Mittal, telecom analyst, ICICI Direct the deal will earn an incremental contribution of Rs 240-250 crore per annum to Rel Comm. &amp;quot;Though the deal doesn't give a lot of leeway in terms of debt reduction but the overall long-term visibility and the valuation for the tower company could improve,&amp;quot; he said an interview to CNBC-TV18.  Edelweiss feels that arrangement is a key positive for Rel Comm as the arrangement with help to monetise its assets and deleverage balance sheet. However, the brokerage maintains hold/ sector underperformer rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 80.  However, JP Morgan is underweight on Rel Comm. JP Morgan explains that Rel Comm has weak operational performance and stretched balance sheet. &amp;quot;If Reliance&amp;amp;nbsp;Jio enters into more significant agreements to use Reliance Communication's tower assets, it could be a big positive for the company,&amp;quot; it said.

The MJ-1 exploration well on the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block &amp;quot;was spud in early March and is drilling ahead,&amp;quot; said Niko Resources, the firm's minority partner in the Krishna Godavari basin block.  The well is targeting a Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir, similar to the producing MA oil and gas field in the same block.  The well be drilled over two kilometres deeper than and directly beneath the producing D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in the block.  Results of the well are expected in April or May, Niko said.  RIL has given the well a pre-drill best case gross prospective resource of 819 billion cubic feet of gas and 56 million barrels of liquids.  Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields, the largest among the 18 gas finds on KG-D6 block, have proved to be more difficult to produce than previously predicted and RIL is drilling a probe well on the fields to study reservoir characteristic, sources said.  D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 reservoir has seen sharper-than-expected drop in pressure and water and sand ingress in production wells, leading to a drop in output.  The fields have seen output fall from 53-54 million cubic metre per day achieved in March, 2010 to about 12 mscmd this month. Together with less than 6 mscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 is producing about 17 mscmd.  MJ-1 well will probe the Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir lying below the D1-D3 (Pliocene) Mining Lease area.  While RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, UK's BP Plc holds 30 per cent and Niko has the remaining 10 per cent.  Sources said RIL had more than a year back proposed to drill the MJ-1 well but permission for the same came only this year.  The approval came with the riders that the cost of such wells will not be allowed to recovered unless it leads to a commercial oil and/or gas discovery.  Sources said RIL and its partners will invest USD 350-450 million in the KG-D6 block in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 and USD 400-500 million in the year to March 31, 2015.  The investments include expansion of water handling and compression facility at D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, additional gas production well and compressor modification on the MA field and drilling of the MJ-1 prospect.

Rae said CAG too has stated that it is not planning to a do a performance audit of the company but only wants to examine &amp;quot;propriety&amp;quot; of expenses made. For doing that CAG wants the discretion for records to be requisitioned to be vested with the government or its auditor (CAG). &amp;quot;Whatever records are sought will have to be made available,&amp;quot; he said, adding once the issue of scope of audit is resolved there should be no issues about records being made available. CAG had on March 12 written to the Oil Ministry that its audit of KG-D6 &amp;quot;would be financial and propriety audit&amp;quot; and the purpose of such scrutiny was to ensure that &amp;quot;the government's financial interests have been safeguarded&amp;quot;.

Stating that such audit should be a financial scrutiny, the Ministry told CAG that the provisions of PSC provide for a government appointed auditor inspecting and auditing all records and documents supporting costs, expenditures, expenses, receipts and income. CAG said it was in agreement with this scope of audit provided the ministry agreed with it on the issue of requisition of records and access. The auditor said that its six-member audit team was at premises of RIL in Navi Mumbai from January 9 to January 31 during which they issued 40 requisitions calling for information and records. But RIL provided only a few records."

According to a Deutsche Bank AG report issued after its analysts met one of the company's two joint chief financial officers (CFOs), &amp;quot;RIL is at the cusp of its next capex cycle as it invests USD 27 billion over 2013-14 to 2016-17 fiscal.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; About 85 per cent of the capex will be in its core business, the report said. RIL will spend USD 11 billion in oil and gas exploration including US shale gas venture and USD 4 billion in refining business. Another USD 8 billion is planned in petrochemical projects while USD 3 billion would go into its yet to be launched telecom venture. The rest USD 1 billion would go into retail business, it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani had last year announced plans to invest Rs 100,000 crore across energy, retail and telecom businesses in the next five years to double operating profit. It is in the process of getting regulatory nod for putting to production newer and satellite gas fields to arrest the decline in output from the main fields on the KG-D6 block. RIL is investing USD 8 billion, the most since it completed a second oil refinery in 2008, in expansion of its petrochemical business to meet rising demand of plastics and polyester. Also, it is setting up a USD 4 billion petroleum coke gasification project that will produce synthetic natural gas that will replace expensive LNG as fuel. &amp;quot;After our detailed meeting with the Joint CFO of RIL, we came out more convinced on our bullish view on RIL,&amp;quot; the report said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Our positive view on RIL is premised on expectation of approval for gas price increase in FY14, approvals for KGD6 R-Series and NEC-25 development plans in FY14 improving visibility on monetisation of these discoveries, and start of a new capex cycle,&amp;quot; it said. The most significant catalyst improving visibility on monetisation of existing discoveries will be approval for a hike in the domestic natural gas price. The company currently get USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit price of gas produced from KG-D6 block. &amp;quot;The company has submitted a development plan for KG-D6 R-Series and will soon submit the same for (the separate) NEC-25 (block),&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Coupled with the approved KG-D6 Satellite fields, RIL is targeting development of over 4 Trillion cubic feet of recoverable resources.&amp;quot; RIL management believes there is further scope for faster approvals so as to increase domestic production."

Analysts, who were quoted in reports&amp;amp;nbsp;had met RIL management recently, wherein executives re-iterated their last year's capex plan. In its 38th annual general meeting last year, chairman Mukesh Ambani had said that the company hopes to produce an additional 30 million cubic metres per day of gas at its KG D6 field. and had also set a target of 60 million cubic meters a day (mmscmd) gas output from KG D6 in two to three years. The company plans to grow by entering into partnerships in the oil and gas sector globally, he had said. What has perhaps boosted the company's confidence is the government's assurance to clear 34 out of the 39 oil and natural gas projects pending security clearance. The Cabinet Committee on Investment has already taken up the projects for speedy approvals. Meanwhile, the remaining 15 percent capex is earmarked for telecom and retail segments, which are considered engines of growth for the company. The firm is increasing its polyester capacity by 1.5 million tonne by next year. RIL is also looking to&amp;amp;nbsp;offer specialised content in key domain areas like education, healthcare, security, entertainment and financial services. As far as telecom plans are concerned, RIL is looking to offer voice telephony and data services through its pan Indian 4G network, on its own after the Telecom Commission last month&amp;amp;nbsp;decided to allow firms with broadband wireless access spectrum to offer voice services after paying a fee.

Besides RIL, French energy giant Total, Russia's Lukoil, CNPC of China and American firm Brown Energy have been shortlisted for the project, according to Iraq's Oil Ministry. Russia's Zarubezhneft and JGC &amp;amp;amp; Tonen General of Japan are the other two shortlisted from 14 companies that expressed interest in taking up the multi-billion dollar project.  The seven qualified firms will now be invited to review data packages and discuss contract terms. Iraq intends to award the project by year end. The OPEC nation has three main refineries - Baiji, Daura and Basra -- with a total capacity of around 567,000 barrels per day (bpd). It wants to increase the refining capacity to 750,000 bpd through improvements in existing plants.  It also plans four new refineries in Karbala, Kirkuk, Missan and in Nassiriya. &amp;quot;The Al-Nasiriya Integrated Project contemplates the development of the 4+ billion barrel Nasiriya oil field in Thi-Qar province together with the construction and operation of a new 300,000 bpd refinery,&amp;quot; Iraq's Petroleum Contracts &amp;amp;amp; Licensing Directorate (PCLD), part of the Ministry of Oil, said. The international engineering and construction firm Foster Wheeler recently completed a Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) study for the refinery. The Nasiriya project marks re-entry of RIL into Iraq. The company's Dubai-based arm Reliance Exploration and Production DMCC had in 2007 taken a 100 per cent stake in the Rovi and Sarta blocks in Kurdistan.  Baghdad termed the award of exploration contract to RIL and other firms by the autonomous Kurdistan region as illegal and threatened to blacklist any firm that dealt with the Kurds. A year after the blacklisting threat, RIL did not apply for being shortlisted for development of oil fields in Iraq.  Thereafter, it did not figure in the list of companies applying to bid for successive licensing rounds of Iraq. RIL finally got rid of the Kurd blocks in July last year when it sold its stake to Chevron Corp for an undisclosed sum. With the Kurd baggage off its back, the company is back at doing business with Iraq and applied to be qualified for the Nassiriya project. After years of war and sanctions, Iraq aims to produce 5-6 million bpd of crude by 2015 against a current output of 3.4 million bpd, the highest in three decades."

Sources said the Ministry wrote that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) was being requested to undertake the audit of block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 of RIL for 2008-09 to 2011-12 under Section 20 of the C&amp;amp;amp;AG (DPC) Act, 1971.

Also read: RIL rises 1% as Credit Suisse maintains outperform rating These provisions of PSC provide for a government appointed auditor inspecting and auditing all records and documents supporting costs, expenditures, expenses, receipts and income.

RIL has been insisting that CAG can only do a financial audit and not a Performance Audit and had refused to share some documents sought by the auditor to begin the scrutiny in January.Following this, CAG suspended the audit, sources said. The Ministry, which had given written commitment to RIL that the audit will strictly be in accordance with the contractual provisions, is now sorting out the matter, they said. Sources said the Ministry did not explain the significance of it quoting Section 20 of the C&amp;amp;amp;AG (DPC) Act of 1971 as well as Article 25.5 and Article 25.6 and the Appendix C of the PSC. Section 20 deals with audit of accounts of entities that have not been entrusted to CAG by the law. The terms and conditions of audit of such entities are to be settled between government and CAG, the Section states. RIL too had been in its submissions stating that a private company like it can be audited by CAG only under Section 20 and the Ministry can make CAG its nominee to carry out audit the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits. Sources said the Ministry asked CAG to revert back if its proposition was acceptable to it so as to enable the audit process to move forward."

Sources said 30 per cent of the 7,645 square kilometre KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin overlapped with the Navy's firing and exercise area and was branded a &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; zone by the Ministry of Defence. MoD was of the view that any exploration and production activities near its Naval Base would hamper surveillance and detection operations and the noise generated due to exploration activities would also compromise the sonar andother radar functionalities. RIL agreed to relinquish 495 sq km of area that fell in the &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; area, following which Navy agreed to realign the boundary required for naval operations for its proposed base to allow oil and gas activities in the remainder of the block.

No exploration and production activity will be permitted in this zone. Beyond the &amp;quot;no-go&amp;quot; area, oil and gas explorationactivities will be permitted. However, ONGC's two KG basin block KG-OSN-2005/1 and KG-OSN-2005/2 have not been cleared as they fall directly within the boundary of the proposed naval base. Also, the firm's KG-OSN-2009/4 block fell within the range of DRDO's Machhlipatnam launch site and IAF's Suryalanka Guided WeaponFiring Range (GWFR). BG's block KG-DWN-2009/1 falls right at the entry of the proposed naval base (AOB) and hence the Navy could not grant clearance while Cairn's KG-OSN-2009/3 block was in the proximity of the Suryalanka GWFR.  Besies classifying seven blocks as &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; areas, the MoD imposed stringent conditions for another 32. The newly constituted Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) in January-end had asked MoD and Ministry of Petroleumand Natural Gas to sort out differences over the seven block in one month and for the 32 areas in three months. Sources said the Petroleum Ministry was of the view that oil and gas exploration and defence activities can co-exist as was the practice in several countries, including in US. Originally, the Defence Ministry had declared 14 blocks as &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; areas as they over-lapped or were close to proposed Naval base or missile launching range/air force exercise area. But the Defence Ministry later relented and agreed for exploration to be permitted in 7 blocks in Mahanadi basin. One more block which had previously objected to by the Commerce Ministry too had been cleared, bringing down the number of blocks awaiting clearances from 47 to 39. Sources said companies like RIL had already invested close to USD 16 billion in the 39 blocks since 2000 after getting approval from the Defence Ministry at every stage - first for beginning seismic survey, then for drilling wellsand then for constructing permanent oil and gas facilities. Oil Ministry officials insisted that Defence Ministry cannot withdraw the clearance after 12 years of exploration. Blocks like KG-D6 were awarded to companies since 2000 by the Cabinet after clearance from all ministries concerned including the Ministry of Defence. "

According to the research firm, the Sensex EPS is expected to report a moderate 6.3% growth to Rs 1,195 in FY2013 and a more robust 16.1% growth to Rs 1,387 in FY2014. The earnings performance for 3QFY2013 came in below our expectations owing to the slower-than-expected pace of revenue growth. Margin pressure, though, has largely stabilized as margin compression during the quarter was lower than expected. Sensex companies, during 3QFY2013, reported an earnings growth of 9.4% yoy (5.5% yoy excluding ONGC) as compared to our growth estimate of 11.0% yoy. Our coverage companies reported a subdued 5.5% yoy earnings growth (2.8% yoy excluding ONGC) as compared to our growth estimate of 10.0% yoy. Corporate earnings continue to feel the heat owing to slowdown in economic activity, weak capex and high interest rates. Sensex companies witnessed a 9.7% yoy growth in revenue during the quarter as compared to our estimate of 10.3% yoy. Similarly, our coverage companies reported an 8.9% yoy revenue growth as against our estimate of a growth of 10.4% yoy. On a sequential basis, margin performance for Sensex companies improved by 40bp qoq (as against an estimated 6bp contraction) while it contracted by 13bp qoq for our coverage companies (as against an estimated 15bp contraction). Even on a yoy basis, margin contraction came in lower-than-anticipated at 53bp for Sensex companies (as against an estimated 110bp contraction) and 92bp for our coverage companies (as against an estimated 109bp contraction). Oil and gas, private banks and IT companies drive earnings growthAmongst our coverage universe, earnings performance was largely driven by oil and gas companies, new private banks and IT companies. Earnings for oil and gas companies came in better-than-expected at 36.4% yoy, largely aided by the performance of ONGC and RIL. New private banks reported a strong earnings growth of 28.5% yoy (estimated growth of 22.4% yoy) as they continued to face relatively lower asset quality pressures as compared to their PSU peers. IT companies reported a 17.4% yoy earnings growth, mainly led by better-than-expected revenue growth of large cap companies. Telecom, auto and metal companies largely weighed on earnings performance of our coverage universe. Stressed margins led telecom companies to report a 56.3% yoy contraction in earnings. Auto companies, weighed down by the performance of Tata Motors, posted a 26.8% yoy decline in earnings. Metal companies surprised negatively with a 21.8% yoy decline in earnings as revenues for ferrous players declined, and lower realizations dented margins. Sensex outlook and valuation: We expect the Sensex EPS to report a moderate 6.3% growth to Rs 1,195 in FY2013 and a more robust 16.1% growth to Rs 1,387 in FY2014. We maintain our 12-month Sensex target of 22,100, with a target multiple of 16x FY2014 earnings. Our target implies an upside of 14.4% from the present levels. We believe that with positive policy action, the medium-term growth outlook for the economy is gradually improving and there are possibilities for further upsides in the market arising out of improvement in the outlook for earnings growth and rollover to FY2015 earnings.

Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd (GSPC) wants to price gas that it will produce from Deen Dayal West (DDW) gas field in block KG-OSN-2001/3 by third quarter of 2013, at a minimum of USD 8.50 per million British thermal unit, excluding local taxes and margin.Also Read: Angel Broking neutral on Gujarat Gas GSPC, owned by the Gujarat government, will produce a maximum of 5.24 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the offshore DDW gas field. The gas will land at Mallavaram, near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, and can be ferried to customers up to Gujarat through Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd's East-West pipeline. The company in an advertisement issued in national and regional dailies invited bids from potential consumers at price formula at which Petronet LNG gets liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar on a long-term contract. GSPC sought 12.67 percent of the average Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. It asked users to quote a positive or negative number, termed as 'V', that can be added to this pricing formula. &amp;quot;Brent crude oil price will be capped at USD 110 per barrel and floor of the Brent crude oil price will be USD 65,&amp;quot; it said in the advertisement. Considering 'zero' as the value of the quotable component 'V', the DDW gas will cost about USD 14.2 per mmBtu at the cap price of USD 110. &amp;quot;Even if bid value of 'V' is negative, floor gas price will always be USD 8.50 per mmBtu,&amp;quot; GSPC said.  A year back, RIL had sought to price gas it will produce from below coal seams, called coal-bed methane (CBM), from its Sohagrpur blocks in Mahdyra Pradesh at 12.67 percent of the average price of crude oil imported into Japan (called Japan Crude Cocktail, or JCC) plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. Petronet pays RasGas of Qatar a price of 12.67 percent of JCC, besides incurring a USD 0.26 per mmBtu cost on transporting the gas in ships. Unlike GSPC, RIL did not set any floor or cap. At a USD 100 per barrel JCC average, CBM was to cost USD 12.67 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, totalling USD 12.93 per mmBtu. GSPC, which sought bids by March 12, said it will charge an additional marketing margin of Rs 10.21 per mmBtu while the consumer will also have to bear all taxes, duties, levies on sale of gas as well as transportation cost and duties and taxes thereon. RIL then extended this pricing formula for its eastern offshore KG-D6 gas when the current USD 4.205 per mmBtu rate expires in March 31, 2014. While the Oil Ministry has accepted a complex international hub-based pricing formula suggested by Rangarajan Committee for all gas produced in the country, GSPC said it as per Production Sharing Contract (PSC) provisions is seeking to discover gas price through competitive arms length basis. Price of gas as per Rangarajan panel recommendation would come to USD 8-8.5 per mmBtu. Great Eastern Energy Corp (GEECL) is selling CBM produced from its Raniganj block in West Bengal at USD 6.79 per mmBtu, while domestically produced natural gas is priced at USD 4.2to USD 5.73 per mmBtu. RIL had sought a marketing margin of USD 0.15 per mmBtu from CBM users, even though its USD 0.135 per mmBtu marketing margin charged on KG-D6 gas has been sent to oil regulator PNGRB for review. Sources said the Oil Ministry was reluctant to approve the price sought by RIL as nowhere in the world is domestic gas priced at LNG rates. RasGas of Qatar prices the 7.5 million tonnes a year (about 30 mmscmd) of gas it sells to Petronet LNG Ltd at 12.67 percent of JCC. Another USD 0.26 per mmBtu is the cost it takes for shipping the gas cooled to turn it into liquid (called LNG) in cryogenic ships. RIL adopted this formula and has sought pricing of its CBM as well as KG-D6 gas in line with it. Now, GSPC too has adopted the formula and has changed JCC with widely quoted Brent crude oil."

RIL provided half of the documents to the team of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) during their three-week stay at the company's office at Mumbai beginning January 9 and wrote to it that the rest, barring a small 10 per cent, would be given when the auditor promised to return on February 11. Sources privy to the development said CAG, however, wrote back saying it will not be coming as promised on February 11. In the meantime, CAG Vinod Rai wrote to Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily that RIL is not cooperating with the audit. The documents that RIL has declined to provide relate to its legal case against the Oil Ministry decision to decline USD 1 billion of cost recovery as punishment for gas output from the main gas fields in KG-D6 block not matching the target. RIL reasoned that such documents are no way related to audit of spending and revealing its strategy to counter the Ministry will compromise its legal case, sources said. Also, RIL has refused to provide any documents relating to selection of technology as it felt the auditor cannot sit on judgement using hindsight to question decisions taken 6-7 years ago. Sources said the firm feels the auditor's job is to verify expenditure and not question technology selection, which can be done only in a propriety audit and such an audit was beyond the scope provided in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for KG-D6. RIL, they said, has kept the Oil Ministry, on whose written assurance that CAG would follow the audit process set out in the PSC, posted of the developments through weekly updates. RIL on January 29 wrote to the Ministry that CAG was seeking voluminous documents of years not related to the period under audit (2008-09 to 2011-12). CAG is demanding documents of previous years even though it had taken copies of documents in the first round of audit."

Natural Gas production from KG-D6 block has dropped to below 20 million standard cubic metres a day this week, from over 63 mmscmd peak output achieved in August 2010. The available gas is first supplied to fertiliser plants and LPG units and whatever little fuel is left is supplied to 25 power plants on pro-rata basis. From the current production only 1 mmscmd of gas is being supplied to power plants, forcing many units to work at sub-optimal levels. To overcome this, the Oil Ministry has proposed to roster gas supplies, official sources said. Under this scheme, gas will be supplied to power plants on rotation basis. Plants will get fuel supplies needed for operating the unit atoptimal capacity for a fixed period turn-by-turn. Also read: Have almost sorted out FSA issues with Coal India: NTPC &amp;quot;Due to shortage in availability of domestic gas many power plants are operating at low plant-load factor (PLF) leading to inefficient usage of natural gas and lower production of electricity,&amp;quot; the Ministry's draft guidelines for rostering of gas said. The Ministry has sought comments on the rostering guidelines from stakeholders by February 28. The rostering can be done only within a group of power plants under a single discom, the guideline said. &amp;quot;On a monthly basis, the overall gas supply from each gas source to a power plant shall be same in energy terms as it would have been without rostering.&amp;quot; Sources said the Ministry, to begin with, wants to apply the scheme to six private power plants in Andhra Pradesh. The acute shortage in availability of domestic gas for the power sector has lead to many of power plants operating at much less than the minimum required PLF. The Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal have seen output fall from a plateau level of about 55 mmscmd in August 2010 to about 15 mmscmd currently. MA oil field in the same block is currently producing just over 4 mmscmd. Of the present production, about 15 mmscmd is supplied to fertiliser plants and 3.12 mmscmd gas goes to LPG extraction plant and the gas transportation pipeline's internal consumption. A little under 1 mmscmd of gas is split between 25 power plants."

The expert appraisal committee (EAC) under the ministry had earlier rejected the group's proposal to use diesel as an alternate fuel at the plant, and advised it to approach the ministry of petroleum for its views on the matter.  The panel, whose nod is required for any change in fuel use at power plants, changed its decision in the light of the oil ministry's move last month to abolish subsidy for bulk diesel purchasers. GVK is operating a 390 MW (expansion phase-II) gas-based power project at Jequrupadu near Krishna-Godavari basin in East Godavari district. &amp;quot;In view of the information provided...the Committee finally recommended that HSD (high speed diesel) may be permitted as top up fuel only till 100 per cent natural gas supply is available,&amp;quot; the EAC said recently after going through&amp;amp;nbsp; documents provided by GVK. GVK told the panel that gas supply from Reliance Industries had been declining and the current supply was about 0.5 MMSCMD instead of 1.1 MMSCMD required. As a consequence, the plant is operating at just 47 percent plant load factor. Due to continuous reduction in gas supply, energy dissemination to the grid has gone down. Hence, to meet the power demand of the grid, it is envisaged to use liquid fuel (HSD) instead of naphtha, GVK informed the EAC. The company had said use of HSD will be an interim arrangement till full natural gas supply is made available. The EAC had in 2012 rejected the proposal on the grounds that the HSD is a subsidised product and hence cannot be used for commercial purposes. However, the decontrol of diesel for bulk buyers paved the way for the gas-starved company to go for HSD as an alternate fuel to run the project. GVK has also obtained the oil ministry's NoC to use diesel. EAC observed that the government order prescribes that power producers using HSD could source their requirement of diesel from oil firms at mutually agreed terms and conditions. It asked GVK to institute a study on radiation due to release of mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the plant. "

The Ministry, which had been sitting on the proposal for over a year, issued formal orders a few days ago permiting exploration in already producing oil and gas fields to help companies augment existing production. &amp;quot;Government of India has decided that exploration will be allowed in mining lease area with cost recovery on establishment of commerciality,&amp;quot; the order said. All approved exploration costs will be allowed for cost recovery on such declaration of commerciality, it said. &amp;quot;The contractor will also be permitted to develop and monetise the existing discoveries, if any, in the Mining Lease area (or oil and gas producing region) which could not be developed or monetised earlier because some of the activities may have been in deviation from Production Sharing Contract (PSC) provisions,&amp;quot; it said. After this, companies can drill exploration wells within an oil and gas field, but with the condition that cost recovery of such wells would be allowed only in case there is a commercially exploitable discovery. This essentially means that cost of drilling any well that does not lead to a discovery, or a small find that could not be independently produced, will not be allowed. Currently, when a company finds oil or gas in an area, the discovery area is ring-fenced and a mining lease is granted for production of hydrocarbons. Operators get to recover all their cost -- whether successful or failed wells, from the oil and gas produced and sold from that particular block. The order said past exploration cost in a development area will not be allowed to recover. It said &amp;quot;any future costs for appraisal, development and production of all such existing discoveries under the new ring-fencing arrangements&amp;quot; will be allowed to be recovered. The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had previously taken a view that further exploration within this ring-fenced mining lease area is not permitted. It felt the government's profit share, which is triggered when an explorer recovers all his cost, would be adversely impacted if new costs are added. RIL and Cairn have maintained that exploration being a continuous process is allowed in the mining lease under which they currently produce gas from eastern offshore and Rajasthan blocks, respectively.

The Finance Ministry wants auto fuel to be priced at export parity by abolishing 2.5 per cent customs duty on petrol and diesel to save up to Rs 18,000 crore in annual subsidy outgo. The Petroleum Federation of India (Petrofed), an apex body of entities in hydrocarbon sector, on January 28 wrote to Finance Minister P Chidambaram saying removing duty protection on products would render &amp;quot;some inland refineries sick&amp;quot; while private refiners like Reliance Industries and Essar Oil may resort to exporting their full production. Budget 2013: Mkt to consolidate; avoid infra, bet oil says IIFL There is no import duty on crude oil and if the same on petrol and diesel is also abolished, there were be no duty protection left to the refineries who included the element of customs duty in pricing of the product to make up for freight, Central Sales Tax (CST) and other charges. &amp;quot;While a change from trade parity pricing to export parity pricing may benefit fiscal management of the government in short term by lowering its subsidy burden but it would render a serious blow to the domestic refineries,&amp;quot; it wrote. It said domestic refineries were removed from the cost plus mechanism on April 1, 1998 and pay the price of feed-stock crude oil on import parity basis. Indigenous crude oil is also paid for the refineries on import parity basis. India imports nearly 80 per cent of its crude oil requirements. Foreign investors put in Rs 1,800cr for OIL stake sale &amp;quot;When the primary raw material is on import parity basis, the FOB export parity pricing for products would clearly be extremely unfair to the refineries,&amp;quot; it said. Making out a case against export parity pricing, Petrofed said Indian refiners ar subjected to a freight cost on crude oil vis-a-vis West Asian refineries which is at least USD 05-0.8 per barrel. In addition, energy costs are higher since energy equivalent to 7 to 8 per cent of throughput is consumed in processing and has to be met by either crude oil based products of imported liquid gas (LNG) whereas the west Asian refineries met such energy needs from surplus gas. Besides, Indian refineries incur heavy demurrage on import of crude oil due to constraints in infrastructure at Indian ports and also pay VAT/CST at the rate of 2 to 5 per cent on purchase of crude oil from domestic producers which is not a pass through. It said for additional resources, the governmnt can consider raising excise duties which are a direct pass through.  Oil Min to go to Cabinet on gas pricing: Moily &amp;quot;The older refineries of PSUs may not be able to cover the cost of refining operations and will be further strained with lack of capital so vitally required for capacity addition or product quality upgradation,&amp;quot; Petrofed said adding refining industry was passing through a downward margin cycle that may result in some inland refineries becoming sick. Private refineries may resort to exporting their full production unless compensated for CST/coastal freight. Petrofed said India's refining capacity has grown from a modest 62 million tons per annum in 1998 to over 215 million tons and is expected to grow to over 310 million tons by the end of 12th Five Year Plan. Private sector has invested over USD 25 billion in the refining industry. &amp;quot;Customs duty on crude has progressively been reduced from 15 per cent to zero and that on petrol and diesel has gone down from 25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. There is nil duty protection on products like LPG, kerosene, ATF, naphtha and FO/LSHS for fertilisers,&amp;quot; it said. C Rangarajan in his report on 'Pricing and Taxation of Petroleum Products' in 2006 had made out a case for some effective protection to domestic refineries as the business was cyclical in natural characterised by very volatile prices. Also, the spread between crude (raw material) and products prices fluctuates widely and there have been instances when diesel prices had lower than crude."

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) can, however, get the new rates this year itself for gas they produce from fields given to them on nomination basis by the government. Gas from nominated fields, called APM gas, is currently priced at USD 4.2 per mmBtu. The Rangarajan panel suggested rates may also not apply to BG Group-operated Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields in the western offshore as the current rates of USD 5.57-5.73 per mmBtu for the fuel produced from these are derived from a pre-defined formula detailed in the PSC. However, Cairn India's eastern offshore Ravva gas, which is currently priced at USD 3.5-4.3 per mmBtu, may be revised as per the committee's recommendations. Sources said the Rangarajan panel had suggested taking a weighted average of the US, Europe and Japanese gas hubs or market price and then averaging it with the net imported price of liquid gas (LNG) to give sale price of domestically produced gas.

The CCI in its meeting on Wednesday asked the Ministry of Defence and Moily's ministry to sort out differences over the seven block in one month and for the 32 areas in three months. &amp;quot;I dont think there will be a problem. We will sort it out. This (defence clearance to the 39 blocks) will open up Rs 80,000 crore of investment (and) open up a big gateway of investment in petroleum sector,&amp;quot; he said. Moily said oil and gas exploration and defence activities can co-exist as was the practice in several countries, including the United States. No threat of work stopping at KG-D6 gas fields: RIL &amp;quot;They (Defence Ministry) have a concern, which we are also concerned about. National security is important (but) at the same time oil and gas exploration and development is also necessary,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;When countries are after countries are going ahead, why can't India.&amp;quot; Moily said more than USD 14-15 billion investment has already been made in blocks like KG-D6 which has been producing oil since September 2008 and natural gas since April 2009. &amp;quot;Enough technology is available where exploration can co-exist with defence strategies,&amp;quot; he said, adding oil and gas production does not require thousands of kilometres of area. While companies are allotted large areas for finding hydrocarbons, actual area used for production is only 4-5 per cent and the rest of it is relinquished, he said."

So far, it has raised USD 4 billion from overseas in the current financial year. &amp;quot;The company is planning to raise at least USD 500 million by issuing perpetual bonds. The issue hit the markets today and the final amount will depend on the investor appetite. The initial pricing is 6 per cent over the UStreasury,&amp;quot; an RIL official who did not wish to be named told PTI. RIL plans Jamnagar unit maintenance first week of Feb Perpetual bonds are those with no maturity date, therefore, it may be treated as equity, not as debt. Perpetual bonds pay coupons forever and the issuer does not have to redeem them. Their cash flows are, therefore, those of aperpetuity. However, he expressed hope that the final pricing will be much below the guidance because of the strong fundamentals of the company. When asked why it is raising debt despite sitting on over Rs 75,000 crore surplus cash, the official said, the interest rates are at historical lows and hence it's a good time for Reliance to raise long term money and that the longterm nature of the bond is in line with the long term assets of the company. He further said bank of America, Citi, HSBC, Barclays Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and RBS are mandated for the issue. The RIL official also said this first senior long-rated bond issuance by a domestic company. The funds will be used to meet the capex requirements of the company that runs the world's largest refinery at Jamnagar. The senior unsecured perpetual notes have 'BBB' rating from S&amp;amp;amp;P, the rating said in a note.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;quot;The proposed notes will rank equally with all the company's other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations,&amp;quot; S&amp;amp;amp;P said in a note from Singapore. &amp;quot;The rating on Reliance reflects the company's strong competitive position and good business diversity. In addition, RIL has low leverage, and strong cash flows and liquidity,&amp;quot; S&amp;amp;amp;P said, adding the positive rating outlook reflects our view that the company has a large cash surplus to protect its financial strength against any potential deterioration in operating conditions. This bond represents the first senior long dated/perpetual issuance by a domestic issuer after Tata Power's recent hybrid, RIL official said, adding only a only a select few Asian issuers have been able to access this market.The transaction extends Reliance's maturity profile and establishes Reliance's credit curve in 10-year, 30-year and perpetual bonds, the official added. Stating the final pricing will be really tight he said the recent issuances from MNCs like Prudential Plc had 5.25 per cent, Telekom Austria at 5.875 per cent, Banco Do Brasil's at 6.25 per cent and Axa's a 5.50 per cent among others."

At the CMP of Rs 923, RIL trades at a PE multiple of 13.4x and 11.9x FY14E &amp;amp;amp; FY15E and we recommend a long term buy on the stock.&rdquo; &amp;amp;nbsp;&ldquo;For Q3FY13, Reliance Industries registered a 2.3% qoq and 23.9% yoy growth in net profit to Rs 5502 crore driven largely by higher refining EBIT and other income. The net sales too met expectations and grew by 10.3% yoy to Rs 93,886 crore, primarily led by the higher volumes and rupee depreciation. Performance of Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing business improved sequentially led by higher throughput and 3.3% qoq jump in GRMs which stood at &amp;amp;#36;9.6/bbl v/s &amp;amp;#36; 9.5/bbl in the previous quarter. Performance of the E&amp;amp;amp;P business is easing backed by the recently received approvals. The company has reported GRMs at &amp;amp;#36;9.6/bbl in Q3FY13 as against &amp;amp;#36;6.8/bbl in Q3FY12 and &amp;amp;#36;9.5/bbl in Q2FY13. The key trigger to drive this growth is better gasoline and naphtha crack spread. Weak fuel oil spreads had caused material fall in Singapore GRMs. Nonetheless, RIL having significantly lower proportion of Fuel Oil in its product slate was less impacted. The pet coke gasification plant is on track and would take 3 years to come on stream. Despite volume being flat in Q3FY13, petrochemical segment revenues rose by 11.5% yoy and realizations were higher by 11% yoy as prices for most products have increased in line with rising crude oil prices and steep rupee depreciation. On a sequential basis, volumes were marginally low and realizations remained flat. EBIT margins for the segment de-grew by 212bps on a YoY (+90bps QoQ). The sequential increase was owing to improvement in PP, PX and MEG spreads. Overall polyester chain also saw improvement on a sequential basis. The demand growth for all products remained strong across the categories in India.&rdquo; &amp;amp;nbsp;&ldquo;The E&amp;amp;amp;P business has seen reversal in news flow over the last few months, with a slew of approvals coming through for RIL&rsquo;s development plans and budgets for D6. Over the last few months, the company has received approvals for appraisal of CY-D6, drilling of KG-D6 development well G2 (OFDP), work program budget for KG-D6. However, KG-D6 gas production continued to decline (-41% yoy,-16% qoq) in Q3 FY13. Gas production at the Panna-Mukta field was higher by 2.8% yoy, whereas oil production was down by 16% yoy in Q3FY13. Gas production at the Tapti field also declined by 40% yoy over the same quarter. Lower volumes 32.2% yoy and 14.8% qoq, translated into a slump in revenues. EBIT margins for the segment plunged by 15% yoy and 7.7% qoq to 30.7% owing to operational de-leverage. Going ahead, the company has planned to arrest the decline in production but awaits key approvals from the government including budget approvals for capital expenditure.

The Ministry in a draft Cabinet note proposed accepting in toto the Rangarajan Committee recommendation of pricing domestically produced natural gas at an average of international hub prices and cost of imported LNG instead of present mechanism of market discovery. Sources said ministry wants the pricing formula proposed by the panel to apply to all forms of natural gas - conventional, shale and coal-bed methane (CBM). Also, the price determined shall be applicable to all consuming sectors uniformly. OilMin prepares to take Rangarajan report to CCEA: Sources It, they said, wanted the new pricing guidelines to apply from 2013 itself on all domestically produced gas barring cases where it is either governed by a definite formula prescribed in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) or the government had previously fixed a tenure for the same. This essentially meant that RIL would get the new price only from April 1, 2014 upon expiry of the fixed five-year term of current rate of USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) can, however, get the new rates this year itself for gas they produce from fields given to them on nomination basis by the government. Gas from nominated fields, called APM gas, is currently priced at USD 4.2 per mmBtu. RIL gas output falls to all time low The Rangarajan panel suggested rates may also not apply to BG Group-operated Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields in the western offshore as the current rates of USD 5.57-5.73 per mmBtu for the fuel produced from these are derived from a pre-defined formula detailed in the PSC. RIL, ONGC can see smart rally: Harchekar However, Cairn India's eastern offshore Ravva gas, which is currently priced at USD 3.5-4.3 per mmBtu, may be revised as per the committee recommendations. Sources said the ministry said the Rangarajan panel report needs to be accepted so that domestically produced natural gas prices are fixed in a fair manner and in a way that incentivises production. The panel had suggested taking a weighted average of the US, Europe and Japanese gas hubs or market price and then averaging it with the net imported price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to give sale price of domestically produced gas.  Taking last year's publicly available consumption numbers and the prevailing price of gas in the three markets, the formula suggested by the Rangarajan committee gives USD 8-8.5 per mmBtu as the price of domestic gas.  RIL, which had been engaged in protracted wrangling with the Oil Ministry on pricing of natural gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 field, last week said there was &amp;quot;positive traction in domestic exploration and production business environment with the submission of Rangarajan Committee Report&amp;quot;. The panel had addressed key issues on &amp;quot;gas price mechanism&amp;quot; and created &amp;quot;an investment enabling environment&amp;quot;, RIL said in investor presentation on its October-December quarter results. RIL has since been seeking a price of almost USD 13 per mmBtu for gas produced from KG-D6 gas on expiry of current USD 4.2 per mmBtu price in April next year and its comments on Rangarajan Committee recommendation are being seen as its readiness to accept a lower price. The company, which had previously stated that USD 4.2 was too low for monetising smaller and marginal gas finds in KG-D6 and other blocks, said the Rangarajan panel recommendation &amp;quot;indicates positive sign for monetisation of marginal fields&amp;quot;. The Rangarajan Committee suggested averaging volume-weighted price of gas at US's Henry Hub, UK's NBP and Japan Customs Cleared prices for the trailing 12 months with the the net price that producer got from exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India on a long-term contract. Previously, RIL had from April 2014 wanted to price KG-D6 gas at the rate India pays for importing gas in its liquid form (called LNG) on a long-term contract from Qatar. India pays 12.67 per cent of the international oil rate plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu to Qatar. At USD 100 per barrel oil rate, this translated into a gas price of USD 12.93. The panel headed by C Rangarajan -- Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister -- also suggested gas-on-gas competition after five years and sweeping change in future exploration contracts. The existing PSC allows a company to recover its cost, before giving the government a share in revenue earned from sale of oil and gas. Stating that cost recovery is at the root of the problems being experienced currently, the panel proposed to dispense with it in favour of sharing of the overall revenues of the contractor, without setting off any costs. The committee has also recommended that an extended tax holiday of 10 years, as against 7 years already available for all blocks, be granted for blocks having a substantial portion involving drilling offshore at a depth of more than 1,500 metres, since cost of a single well can be as high as USD 150 million."

Stating that LNG terminals were running at full capacity at USD 15 per mmBtu price, it said sizable demand for gas existed above USD 10 per mmBtu driven by high liquid fuel prices (USD 20) combined with convenience of gas usage.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Listing key challenges, it said &amp;quot;timely approvals&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;implementation of pricing recommendation in line with the PSC provisions.&amp;quot; RIL said natural gas production from KG-D6 field fell 41 per cent in October-December quarter to 78 billion cubic feet from 133 bcf in the same period a year ago.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The company has shut more than one-third of the wells due to high water and sand ingress.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; It has begun drilling of the first well on a satellite field in the block and has begun work on for upgradation of booster and other facilities which would address the decline in reservoir pressure and enhance the recovery."

Net profit up by 23.9% YoY to Rs.55bn on back of higher refining and petchem margins. Gross refining margins (GRMs) stand at &amp;amp;#36;9.6/bbl, flat QoQ, better than our/street expectations of US&amp;amp;#36;9/8.7/bbl. Petchem EBIT surprise positively at Rs.19.3bn, up 11% QoQ, due to better margins. KG D6 production at 24mmscmd, continued its declining trend, down 15% QoQ. Recent spate of E&amp;amp;amp;P approvals augur well for company but still time for results to show up. Refining EBIDTA at Rs.45bn were better than our /street expectations mainly on the back of better GRMs. Sequentially GRMs remained flat at &amp;amp;#36;9.6/bbl, as against our and street expectations of &amp;amp;#36;9/bbl / &amp;amp;#36;8.7/bbl. Refining EBIT grew 2.6% QoQ to Rs 36.1bn. Although the benchmark Singapore refining margins declined in Q3FY13 averaging. At US&amp;amp;#36;7/bbl as against US&amp;amp;#36;9.3/bbl QoQ. This is on account of sharp decline in fuel oil spreads to US&amp;amp;#36;(18)/bbl (US&amp;amp;#36;12/bbl QoQ) which forms higher proportion of Singapore GRM product slate and better LPG/Naphtha spreads which form higher proportion of RIL&rsquo;s product slate. Also increase in spread between light-heavy crude oil by US&amp;amp;#36;1.5/bbl to US&amp;amp;#36;4/bbl has helped RIL GRMs for the quarter. Refinery throughput for Dec12Qtr stood at 17.5mntons flat QoQ. We revise our consolidated earnings estimate for FY13 to take into account better than expected Q3FY13 performance and performance of shale business. We also assume GRMs of US&amp;amp;#36;9/bbl for 4QFY13 as against US&amp;amp;#36;8.5/bbl earlier. Increase our EPS by 7.2% from Rs.63.2 to Rs.67.8 for FY13E. Our FY14E EPS changes by 5% to Rs.68.3 on account of shale business and higher GRM assumption at US&amp;amp;#36;8.7/bbl as against US&amp;amp;#36;8.5/bbl earlier. We introduce FY15E earnings with expected EPS of Rs.72.1. YoY increase in earning of 5.5% is on account of start of petchem capacities and increased contribution from shale gas business. While FY15 would be the full year for PFY/PTY/PET capacities to contribute to earnings, PX/PTA/MEG capacities are expected to start in 2HFY15. While the concerns on declining gas production in KG basin have remained, RIL stock has moved up by 11% and out performed broader market by about 4% in the last 3 months. While the better performance during the quarter has come from both the core businesses of refining and petchem it&rsquo;s too early to expect a sustained recovery in margins. We maintain our outlook of weak refining cycle going ahead on the back of higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. Structurally, refining cycle is expected to remain weak with incremental net refining capacity additions expected to the tune of 1mbpd/1.3mbpd in 2012 / 2013, as against demand growth of 0.8mbpd / 1mbpd. In case of petchem, demand remains a concern and any weakness in demand could impact any sustained recovery in margins. Gas production from KG basin is expected to decline further and is not expected to reverse the trend before FY15. Positive government stance towards RIL&rsquo;s E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts augurs well for the company but its still time before results come up. We factor in average gas production of 20/18mmscmd for FY14/15. We remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of new capacities and/or weakening demand.

Read This: Reliance Industries may go up to Rs 920-925, says Harchekar The company's exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) earnings will continue to decline in short-to-medium term, but for the first time, the management sounded positive on KG-D6 prospects after getting permission to drill additional wells in the basin.  The top brass is also hopeful that the C Rangarajan Committee's proposal of scrapping current practice of administered price mechanism and linking domestic gas price to international prices will pave way for better pricing in future. Brokerage firm Nomura believes after the Rangarajan Committee has started looking into the key issues of gas pricing, hence business environment in E&amp;amp;amp;P segment has started improving. &amp;quot;Though RIL does not fully agree&amp;amp;nbsp;to sell gas at&amp;amp;nbsp;USD 7-8/mmbtu (million metric British thermal units) &amp;amp;nbsp;which is lower than its expectation of USD 10-14/mmbtu, it believes the suggestion could pave way for finalising better pricing, going ahead,&amp;quot; &amp;amp;nbsp;states Nomura's Ravi Adukia and Anil Sharma in a review note. Along with E&amp;amp;amp;P business scenario showing signs of improvement, the Rs 1,200 crore expansion plan in petchem segment is also on track which will boost capacity in FY14. After taking into account these factors, the firm has assigned&amp;amp;nbsp; 'buy' on the stock with a target price of Rs 1000. Axis Capital also believes that the company will push for higher gas prices to recover its cost on the KG-DG project which may eventually happen. It has a positive outlook overall and hence has assigned&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;'hold' rating with a target price of Rs 950. HSBC states though RIL has started drilling more wells in D6, it will take atleast four years for it to start production from them and the current decline from existing well will continue impacting overall performance. Hence, it is 'underweight' on the stock with a target price of Rs 800. Jefferies states that despite the management sounding optimistic over recent regulatory developments in the&amp;amp;nbsp;sector, production recovery in KG-D6 is unlikely before FY16.&amp;amp;nbsp; It further says that RIL will not be able to extend its Rs 10,000-crore buyback plan which investors were earlier betting on. After taking into account these factors, the firm has also assigned&amp;amp;nbsp; 'hold' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 820.&amp;amp;nbsp;"

The share buyback programme, the largest-ever by an Indian company, concluded yesterday, but the final figure might change as the data has been disclosed on the stock exchanges only for shares bought back till January 16.  Billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) began the buyback programme on February 7, 2012 with a target to repurchase shares worth about Rs 10,440 crore from the public shareholders. The company had offered to buyback the shares at a price of up to Rs 870 each under the programme.  The company said in a notification that the buyback of equity shares, as approved by its board of directors on January 20 last year, closed on January 19, 2013, but did not disclose the final tally.  According to data available with the stock exchanges, RIL bought back about 4.62 crore shares, estimated to be worth Rs 3,951 crore, till January 16.  The buyback programme had begun on a slow pace, but gained some momentum in May 2012, when the stock price fell below Rs 700.  The programme was announced with an aim to shore up the value of RIL shares, which had underperformed the markets in 2011. However, The stock have gained nearly 15 per cent in the past one year, but it is still lower than the gains registered by the market benchmark index Sensex.  The stock is currently trading near Rs 900 level, which is much higher than the maximum price of Rs 870 per share fixed for the buyback.  Market analysts believe the purpose of the buyback was price stability and ensuring investor confidence in the stock, which the company has successfully achieved. According to CNI Research Head Kishor Ostwal, the success of buyback offers depends on many factors like willingness to buy the proposed shares and premium sustainability.  &amp;quot;In fact, many corporate houses failed to utilise the entire corpus targeted for the purpose in past and many firms even discontinued buying activities despite shares being available well below maximum buyback price,&amp;quot; he added.

Ebit margins however declined to 8.8% from 10.9%,YoY due to higher base price effect. Exploration and production:&amp;amp;nbsp; Revenues plunged 32.2% to Rs 1921 crore due to the consistent decline in KG-DG output which declined to around 25 mmscmd during the quarter.

KG-D6 output will continue to be a dampener with production slipping around 29% to 24 million cubic meters a day (mmscmd) due to water ingress and other technical issues.  Petchem segment may spring a surprise on good volumes and higher base price effect. This is what brokerages expect of RIL in Q3 Angel Broking expects the company to post a net profit of Rs 5,108 crore and revenues to be around Rs 89,981 crore. Bhavesh Chauhan, sector analyst from the firm says, &amp;quot;Though RIL is expected to post GRMs at USD 8.5/bbl, it may surprise the market by posting better-than-expected margins similar to Essar Oil which also recorded better GRMs at USD 9.5/bbl in Q3.&amp;quot; &amp;amp;nbsp;He further said, higher other income will boost topline, partly offsetting poor show from exploration and production segment. Giving a segment wise break-up on earnings, Nomura says the company's E&amp;amp;amp;P segment will see its EBIT decline 7% (YoY) to Rs 800 crore on poor volumes, refining segment earnings too will dip nearly 17% to Rs 2940 crore due to sharp volatility in business environment. However, petchem division will grow 4% to Rs 1810 crore. Prabhudas Lilladher states, despite a sharp sequential decline in Singapore GRMs to USD 6.5/bbl during the quarter, RIL's refining margins may come in at around USD 9.5/bbl, outperforming the benchmark. The firm expects the company&rsquo;s E&amp;amp;amp;P and petchem biz to remain subdued and hence profit will dip 7% to Rs 5010 crore, QoQ. Barclays also expects a tepid quarter for RIL after taking into account flat refining margins and weaker gas volumes which will partly offset gains petchem division gains. &amp;quot;Earnings may remain muted for the ensuing six quarters before the company hikes gas price to USD 9.60/mmbtu after April 2014,&amp;quot; it says.

According to the research firm, one can buy Reliance Industries February futures in the range of Rs 865-875 and sell Nifty February futures in the range of 6105-6125. Reliance has witnessed the highest concentration of Put options at 840 strike since the inception of the January series. The open interest levels observed closure along with positive move in the stock clearly indicating strong support available for the stock at lower levels. At the same time, with the recent up move, short covering is visible at the OTM 880 and 900 Call strikes, which is likely to augur well with stock upsides. The stock witnessed closure of 20% positions in the recent up move from 820 to 860 levels. Traders had formed positional shorts in the stock in the last couple of years, which they were rolling from series to series. We believe these shorts are stuck up, which is shown in 20% OI closure recently. Hence, this trend is likely to continue and would provide strength to the stock on declines. The stock has been witnessing consolidation since December and the VWAP levels of Reliance are placed at 841 levels. Strong accumulation at 840 Put also bodes well with the argument of strong support at 840 levels. Moreover, noteworthy delivery volumes were seen during last month around these levels. Hence, we expect 840 to remain good support on declines. Due to prevailing consolidation seen in the&amp;amp;nbsp; broader market, stock specific movement may continue. Since Reliance has been unable to perform in line with the index since 2010, we expect the stock to witness fresh upsides and, in turn, outperform the index. The current price ratio (Nifty/Reliance) has reverted from the 50% retracement of the downtrend seen since 2004 to 2009. We believe the price ratio of 7.26 will act as a stiff resistance and it may witness some downtrend in favour of the strategy.

This is the lowest level of holding in RIL shares for this class of investors, especially retail ones, since June 2009. Analysts said institutions could be betting on turnaround in RIL shares that have remained mostly range-bound between Rs 700-900 apiece for many months now, even as the benchmark indices are fast approaching their record high levels. During the last quarter ended December 31, 2012, the country's biggest institutional investor and state-run insurer LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) hiked its stake in RIL to almost 8 per cent with purchase of shares worth an estimated Rs 808 crore. During the same period, FIIs cumulatively bought shares worth Rs 200 crore to up their stake in RIL to 17.79 per cent as on December 31, 2012. Other major institutional shareholders in the company include Franklin Templeton (1.26 per cent) and Government of Singapore (1.23 per cent). Promoters have a 45.34 per cent stake in RIL, while insurance companies control 8.79 per cent and mutual funds 1.88 per cent in the company."

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had sought to settle certain investigations into alleged violation of insider trading norms in sale of shares of its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd, but the application to settle of the matter under Sebi's consent framework was rejected by the regulator. Consequently, RIL filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), which had listed the matter for hearing. Sebi, however, sought more time from SAT to study the RIL petition, pursuant to which the Tribunal today adjourned the matter till January 24 for further hearing. RIL's appeal against the Securities and Exchange Board of India was earlier scheduled to heard by SAT for admission on January 4, but it had adjourned the hearing to January 11. RIL is believed to have challenged Sebi's decision to reject its application and also the changes made by Sebi in the regulations governing settlement of cases through consent mechanism -- especially for cases already under consideration. Under Sebi's consent mechanism, companies can seek to settle cases with the market regulator after payment of certain charges and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. In May 2012, Sebi tightened the regulations for settlement through consent framework, as a result of which many cases including those related to insider trading, cannot be settled through this mechanism. On January 3, Sebi published a list of 149 consent pleas, including 16 from entities related to RIL group, which it had found unsuitable for settlement through consent process. These include applications of RIL itself and that of Group Chairman Mukesh Ambani's close aide Manoj Modi. These include 13 applications from various entities in a case involving alleged violation of Sebi regulations for 'Prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trade practices' in a matter of RIL's erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd. Besides, there are three applications related to alleged violation of 'Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations' in the matter of another erstwhile RIL group company - Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL) - which used to be a government-owned company and was later acquired by Mukesh Ambani-led group as part of a disinvestment exercise. Both the companies, Reliance Petroleum and IPCL, used to be separately listed entities, but were later acquired by RIL and got delisted from the stock exchanges.

According to the research firm, supply-side pressures is expected to weigh on crude in FY14, providing the much needed respite for upstream companies from current levels of high under-recoveries and adverse subsidy-sharing scenario. Crude oil prices traded in the narrow range during the quarter, with Brent oil prices averaging at US&amp;amp;#36;110.4/bbl during the quarter. Under-recoveries continues to run high, with quarterly under-recovery estimate of Rs387bn and full year expected at ~Rs1,620bn (Rs1,350bn in FY12). The retreat in refining margins that started in Oct 2FN has continued through the quarter, as more refineries have returned from turnarounds. Singapore refining margins have seen a sharp fall, averaging ~US&amp;amp;#36;6.6/bbl in the current quarter compared to US&amp;amp;#36;9.15/bbl in Q2FY13. India destination LNG prices increased during the quarter to average ~US&amp;amp;#36;12.5/mmbtu, increase in the prices is largely on account of winter season. Crude - prices were range bound (US&amp;amp;#36;105/bbl-US&amp;amp;#36;112/bbl), averaged at US&amp;amp;#36;110.4/bbl in Q3FY13 Brent has continued to hover around ~US&amp;amp;#36;110/bbl mark, on the back of 1) renewed demand concerns (Both IEA and EIA have cut demand forecasts by ~0.1mbpd in 2013) and improved non-OPEC supply outlook (IEA upped its forecast by ~0.15 mbpd) driven by better-than-anticipated output from US shale fields, 2) increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle east supporting prices. We expect supply-side pressures to weigh on crude in FY14, providing the much needed respite for upstream companies from current levels of high under-recoveries and adverse subsidy-sharing scenario. Although recent comments from the Saudi oil minister suggested that demand-supply conditions favour lower prices, a continued risk on environment on account of QE3 could continue to support prices.

Sources said companies like RIL have already invested USD 15 billion since 2000 and the ministry of defence has now withdrawn or withheld clearance to them. Of the 47 blocks, RIL's KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block falls in 14 areas which the ministry of defence has declared as &amp;quot;No-GO&amp;quot;. The reason for classifying the Krishna Godavari basin block, where UK's BP Plc has 30 per cent interest, as 'No-Go' area is that it overlaps with a proposed Naval base. KG-D6, which was awarded to RIL in 2000 by the Cabinet after clearance from all ministries concerned, had been producing oil since September 2008 and gas from April 1, 2009. RIL-BP's Mahanadi basin block NEC-OSN-97/2 where sizeable gas discoveries have been made, too has been classified as &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; area as it is close to missile launching range/air force exercise area. Sources said the other 12 &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; blocks are with state-owned ONGC, Cairn India and Australia's BHP Billiton and reasons cited for withdrawing clearance including being close to missile launching range, overlapping with proposed Naval base, overlapping with Naval firing range and Air Force exercise area.

CAG officials are scheduled to reach RIL's Navi Mumbai office on January 9 to begin the scrutiny, sources privy to the development said. The audit was initially scheduled to begin on January 2 but was deferred to January 9. It had agreed in May to do a second round of audit of spending in KG-D6 block for years 2008-09 to 2011-12 but that could not start due to differences over scope with RIL. RIL had insisted that government can appoint any auditor including CAG to do a financial audit of its spending in KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal but the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) does not allow a performance audit. CAG on the other hand believed that its constitutional mandate does not provide for any restrictions on the nature of audit. Sources said the Oil Ministry had given in writting to RIL that CAG audit will be strictly as per Section 1.9 of the Accounting Procedure to the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). Following this, RIL has agreed to cooperate and provide full access of its books of accounts to CAG. It has also dropped its contention that report of CAG be not made public. The PSC provides for a financial audit -- checking of the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits, but not a performance audit that scrutinises efficacies of processes or technology used in the complex deep sea operations. CAG has agreed for a financial audit of RIL's KG-D6 spendings and a performance audit if it has to be conducted will be done of the Petroleum Ministry and/or the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), sources said adding RIL will provide any document needed in doing such an audit. Sources however did not rule out more scrimmages. RIL, to be begin with, may refuse to provide documents related to the tendering process it followed for buying equipments or in selection of service providers, something which is unlikely to be acceptable to CAG, they said. The auditor may want to examine whether government's profit take from KG-D6 and its subsidy output on power and fertiliser increased on account of use of imported LNG due to KG-D6 output of just 20 million standard cubic meters per day not matching the projected profile of 80 mmscmd. CAG had in its first round of KG-D6 audit begun on the premise of doing a financial audit but the report tabled in Parliament last year stated that the auditor had conducted a performance audit.

Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas - During 3QFY2013, the price of Brent crude oil remained in the range of US&amp;amp;#36;108-117. Overall, average Brent crude oil was flattish during 3QFY2013. Further, the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil price also remained flat, broadly reflecting a flattish move in the price of Brent crude. Average Henry Hub natural gas price increased by 17.2% qoq after falling steeply over the past one year. Further, the Asian spot LNG price remained firm on account of demand-supply mismatch in Asia. Prices of petrochemical products, on the other hand, increased by 7.1% on a qoq basis during 3QFY2013. During September and October 2012, the Indian crude oil basket for oil prices stood at US&amp;amp;#36;112/bbl and US&amp;amp;#36;110/bbl, respectively. Rise in international crude oil prices coupled with INR depreciation against the USD resulted in higher under-recoveries for oil marketing companies (OMCs) on account of selling diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG at subsidized rates. During the first half of December 2012, OMCs continued to lose Rs 411cr per day. OMCs continued to lose Rs 9.3/liter, Rs 30.1/liter and Rs 521/cylinder on diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG, respectively. 3QFY2013 expectationsFor 3QFY2013, we expect mixed profitability performance for our coverage companies. For RIL, we expect the top-line to increase by 5.7% yoy on account of higher prices of petrochemicals. However, its operating profit is expected to decrease by 0.8% yoy mainly due to decline in production from the KG D6 block. Nevertheless, its PAT is expected to increase by 15.0% yoy mainly due to increase in other income. For ONGC, we expect net sales to increase by 6.5% yoy while its operating profit is expected to decrease by 10.1% yoy due to higher employees cost. GAIL is expected to report a top-line growth of 6.4% yoy on account of increase in volume. Its net profit is expected to increase by only 5.1% yoy due to higher top-line growth.

The Oil Ministry, which had been sitting on the proposal for over a year, wrote to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) earlier this week saying that it has been decided to permit exploration in already producing oil and gas fields, sources privy to the development said. Moily, who took over as the minister at the end of October, allowed companies to drill exploration wells within an oil and gas field, but with the condition that cost recovery of such wells would be allowed only in case there is a commercially exploitable discovery. This essentially means that cost of drilling any well that does not lead to a discovery or a small find that could not be independently produced, will not be allowed. Also Read: Oil companies gain on gas pricing reform hopes Currently, when a company finds oil or gas in an area, the discovery area is ring-fenced and a mining lease granted for production of hydrocarbons. Operators get to recover all their cost -- whether successful or failed wells, from the oil and gas produced and sold from that particular block. The DGH had previously taken a view that further exploration within this ring-fenced mining lease area is not permitted. It felt the government's profit share, which is triggered when an explorer recovers all his cost, would be adversely impacted if new costs are added. To overcome this, the ministry has put a condition that cost of the fresh exploration will be allowed to be recovered only when a new commercial discovery is made, sources said. &amp;quot;...cost recovery of such exploration being subject to establishment of commerciality of the new discovery..., mitigating any risk to the government revenue from existing discoveries,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote to DGH. &amp;quot;Cost recovery will be governed by current provisions of PSC on establishment of commerciality.&amp;quot; RIL and Cairn have maintained that exploration being a continuous process is allowed in the mining lease under which they currently produce gas from eastern offshore and Rajasthan blocks respectively. They felt the 'ring-fencing' proposed by DGH and seconded by the Oil Ministry was not practical and legal. While RIL has proposed to drill an exploration well on the flagging D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block to study reservoir characteristic, Cairn wants to drill new probes to help raise output from the Rajasthan block to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 175,000 bpd. Globally, exploration is permitted in fields that are under production so as to keep adding new reserves to replenish ones that have been produced. In absence of rejuvenation, the fields will terminally decline from the day output starts. The same has been followed in fields in Assam and Mumbai offshore."

Also read: RIL sells 2013 gasoil, jet fuel at high premiums A Reliance spokesman declined to comment on the SEBI announcement. The dispute with Reliance stems from SEBI's investigation into suspected insider trading when the energy conglomerate sold stock futures of Reliance Petroleum before folding the unit into its operations. Reliance Industries has denied engaging in any insider trading in that transaction. SEBI amended its procedures for so-called consent applications, or requests for out-of-court settlements, in May 2012, effectively banning the use of monetary payments to resolve suspected cases of market rule violations, including insider trading. The regulatory changes followed criticism that consent orders were being inappropriately used by those under investigation to avoid potentially more damaging rulings by the regulator on wrongdoing. Uncertainty had remained, however, over whether consent applications such as Reliance Industries' that were submitted before the rule change would be allowed to go ahead. Although the possibility of a settlement under the old consent applications has been removed, the regulator's brief statement said only that proceedings would continue in accordance with the law, offering no clues on how much longer the case might drag on.

While details of RIL's appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) could not be immediately obtained, Sebi has previously issued show-cause notices to the company in cases involving sale of shares of its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) and allotment of shares to certain firms against warrants linked to privately placed debentures issued by RIL. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has already replied to Sebi notices in these cases. In the case involving sale of shares of RPL, Sebi is said to have been investigating for a long time the alleged violation of insider trading regulations by RIL.  RPL used to be a separately-listed company, but it was later acquired by RIL and the merger process was also completed way back in 2009. RIL has previously sought to settle the case through Sebi's consent mechanism, which allows for settlement of cases without admission or denial of guilt after payment of certain charges and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, if any.  However, Sebi has rejected RIL's consent pleas on more than one occasion, terming the proposed payments as too less and on other grounds. As per the company's annual report for the fiscal year 2011-12, Sebi had issued it show-cause notices in connection with the sale of shares of erstwhile RPL and the allotment of RIL shares to certain companies against detachable warrants attached to privately placed debentures issued by it. &amp;quot;The company has submitted its reply to the same,&amp;quot; RIL had said in the annual report. RIL is currently buying back shares under a programmelaunched in February last year and has repurchased shares over Rs 3,800 crore from public shareholders since then -- achieving 37 per cent of the targetted amount of Rs 10,440 crore.

The order, it said, was issued considering the fact that many power plants in the country were operating at low Plant Load Factor (PLF) due to acute shortage in availability of domestic gas leading to inefficient production of electricity.

RIL's buyback would end on January 19, 2013. According to data available with the exchanges, Reliance Industries (RIL) which began a buyback programme of Rs. 10,440 crore early this year, has so far purchased shares worth Rs. 3,855 crore. This translates to about 37 per cent of the total targeted amount. Between February 14 and December 24, RIL has purchased 4.62 crore shares from the secondary market at an average price of Rs. 834 apiece. RIL's buyback programme had begun on a slow pace, but gained some momentum in May. The programme was announced with an aim to shore up the value of RIL shares, which have underperformed the markets last year and have been mostly trading on a sluggish note in the recent months as well. The stock is currently trading near Rs. 840 level, which is much below the maximum price of Rs. 870 per share fixed for the buyback. According to CNI Research Head Kishor Ostwal, the success of buyback offers depends on many factors like willingness to buy the proposed shares and premium sustainability. &amp;quot;In fact, many corporate houses failed to utilise the entire corpus targeted for the purpose in past and many firms even discontinued buying activities despite shares being available well below maximum buyback price,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;I do not think RIL would complete even 50 percent of the targeted amount and it would aggressively buyback shares in case the price falls drastically,&amp;quot; Ostwal said.

This is expected to rise to 466 mmscmd by the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan in 2016-17. The Plan document said there was a need for clarity on fiscal incentives on exploration of natural gas under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP). Currently, a seven-year holiday from payment of income tax is available only for crude oil produced from an area awarded under NELP. Natural gas produced from the same well does not attract any tax incentive. It called for according a'declared goods status' for natural gas/LNG so that it is available at uniform prices in most states. The Plan document called for eliminating &amp;quot;the uncertainty that has arisen regarding gas-pricing from NELP production-sharing contracts by implementing a new design of contracts&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The recommendation of the Rangarajan Committee may be an important input in finalising this policy,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Appropriate steps should be taken to resolve conflicts in existing contracts where the interpretation of the contract term is open to multiple options.&amp;quot;"

Mishra, an appellate authority in Central Information Commission(CIC), had on November 6 passed an order directing capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to disclose all details about the case on an appeal filed by RTI activist A K Agarwal. The case relates to the merger of Reliance Petroleum with Reliance Industries and the short sale of shares in the former by entities related to the latter. The merger between the two companies took place in 2009 and the company has been charged of indulging in insider trading. The CIC, acting on a petition filed by Agarwal, ordered SEBI on November 6 to disclose the details of investigation in the case or consent order proceedings. However, Sebi approached the high court challenging the CIC order. A division bench of D Y Chandrachud and Amjad Sayed today, while directing Reliance Industries to file its reply affidavit to the petition by January 21, said,&amp;quot;Wasn't Reliance bound to be heard by CIC before disclosure order was passed?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;If the disclosure pertains to a third party, in this case Reliance, then the third party should be heard before order is passed. They (Reliance) are entitled to it,&amp;quot; Justice Chandrachud said. Agarwal, however, told the court that as per section 8(2) of the RTI Act, if the information sought is in public interest, then it outweighs protection of the third party. &amp;quot;This is a case of insider trading worth Rs 500 crore. Penalty is up to Rs 1500 crore,&amp;quot; Agarwal argued. In its petition, Sebi said the order was passed by Mishra and not the CIC as a whole, makes it &amp;quot;bad in law&amp;quot; and therefore &amp;quot;null and void and of no effect&amp;quot;. Apart from Mishra, the CIC has seven other members. Reliance Ind has approached Sebi to settle the case through mechanism of consent process where an entity being investigated pays a fine without admitting fault and the regulator drops the case. "

The company said it has been selected for providing voice call and video technology by IBSL. &amp;quot;Reliance intends to invest USD 10 billion in its LTE (4G) network and has turned to SPIRIT's software products for voice and video calls over LTE instead of waiting for phone makers who are slow in offering handsets transmitting voice and video in 4G networks,&amp;quot; Spirit DSP said in a statement. IBSL is the only company in the country to have 20 Mhz of pan-India airwaves that it can use for providing 4G services. No immediate comments were available from RIL on Spirit DSP's statement. Spirit DSP said, through its solution, Reliance will be able to offer its subscribers high-quality services as an alternative to Skype - an application for making voice calls using internet connection, over cellular networks. At present, most of the people are able to make free calls using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application like Skype but in India such calls are allowed only between personal computers to personal computers. In October, IBSL has informed the Telecom Ministry that it is ready for trial runs of a technology that would enable voice calls service on its wireless broadband network and has sought allocation of number series to test its newly developed 'Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology. The telecom arm of RIL has told Ministry that it has developed a technology in preparation of a unified licensing regime recommended by the regulator TRAI under which consumers will be able to get voice, messaging and video using a single device. Sharing details of its plan, IBSL has said that VoLTE technology would enable it to work seamlessly with the existing 2G, 3G, NLD and ILD networks. It added that termination and receiving of calls from these networks to the IBSL network would be possible through the VoLTE technology."

The Ministry is contemplating asking Solicitor General Robinton Nariman for an opinion on if the contracts of RIL and Cairn or the mining lease given to them for producing oil and gas, permits drilling of exploratory wells, official sources said. The Oil Ministry was in favour of granting permission to drill exploration wells within an oil and gas field, but with the condition that cost recovery of such wells would be allowed only in case there is a commercially exploitable discovery. This essentially meant that cost for drilling any well that did not lead to a discovery or a small find that could not be independently produced, will not be allowed. At present, operators get to recover all their cost -- whether successful or failed wells, from the oil and gas produced and sold from that particular block. Sources said the ministry's technical arm DGH had opined that drilling of exploration wells in already producing oil and gas fields is not permissible under Production Sharing Contract (PSC). DGH felt the government's profit share, which is triggered when an explorer recovers all his cost, would be adversely impacted if new costs are added. RIL and Cairn however said exploration being a continuous process is allowed in the mining lease under which they currently produce gas from eastern offshore and Rajasthan blocks respectively. They felt the 'ring-fencing' proposed by DGH and seconded by the oil ministry was not practical and legal. Sources said Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily wants to test the legality of the claims and is keen to get an opinion of the Solicitor General. While RIL has proposed to drill an exploration well on the flagging D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block to study reservoir characteristic, Cairn wants to drill new probes to help raise output from the Rajasthan block to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 175,000 bpd. Globally, exploration is permitted in fields that are under production so as to keep adding new reserves to replenish ones that have been produced. In absence of rejuvenation, the fields will terminally decline from the day output starts. The same has been followed in fields in Assam and Mumbai offshore."

The well at D1 and D3 gas fields was shut about a week ago, the source said on Friday. Declining gas output from the D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin has impacted expansion plans of several power companies, and spurred demand for costly liquefied natural gas imports. Also Read: 'CAG will confine to financial audit of KG-D6 block' Gas production from D6 has declined to about 23 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd), the source said. A Reliance spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Production at the block may average 22.6 mmscmd in the fiscal year starting April 2013 and is projected to decline to 20 mmscmd in 2014/15, only about a third of the 60 mmscmd it produced in 2010 and well below the planned peak capacity of 80 mmscmd. Reliance may have to shut under-performing gas fields in 2015-16, oil secretary GC Chaturvedi said in October, while Morgan Stanley analysts have said the key gas producing fields in D6 could be exhausted in 5 years. Reliance brought in the British oil and gas company last year, which paid USD 7.2 billion to invest in 23 oil and gas blocks with the Indian firm, hoping its offshore expertise would help arrest the decline in output. The D6 block, now jointly operated by Reliance and BP, was expected to contribute up to a quarter of the gas supply for Asia's third-largest economy. Reliance and BP submitted a revised field development plan in September, cutting the gas reserves in the D6 block by about two-thirds to 3.4 trillion cubic feet, the oil ministry said last month. Reliance had government approval to drill 50 wells and had drilled only 22 with 4 turning out to be dry, the source said. Canadian company Niko Resources owns 10 percent interest in the block, while Reliance holds 60 percent and BP the rest."

RIL on November 29 shut well B4 on the main producing fields of Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) in KG-D6 block &amp;quot;due to high water cut/sanding issues,&amp;quot; according to a status report of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). Also Read: 'CAG will confine to financial audit of KG-D6 block' The shutting of the seventh well saw output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields drop to 19.02 million standard cubic meters per day from about 20 mmscmd a month ago. Together with 4.25 mmscmd from MA oil field in the same block, KG-D6 produced 23.27 mmscmd of gas in the week ending December 2, DGH said the status report dated December 3. RIL has so far drilled 22 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields but has put only 18 on production so far. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, which started gas production in April 2009, had touched a peak of 55 mmscmd in August 2010 before beginning of water and sand ingress in wells. The company had closed six wells since end-2010 and last month the seventh well was shut. The same problem has held to shutting of one-third of the wells on MA oilfield in the same block. Output from MA is half of the peak rate it had achieved in 2010. Sources said RIL had last year proposed to do workover or maintenance job to revive sick or closed wells but the Oil Ministry and DGH are yet to give their go ahead. The USD 100-120 million spending in the workover is part of the capital Budget for current fiscal which along with the same for 2010-11 and 2011-12 is pending approval. Oil Ministry says it has withheld approvals pending RIL agreeing to give the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) access of its books to conduct a second round of audit. The audit has not begun because of difference over scope of the scrutiny. RIL has so far made 18 gas and one oil discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin block in Bay of Bengal. While the lone oil find, MA went on stream in September 2008, largest among the gas finds, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 were put on production in April, 2009. Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily had previously informed Parliament that RIL had not drilled its committed 31 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 field, which was the main reason why current output does not match the targetted 80 mmscmd for this time of the year. The government, he had said, does not accept RIL's contention that geological reasons alone were responsible for the decline. RIL and its partner BP believe any additional wells in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields may not improve either production or recovery rates considering reservoir behaviour and the key to raising output was to quickly put other finds on production."

The PSC provides for a financial audit - checking of the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits, but not a performance audit that scrutinises efficacies of processes or technology used in the complex deep-sea operations.  &amp;quot;The CAG has agreed for a financial audit (of RIL's KG-D6 spendings) and a performance audit if it has to be conducted, will be done of the petroleum ministry and/or the directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH),&amp;quot; the official said. RIL will provide any documents needed in doing such an audit, he added. Sources, however, maintained that the CAG statement did not mean an end to the stalemate between the official auditor and RIL. The company, to be begin with, may refuse to provide documents related to the tendering process it followed for buying equipment or in selection of service-providers, something which is unlikely to be acceptable to the CAG, they said. The auditor may want to examine whether government's profit take from KG-D6 and its subsidy output on power and fertiliser increased on account of use of imported LNG due to KG-D6 output of just 23 million standard cubic metres per day not matching the projected profile of 80 mmscmd.  The CAG had in its first round of KG-D6 audit begun on the premise of&amp;amp;nbsp; conducting a financial audit but the report tabled in Parliament in 2011 stated that the auditor had conducted a performance audit. In May, it agreed to conduct a second round of audit for years 2008-09 to 2011-12 but that hasn't started due to differences over scope. Sources said CAG may, even this time around, conduct a performance audit of KG-D6, where gas output has lagged targets mentioned while getting spending approvals, as it feels its constitutional mandate is bigger than any agreement that the oil ministry may have with a contractor. Meanwhile, oil minister M Veerappa Moily told Rajya Sabha that the CAG has stated that since full access to KG-D6 records is pending, the ministry should &amp;quot;examine all relevant issues closely and carefully before considering the desirability of any further approvals of capital expenditure&amp;quot;."

HPCL last week asked the ministry to give firm allocation of Rajasthan crude oil for at least 10 years for it to begin work on the 9 million tonne a year refinery, sources with direct knowledge of the deliberations said. Also Read: Crude Oil prices may trade with positive bias: Nirmal Bang Cairn produces about 175,000 barrels a day or 8.75 million tonne a year of crude oil from its Mangala and other fields in the Rajasthan block. Going fowards, the firm is projecting an output of 300,000 bpd (15 million tonne). But the approved plateau is only 175,000 bpd and there is no certified data available to state that this level will last for the next 15 years (five years for refinery construction and 10 years allocation as requested by HPCL). Sources said an inland refinery is not feasible unless it has a definite source of crude oil for initial 10 years of operations. Without a crude source, it does not make any sense to build an inland unit and the company would rather look at a coastal option where crude oil can be imported from abroad. For an inland refinery, crude oil will have to be first imported at a port on the west coast, probably in Gujarat, and then transported to hinterland through an expensive pipeline. Crude oil produced at Rajasthan is transported through world's largest heated pipeline from Barmer to refiners like Reliance Industries and Essar Oil in Gujarat. Sources said if Rajasthan crude oil is allocated to the proposal refinery, this pipeline can be used for transporting imported crude oil from Gujarat coast in subsequent years. HPCL is to hold 51 per cent stake in the proposed refinery project while state-owned engineering consultancy firm EIL would take 5 per cent. Vedanta Resources, which last year acquired Cairn India for USD 8.67 billion, is interested in taking a small equity of 2-3 per cent in the project. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd and Rajasthan government too are keen on a stake in the refinery. ONGC, which owns 30 per cent interest in the Barmer oilfields of Cairn India, had in 2005 committed to building the refinery in Rajasthan but later had a change of heart. Sources said after HPCL decided to take up the project, ONGC, which originally had the authorisation from the government for processing the Barmer crude at the proposed refinery, too evinced interest in taking 26 per cent stake. However, HPCL is not keen on giving anything more than 16.96 per cent to ONGC. This being equivalent to the stake that ONGC has allowed HPCL to hold in Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd."

The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), the technical arm of the oil ministry, has since February 2010 not recognised the D-29, 30 and 31 as discoveries as RIL had not performed its prescribed tests to confirm the finds. Also Read: RIL opposes uniform marketing margin for natural gas Sources said RIL and its partner BP Plc on October 8 proposed to do a single Drill-Stem Test (DST) on the three finds to establish them as commercially viable finds. &amp;quot;Gas discoveries D-29, 30 and 31 were notified and accepted as independent discoveries, as reservoir pools were distinct and unconnected. Hence operator's (RIL's) submission that all three discoveries have same geological system is not adequate,&amp;quot; DGH wrote to RIL on November 27. DGH, however, wants three separate DSTs to be done before approving their declaration of commerciality (DoC). DoC is pre-requisite for any discovery to be developed. &amp;quot;DST in each of the three discoveries is necessary to establish absolute open flow potential (AOFP) and other reservoir parameters in order to review the DoC of D-29, 30 and 31,&amp;quot; DGH said. &amp;quot;The PSC also requires the flow to be measured at the surface by conventional petroleum industry testing methods, so as to establish sustainable production levels,&amp;quot; it added. The three finds are part of the cluster that is called the R-Series in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block. RIL believes D-29, 30 and 31 together with the largest discovery in cluster, D-34 hold gross in-place reserves of 2.207 trillion cubic feet and the four could together produce a peak output of up to 20 mmscmd. A block oversight committee headed by DGH, however, disassociated D-29, 30 and 31 and approved only D-34 with 1.267 tcf of reserves. D-34 alone can produce 14.68 mmscmd of gas from 11 wells for eight years on an investment of USD 2.338 billion. Sources said RIL-BP believes the three discoveries have resources of around 350 billion cubic feet which has the potential to add 5-7 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) to the KG-D6 production in four-five years. DGH said RIL's proposal to undertake DST in one discovery well was acceptable with the condition that a successful test would lead to drilling of development wells in that particular reservoir only. Output from KG-D6 has fallen to 23 mmscmd after hitting a peak of 62-63 mmscmd in August 2010 and the satellite finds are crucial in plans of RIL-BP to reverse the trend."

RIL, whose 13.5 cent per million British thermal unit as marketing margin on KG-D6 gas is higher than 11 cents charged on gas produced by ONGC/OIL but lower than 18 cents that charges for western offshore gas, said there was no legal basis to regulate the levy.  RIL President and COO B Ganguly on November 29 wrote to Oil Secretary debunking oil regulator PNGRB's reported advice to the government to stipulate a uniform marketing margin for sellers of domestic gas, while giving free hand to sellers of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and firms selling CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.  The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), which was asked by the Oil Ministry to go into different rates of marketing margin charged in the country, submitted its recommendations on November 22.  Stating that the PNGRB Act does not discriminate between different forms of natural gas, RIL said domestic gas sellers have been transparently charging marketing margin in a narrow range as opposed to LNG/CNG operators charing much higher rates in an opaque manner.  Marketing margin is charged by sellers to cover costs and risks associated with marketing of natural gas. &amp;quot;Costs and risks are not uniform across all sectors. These depend upon the sharing of risks under Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPA), price of gas, associated costs etc,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Risk sharing in contracts for regulated gas produced from ONGC/OIL fields, called APM, cannot be compared with that of KG-D6 where sellers have taken substantially higher risks.  &amp;quot;It would be completely incorrect to have uniform marketing margin disregarding differences in associated costs and risks assumed by different entities,&amp;quot; it said.  RIL says state-owned GAIL has been levying marketing margin on the sale of non-APM gas in the range of 18-20 cents and more than 20 cents on imported LNG.  Marketing margin for KG-D6 gas has been agreed between buyers and sellers for five years as was the &amp;amp;#36;4.2 per mmBtu price of gas fixed by the government.  While the government has clearly said no to reopening of gas price before expiry of the five year signed period, acceptance of PNGRB recommendations would mean the signed contracts between buyers and sellers are reopened before the five year period.  RIL said there was no legal basis for the government to regulate marketing margin as it relates to costs and risks associated with marketing of gas beyond the delivery point, where the gas produced from a field is sold.

Also read: Sensex may see 22000 by March 2013, says Sanju Verma Harshad Deshpande: Which are your top five stock picks for short-term? A: I would buy Reliance Industries, Tata Steel, L&amp;amp;amp;T, M&amp;amp;amp;M and Bharti Airtel among the largecaps and Talwalkar, Mahindra Holidays, IL&amp;amp;amp;FS Transportation, Dishman Pharma, Exide and Jain Irrigation among the midcaps. Rahul Arora: I have 50 Apollo Tyres shares at Rs 93 each. What should I do?  A: Tyre stocks should be held for the next one-two years. There a couple of issues dogging the sector in the last few years &ndash; cheap imported tyres being dumped in India, rubber prices touching life time high. Most of the capacity was being used for OEM supplies to the vehicle manufacturers where the margins are comparatively low. Replacement market was yet to boom. The tyre prices were not keeping pace with the increase in input costs.  The scenario has changed in the last few months. Rubber prices have seen a steep decline and expected to remain soft. The replacement market is expected to boom with record number of vehicles sold in the last few years coming up for replacement of tyres. And the product prices need not be brought down in tandem with the raw material cost, thus contributing to increased margins.&amp;amp;nbsp; In addition to Apollo tyres, I would also suggest you to buy Ceat.  Manish Jain: What is your call on Unitech and L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance? A: Strangely market rewards those companies which try to correct their course after meandering into the wilderness. Same is the case with Unitech. It went overboard in the realty sector and built up highly leveraged balance sheet and got too ambitious to invest in an unrelated area like telecom. After having burnt their fingers, they are trying to find their way back into their core competence. Whether they would be successful or not, only time will tell. The market is currently giving them an initial thumbs up. The stock could move to about Rs 37/38, but to move beyond that, the sustainability of the revised model needs to be proved.  L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance is a much better bet, a known pedigree with deep pockets and following the right strategy. It is expected that L&amp;amp;amp;T group foray into banking would be through this entity. The stock has moved up sharply in the recent past, nearly a 100 percent appreciation. Hence, I would suggest you to wait for a correction. Chandrayee Sarkar: Is it right time to invest in Heritage Foods India Ltd? A: Not, after it has appreciated 100 percent in the last three months. Just because a savvy investor has bought at current levels does not merit a blind buy. Even savvy investors make mistakes. The branded retail story is taking shape, but wait for a correction to around Rs 400/410 levels.  Kishore Tirumala: I have 1,500 shares of GTL Infra at Rs 13? Can hold for long-term? A: GTL Infra could get some perk up due to Bharti Infratel IPO. The financials are in bad shape. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this as an investment. When you invest in a stock, you should first check whether the management is dependable or not. And there is no reason for us to believe this since the last 10 years.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Yousuf Sheikh: I just purchased Moser Baer for Rs 8.28. What is the prospect for this scrip? A: A company, which is into sectors such as storage media and solar power, which face rapid technology obsolescence and is unable to cope up with the same should be avoided at any cost, can only lead to destruction of shareholder wealth. We have seen that happening in the last few years. Don&rsquo;t expect any major change and thus avoid. Since most of the controversial stocks have started moving in the recent upmove, this could also show some positive move based on various rumours floating in the market. Utilise that and exit. Pankaj Srivastava: What is the six-month target of Bharti Airtel?  A: I expect Bharti to move to about Rs 360 in the next month or two. The government has slipped badly on the spectrum pricing and now they have decided to slash it further by another 30 percent. That is a moral victory for the telecom sector. Secondly, the Bharti Infratel issue could be another reason for the sentimental upmove on listing of the IPO. I also expect them to report better numbers in December as the rationalisation effort of the last few months will start paying dividends. Lastly tariff revision will be a trigger to take it up further. My six-month target is about 410 to 420."

The block oversight panel, called the Managing Committee headed the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons had on January 3 this year approved an optimised field development plan for the four satellite gas discoveries (D-2, D-6, D-19 and D-22) in KG-DWN-98/3 (or KG-D6) block. The approved plan envisaged drilling of 8 development gas wells. The development well KG-D6-G2 on the D-19 discovery is part of that plan, sources said. This will be first development well to be drilled since BP came into RIL's acreage. RIL-BP had lost the last four-month weather window available for drilling in Bay of Bengal as approvals did not come in time. They started spudding the well when the weather window opened this month. The approved development plan for the four satellite finds envisages a peak production of 10.30 million standard cubic meters per day. Output is projected to begin in mid-2016. The four fields will help augment output from the main D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields which have seen production drop from 55 mmscmd peak achieved in August 2010 to under 19 mmscmd currently. Water and sand ingress has led to closure of a third of the 18 producers on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3. Together with about 5 mmscmd output from MA oil and gas field in the same Krishna Godavari basin block, the current output is hovering around 23 mmscmd. RIL has till date made 18 gas and one oil find in the KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal. Of these, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas finds, were put on production in April 2009 while MA oil field came into production in September 2008.

The country's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which costs three times the price of domestic gas, is projected to rise exponentially over the next two-three years, according to latest projections made by the Oil Ministry. Imports of LNG or natural gas - cooled to its liquid form for ease of transporting in ships - at 39.32 million standard cubic meters a day constituted 25.5 per cent of the total consumption of the fuel in India in 2011-12. This share will rise to 41 per cent in current fiscal and to 50 per cent in the next, the ministry's projections showed. Also Read: Rangarajan panel report on oil, gas pricing in DecSell crude, natural gas; divided on gold: Experts  In 2012-13, domestic natural gas production is estimated to be around 104 mmscmd, down from 114.90 mmscmd in the previous fiscal primarily because KG-D6 output has slipped to 23 mmscmd from over 30 mmscmd last year. In current fiscal, LNG imports will jump to 73 mmscmd and are projected to further rise to 105 mmscmd in 2013-14, equalling the domestic gas production of that year. In 2014-15, imports at 115 mmscmd will surpass domestic production of 113 mmscmd, the ministry estimates said. For a nation whose current account deficit is already battered by 79 per cent reliance on imports for meeting oil needs, higher share of LNG is not be a good news. Industry officials said the domestic output has stagnated in absence of remunerative prices. UK's BP Plc, which partners RIL in the flagging KG-D6 gas block and other gas discovery areas, recently wrote to Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily saying around 5 trillion cubic feet of discoveries in KG-D6 and NEC-25 block in Mahanadi basin can be developed on price clarity. The reserves RIL-BP has are more than the remaining resource in state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp's fields. Majority of domestic natural gas is priced at USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit which is one-third the price at which LNG is imported by Petronet LNG Ltd and other firms. The government has been resisting revising the domestic prices fearing its impact on power tariffs and fertiliser cost even as KG-D6 output has plummeted to less than half to 24 mmscmd. Industry officials said that the world over countries have raised price for domestic produce. Last week, Argentina trippled wellhead price for new natural gas production to USD 7.50 per mmBtu. The South American nation too imported LNG at up to USD 15 per mmBtu rate, quite similar to the position in India. Neighbouring Pakistan too has announced a new exploration policy giving price of USD 7 for shallow water finds, USD 8 for deepsea discoveries and USD 9 for ultradeep exploration. China too has offered subsidises to energy companies who develop the nation's shale-gas resources."

RIL's Dubai-based subsidiary Reliance Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production DMCC &amp;quot;signed the completion documents for divestment of its 25 percent working interest in the Yemen's Block-9 to Medco Yemen Malik Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk of Indonesia,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement. The firm had announced the sale of its stake in the oil producing block in August. The stake sale followed RIL exiting from two oil blocks in Kurdistan region of Iraq on July 19. RIL had in 2001 won Yemen's Block 9 along with Hood Energy and Calvalley Petroleum Inc. RIL and Hood Energy held 25-percent stake each while Calvalley had the remaining 50percent. RIL said the sale agreement with Medco would be effective from January 1. While the agreement is for a 25 percent interest, Medco would effectively have a 21.25 percent participating interest in the block because, under a regulation in Yemen, the contractor of a production-sharing agreement has to accommodate a working interest for the country, which is represented by the Yemen Oil and Gas Company, which will hold a 15-percent stake. Accordingly, the operator Calvalley Petroleum would have 42.5-percent interest and Hood Oil a 21.25-percent stake. Block 9 lies covers 2,234 square kilometres in the Sayun- Masila basin in Yemen's Hadramaut province, about 350-km north-east of the Yemeni capital, Sana. It is estimated to hold proven plus probable reserves of 58.6 million barrels of oil. RIL would get another USD 5 million if the block produces 10,000 barrels of oil per day. The block currently produces between 6,000 bpd and 6,500 bpd. A 20-year construction contract was granted over the block by the Yemeni government in 2005 which the joint venture can apply to have extended for a further five years after 2025. After the sale, RIL will be left with interest in blocks 34 and 37 in eastern Yemen where is is investing USD 66 million with its patner Hood.  RIL had in July sold its 80-percent interest in Rovi and Sarta onland blocks in northern Iraq to US oil behemoth Chevron Corp for a reported USD 200 million.The exits are part of the company's overseas asset restructuring wherein it is cutting exposure in exploration blocks to focus on producing properties. After the exit from Kurdistan and Yemen, RIL now is left with a portfolio of 10 overseas oil and gas assets including two each in Peru, Yemen, Oman and Colombia and one each in East Timor and Australia.

Oil and gas reservoirs are dynamic system and not inert cold storage facilities. They are both subject to and respond to production rates and flows,&amp;quot; RIL wrote to the oil secretary. Also Read: RIL agrees to CAG scrutiny expenses in KG gas block In the letter to the oil secretary GC Chaturvedi, RIL executive director PMS Prasad sought appointment of a team of international experts of repute to independently verify its estimates as well as the action that have been taken. Gas production from D1-D3 started declining from a plateau level of about 55 million standard cubic meters per day in August 2010. It is currently less than 20 mmscmd. Six out of the 18 wells on the field have been shut due to high water and sand ingress. KG-D6 is currently producing around 25 mmscmd after including output from the MA field. &amp;quot;Worldover, oil and gas fields are known to be unpredictable... Buried deep in geological frontiers, miles below the surface, surprises are a common occurrence. Deep water basins (like KG-D6) add to the complexity as technologies to assess sub surface conditions several kilometers are even less perfect,&amp;quot; he wrote. Referring to gas reserve estimates of being lowered from 10.03 trillion cubic feet to 3.4 Tcf, RIL cited state-owned ONGC encountering similar geological surprises in Neelam gas field off west coast and in Imperial Energy assets in Russia. RIL has at all times kept the government informed that the D1-D3 reservoir has thrown up unanticipated surprises and has shared all the relevant information and data,&amp;quot; he wrote, adding the company had on several occasions sought appointment of international experts to verify its claims so that &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; could be averted. Prasad said while, on the one hand, RIL has been accused of escalating costs and, on the other, it is being targeted for expending capital in drilling wells to increase production. &amp;quot;Four wells drilled after commencement of production in D1-D3 have conclusively proved that drilling additional wells would be infructuous. If the contractor (RIL) were really to benefit from escalating costs, we would have gone ahead and drilled all the wells demanded by DGH at an additional expense of nearly USD 2 billion,&amp;quot; he wrote. Instead, RIL has cut back on all infructuous expenditure and scaled down cost estimates by nearly USD 3 billion as all technical information now available showed that adding new wells in D1-D3 field would not add to production, he added."

RIL, however, says contractually there was no scope for CAG doing a performance audit and the scrutiny should be strictly a financial audit as has been promised by the Oil Ministry. RIL President and COO (Business) B Ganguly on July 16 wrote to the Oil Ministry saying the company &amp;quot;was agreeable for audit of Block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) by the CAG as per Section 1.9 of the Accounting Procedure to the Production Sharing Contract.&amp;quot; OilMin withdraws note opposing KG-D6 gas price hike by RIL &amp;quot;As agreed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, it will be a financial audit and conducted in compliance with various sub-sections of Section 1.9 and it will not be a performance audit,&amp;quot; he added. The company agreed to cooperate in the audit even if the exercise is conducted after a lapse of two years. The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) provides for audit within two year of the period being scrutinised and only under exceptional circumstances can it be done even after lapse of the mandated period. RIL, he said, did not agree with the reasons given by the ministry as constituting exceptional circumstances for audit of time barred years but &amp;quot;as a gesture of cooperation&amp;quot; it has agreed to CAG doing the audit of spendings during 2008-09 to 2011-12 as an exception. The firm had previously stated that CAG cannot do a audit of time-barred periods and that the audit report be submitted to the Oil Ministry, as provided under PSC, and not to Parliament. Also, it wanted CAG to maintain confidentiality of the information shared and not make them public. CAG had strongly contested the conditions and the Oil Ministry too had been pressing RIL to give CAG &amp;quot;unfettered access to account books&amp;quot;. RIL, in the November 16 letter, referred to meetings held with the Oil Ministry to state that the company has been emphasising that &amp;quot;the report shall be kept confidential as required by the PSC&amp;quot;. CAG, it said, can conduct audit/special performance audit of the ministry or the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) after the audit process under the PSC was completed. Stating that RIL had assured cooperation in such an exercise, Ganguly said &amp;quot;as agreed such performance audit of the Ministry/DGH would not be mixed with the audit of the contractor's (RIL's) accounting books and records which will be an independent standalone audit.&amp;quot; Also, RIL &amp;quot;would not be subjected to any adverse implication of its economic interest as a result of the performance audit of the Ministry/DGH,&amp;quot; he added."

Moneycontrol brings to you some of the recommendations given by experts that will help you cash in on the many opportunities available. Stocks picks for today: Sudarshan Sukhani, s2analytics.com is bullish on Union Bank of India. &amp;quot;The stock had a fantastic rally from Rs 150 to Rs 230 and then went through a brief decline. That decline is over now. It is now resuming its uptrend. This uptrend should take it to new highs. It&rsquo;s a good stock,&amp;quot; he elaborates.  Sukhani has a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; call on Britannia Industries. &amp;quot;Sometimes the blue chip stocks gives significant and stupendous breakouts all of a sudden, maybe Britannia will do it, if not today, next week. It&rsquo;s readily poised for that. It has made a bullish head and shoulder pattern, after a small correction,&amp;quot; he asserts. Sukhani is also betting on Coal India. &amp;quot;The stock went through a correction and then it stopped falling. That itself was a first sign that this is not a bear market. It is not a deep correction, it&rsquo;s a shallow correction and then we have seen a double bottom. That&rsquo;s a very interesting pattern because normally double bottom comes after big declines, but this one has come on a small correction. It is not willing to go up. So, I could sometime classify it as a micro double bottom, a small pattern, but it has bullish overtones. So, one buy it. If the market is willing to go up today Coal India could be a major contributor.&amp;quot;  Also read: Is it time to look at sugar stocks? Brokerage calls: Stock: Bharti Airtel Brokerage: UBS Rating: Buy Target: Rs 425 Rationale: The stock looks well positioned to gain from the inflection in pricing and regulatory landscape in the Indian telecom space. The realisations per minute are likely to improve significantly due to a reduction in free promotional minutes and headline tariff increases. Stock: HUL Brokerage: Macquarie Rating: Outperform Target: Rs 620 Rationale: The stock has corrected 10 percent, since earnings, due to concerns on sales growth fatigue in the personal products category. However, the company's recent initiatives suggest that the growth uptrend will persist. Stock: Reliance Industries Brokerage: CLSA Rating: Outperform Target: Rs 850 Rationale: Singapore GRM benchmarks have fallen up to USD 2.5 per barrel QoQ and this has impacted the stock. However, their Reliance GRM tracker is up over USD 1 per barrel QoQ on the back of improvement in spreads of Naphtha and LPG as well as lower input costs due to rise in light heavy crude spreads and severe decline in fuel oil spread. They say this should allow reliance to outperform benchmark GRMs in Q3. _PAGEBREAK_ Stock: NTPC Brokerage: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Rating: Underperform Target: Rs 153 Rationale: The 9.5 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;stake sale by the government is a potential overhang, given the weak execution and its rich valuation. Stock: GSK Pharma Brokerage: Nomura Rating: Underperform Target: Rs 1,795 Rationale: Under the new pharma pricing policy cleared by the Cabinet, the prices of essential drugs are likely to fall by 15-20 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;versus earlier expectations of 8-12 percent. GSK Pharma will be the worst hit due to the new policy. Stock: Tata Steel Brokerage: JPMorgan Rating: Overweight Target: Rs 530 Rationale: According to them, the price hikes in Europe atleast signal that steel prices have likely bottomed out, and from here price hike announcements by various companies, should allow re-stocking demand to come back. They see that the benefits of this flowing into Tata Steel's Q4 numbers. Stock: Cipla Brokerage: CLSA Rating: Outperform Target: Rs 400 Rationale: They say Cipla's proposal to acquire 51 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;of Cipla Medpro for USD 220 million seems attractive for Cipla India as the latter could drive synergies between two entities, considering it has been manufacturing partner for Medpro for decades. The acquisition is reasonably valued at 1.7x price to sales, 11x trailing earnings and provides Cipla direct footing in South African branded generic market. Stock: Sun Pharma Brokerage: Nomura Rating: Neutral Target: Rs 690 Rationale: They believe the new proposal to cap prices based on the arithmetic average is incrementally negative, although they say it is unlikely to be materially disruptive. The earlier proposal impacted the FY14 base business EBIDTA of Cadila, Ranbaxy&amp;amp;nbsp;and Cipla by 5-8 percent and 3&amp;amp;nbsp;percent for Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy's. The new proposal will have higher negative impact of 6-10 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;for Cadila, Ranbaxy and Cipla and up to 5 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;EBITDA impact for Sun, Lupin and Dr Reddy's."

Rather it has been seeking clarity on the basis of gas pricing that will be adopted post March 2014,&amp;quot; company Executive Director P M S Prasad said. The government had in 2007 approved USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit as the price of KG-D6 gas for first five years of production. KG-D6 began pumping gas from April, 2009. Prasad said the formula used to arrive at the current gas price was submitted to the government for approval in April 2007, a full two years before the gas production commenced. The government slightly modified the formula and approved a price of USD 4.2 per mmBtu in October. RIL's request for a new price for KG-D6 from April 2014 follows the same pattern of giving time to the government to debate and decide. &amp;quot;To make investment decisions to bring gas from new developments after 2014, it is necessary that approval for gas prices are similarly obtained now,&amp;quot; Prasad said. &amp;quot;This clarity is required because the contractor partners have to make significant investments to develop various new discoveries.&amp;quot; Dismissing reports that RIL is seeking a three-fold hike in gas price, he said, &amp;quot;Some vested interests were trying to create a needless controversy on the issue.&amp;quot; Prasad said as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), RIL is contractually bound to sell all gas produced from the block at arms-length prices to the benefit of all the parties to the PSC. &amp;quot;In early 2012, arms-length prices for gas in the country were higher than the price approved by Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) in 2007. RIL was receiving numerous offers from buyers seeking to purchase gas at prices higher than those approved,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;quot;As per the provisions of the PSC, RIL was constrained to bring the willingness of buyers to pay higher gas price, to the notice of the Government and seek its directions.&amp;quot; But since then the company has not been pushing for any revision in rates before expiry of current prices in end of March 2014. &amp;quot;The price of gas determines not just the share of the contractor but also the revenues flowing to the Government as royalty, profit share and taxes,&amp;quot; he added.

The new rating follows the recent correction in the stock, which is now quoting around Rs 765, below Kotak's target price of Rs 775. &amp;quot;We see near-term headwinds for RIL's core businesses from (1) lower refining margins, (2) subdued chemical margins and (3) a sharp decline in KG-D6 production. Value creation from RIL&rsquo;s new projects is 3-4 years away and will depend on (1) assumptions of conversion margins and (2) incremental gas production,&amp;quot; Kotak analysts Sanjeev Prasad, Tarun Lakhotia and Vinay Kumar wrote in their note. According to the trio, the only upside trigger for the stock is if the government agrees to the company's proposal to raise price of its gas from the KG-D6 block, before April 1, 2014. The report estimates that refining margins will be subdued over the next 12-18 months due to likely large net additions to global refining capacity and weak oil demand resulting from a global slowdown. Also, Prasad and his team see downside risks to the management guidance on FY2013-15 production from KG-D6. &amp;quot;A reversal of decline in production from a revised development plan for the producing fields and incremental production from approved satellite fields is unlikely before FY2016-17E. Development work may also be delayed further due to the ongoing issues with the Government on (1) gas pricing, (2) scope of the CAG audit and (3) cost recovery,&amp;quot; the report said. Kotak Securities expects the stock to get support in the Rs 725-775 range because of the ongoing share buyback program."

In a surprise move, the Ministry had on October 10 moved a note to the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) opposing a hike in price of RIL's KG-D6 gas before April 2014 even though the company itself was not seeking a revision before that date. &amp;quot;Yes, the note to EGoM has been withdrawn,&amp;quot; a top ministry official said. This was done in view of panel haded by Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council Chairman C Rangarajan being asked to suggest &amp;quot;structure and elements of the guidelines for determining the basis or formula for the price of domestically produced gas, and for monitoring actual price fixation.&amp;quot; Prime Minister had appointed the six-member panel to essentially look at the design of future contracts for exploration of of oil and gas. It had also been tasked to suggest pricing of natural gas. Sources said the Ministry had in the October 10 note to EGoM members argued that a higher price of KG-D6 gas would result in USD 6.3 billion rise in subsidy burden. RIL, it said, would get an additional USD 4.1 billion revenue if the rates are hiked from current USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit to import parity rates of USD 14.2-14.51 per mmBtu. The government on the other hand would get only USD 0.5 billion at current year production level of around 25 million standard cubic metres per day. Sources said the ministry stated that a USD 10 rise in gas price would result in increase in subsidy paid on fertiliser and power by USD 6.3 billion. The Ministry, however, in the note did not state that RIL had modified its January request for a price revision to clearly state it is seeking rate revision only from April 1, 2014 when the current price is due to expire. RIL first in June and then again on September 6 reiterated its demand for a price at par with the rate India is paying for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from April 1, 2014 when the current five-year period of USD 4.2 price expires. It wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. At USD 110 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 14.23 per mmBtu. Sources said the company has also proposed to price gas it plans to produce from coal seams, called coal-bed methane (CBM), from Sohagpur blocks in Madhya Pradesh according to the same formula. Its CBM pricing formula as well as Essar Oil's demand for USD 4.2 per mmBtu price of CBM from its Raniganj block in West Bengal had been referred Rangarajan for review."

The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) on November 2 wrote to the Joint Secretary (Exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that one development well KG-D6-G2 in the Dhirubhai-19 or D-19 field may be agreed. D-19 is one of the four satellite gas field whose optimised field development plan (OFDP) was approved in January this year, the DGH wrote. &amp;quot;Approved OFDP envisaged eight development gas wells with a peak gas production level of 10.30 million standard cubic meters per day,&amp;quot; it said. RIL has till date made 18 gas and one oil find in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal. Of these, Dhirubhai-1 and 3, the largest of the 18 gas finds, were put on production in April 2009 while MA oil field came into production in September 2008.

High water and sand ingress has forced RIL to shut six out of the 18 wells on the fields. MA field has seen output drop for the same reasons from over 8 mmscmd to 5.05 mmscmd. In a separate letter, the DGH advised RIL &amp;quot;to monitor the water/gas ratio closely and adopt suitable measures in case of deviation from the envisaged profile.&amp;quot; The satellite fields are key to RIL reversing the flagging output from the KG-D6 block. The company had in July, 2008, submitted a FDP to exploit reserves of 1,708 billion cubic feet (bcf) in nine satellite gas discoveries (D-2, D-4, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-16, D-19, D-22 and D-23) in the D6 block at an estimated capex of USD 5.91 billion. This, the DGH found, was not techno-economically viable. Thereafter, RIL submitted OPDPF for four satellite (D-2, 6, 9 and 22) gas discoveries on December 19, 2009. A peak gas production rate of 10.30 mmscmd is envisaged from the four where recoverable reserves are estimated at 617 billion cubic meters out of an inplace reserves of 1.343 tcf. DGH said the OFDP was approved by the KG-D6 block oversight panel, called the Management Committee on January 3 this year. This envisages commencement of gas supply from mid-2016, it added. RIL's proposal to invest up to USD 2.338 billion to produce about 15 mmscmd of gas from D-24, or the R-Series gas field in the same block is also pending approval.

The company has also refuted the former&amp;amp;nbsp;oil minister Jaipal Reddy's claims that a higher price of fuel as demanded by it would result in a USD 6.3 billion rise in subsidy burden. The ministry's argument is that if gas price is hiked from current USD 4.2 million British thermal unit to import parity rates of USD 14.51 per mmBtu, RIL would certainly get an additional USD 4.1 billion revenues. But RIL argues it needs to recover costs made on the project and hence price hike is inevitable, say sources. The company has also said that the&amp;amp;nbsp;Supreme court had in the RIL-RNRL case said gas price needs to be market aligned and asked the government to revise gas price if it is below the market rate, the RIL has said in the letter to the panel. The company has said it has 5.5 tcf of gas and quoted a price upwards of &amp;amp;#36;10/mmBtu.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Also, ramping up production at its flagship KG-D6&amp;amp;nbsp;basin would need higher investments, argues RIL. It may be recalled that in June, RIL had modified this to seek a rate equivalent to the price India pays for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from April 1, 2014 when the current price is due to expire. RIL is seeking to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67 percent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu.  The formula proposed by the energy giant is the same at which Petronet LNG, the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer, buys 7.5 million tonnes per annum (30 million standard cubic metres per day) of LNG from RasGas of Qatar.  Meanwhile, according to the Rangarajan committee, the share of profit to the government should commence from the first day of production instead of the existing one where profits start when all costs have been recovered. It has also recommended that the revenue which the contractor will earn even after this should be shared with the government. The committee is expected to submit its final report&amp;amp;nbsp;by December. RIL has stated that government is not entitled to fix and regulate gas prices and if it forces that company to do so, it would be against the production sharing contract document, which it had signed with the government when it was awarded blocks off the KG-D6 coast. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

The bidding for the airwaves is scheduled to start from November 12. The telecom industry had been seeking further easing of the ECB norms as banks are reluctant to lend money to the sector.  In order to develop the telecom sector, the government in January 2010 had provided a window of 12 months to successful bidders for the 2G auction for refinancing the rupee loan from domestic lenders to make payment for spectrum allocation with a long-term ECB under the approval route. &amp;quot;Keeping in view the large outlay of funds required to be paid directly to the government within a limited period of time, relaxation has been provided for the upcoming 2G auction,&amp;quot; the official added. Finance ministry official said that bidders could also avail of short-term currency loans in the nature of bridge-finance under the automatic route for making upfront payment towards 2G spectrum allocation and replace it with long-term ECB under the automatic route, subject to certain terms and conditions. Next week, the government is auctioning spectrum at a minimum bid price of Rs 14,000 crore for 5 MHz of airwaves across 22 telecom zones. The auction-based price is more than seven times that the carriers paid in earlier sales where airwaves were bundled with telecom permits. Airtel and Vodafone are among the telecom gianta that have applied to bid in the auction, but Reliance Industries and Russia's Sistema surprised by staying away.

RIL has so far made four consecutive gas discoveries in the KG-DWN-2003/1 (D3) block that sits in the same area as its now producing KG-D6 gas fields. Of these four finds, two have so far not been declared commercial by the government, a step necessary before they can be put to production. &amp;quot;A revised proposal for the declaration of commerciality (DOC) for the Dhirubhai 39 and 41 natural gas discoveries, submitted earlier this year, remained under review by the government,&amp;quot; Hardy said in its Interim Management Statement. RIL, which is the operator of the block with 60 per cent interest, has so far made four consecutive gas discoveries -- Dhirubhai 39, 41, 44 and 52 in the block. Hardy holds 10 per cent interest while the rest 30 per cent is held by BP Plc. &amp;quot;The government of India's review of the D3 DOC proposal will likely continue into 2013,&amp;quot; Hardy said. Once DoC is approved, RIL-BP-Hardy will put together a field development plan to bring the finds to production. &amp;quot;The proposed development plan provides for a dry gas, sub-sea cluster development with the flexibility to add in additional wells and to include possible adjoining area of discoveries,&amp;quot; Hardy said. Situated in the Krishna Godavari Basin, a prolific petroleum province on the East coast of India, the D3 exploration licence encompasses an area of 3,288 square kilometers and is located approximately 45 km offshore. RIL has contracted deep-water drillship Dhirubhai Deepwater KG2 to drill a fifth exploration well on the block. The rig is expected to arrive in Indian waters by the end of the year and drilling of the well is expected to commence in the first half of 2013, Hardy said. &amp;quot;Through 2013 we will continue to collaborate actively with our partners RIL and BP to optimise the exploration programme for this highly prospective block,&amp;quot; it said. Processing of 3D seismic data covering the eastern area of the D3 block is also expected to be completed by the end of 2012. About 3,250 sq km of 3D seismic data over the block has already been acquired. RIL will continue to undertake a number of geotechnical studies, which have been focused on assessing the potential of the eastern area of the block and high grading prospects, including testing deeper play types, Hardy said. &amp;quot;The KG Basin is a world-class petroleum province and together with rapidly improving Indian gas pipeline infrastructure and the high demand for gas, the prospects for the economic development of gas resources in this area are excellent,&amp;quot; it added."

Check out his comments. Also read: Mother-of-bull markets is ahead of us, says Jhunjhunwala D.n. Verma: Should one go for equity or gold? A: At this stage, one should go for a judicious mix of gold and equity.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the bias should be towards equity. While gold has appreciated significantly over the last 12-18 months, there exists scope for further gradual appreciation in gold price over medium to long-term.&amp;amp;nbsp; Thus, parking anywhere between 10 to 20% of surplus in gold may be advised.  On the other hand, inspite of recent run-up in the equity, there exists significant opportunity of value buying even at current levels.&amp;amp;nbsp; With growth momentum slowly coming back in the economy, it is expected that equity market will also gain traction over the next 6-12 months.&amp;amp;nbsp; Ofcourse, one needs to be careful in selecting stocks and identifying sectors.  Harsha Jethmalani: Should any correction in Reliance Industries (RIL) be seen as an opportunity to buy? A: Reliance Industries is a good buy for long-term.&amp;amp;nbsp; The company is in right businesses with lots of liquidity.&amp;amp;nbsp; Though at present few of their businesses are under pressure, in the medium to long-term, RIL will surely outperform the market. However, it should be also understood that in the short-term RIL will continue to remain volatile.  Ravi Cheke: What is your call on Canara Bank, State Bank of India and Axis Bank? A:&amp;amp;nbsp; One needs to be cautious while selecting stocks in the banking sector.&amp;amp;nbsp; The stress in the economy is getting reflected in the asset quality of banks. PSU banks are definitely more affected compared to their private sector peers.  At current valuation, Canara Bank, State Bank of India and even Axis Bank look attractive for long-term.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the overall non-performing asset (NPA) situation, the changing provisioning norms and the economic uncertainties, prevents us from recommending investment in this space at this point of time.  Joel Peter Lobo: What about L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance, JSW Steel and NTPC? A: With long-term perspective, exposure can be taken in L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance and NTPC .&amp;amp;nbsp; Infact, NTPC is a good buy at current level with medium to long-term perspective.&amp;amp;nbsp; NTPC is the largest and most efficient power producer with better backend and frontend tie-ups (i.e. coal linkages and SEB buyback arrangements).  Globally, the steel industry is going through a huge turmoil with significant reduction in demand from China and various other developed markets.&amp;amp;nbsp; Global steel companies are underperforming the benchmark indices.&amp;amp;nbsp; In case of JSW Steel, there are further company specific regulatory and operational adversities.&amp;amp;nbsp; Thus, it is advisable to avoid taking exposure in JSW Steel at this stage.  Alpesh Patel: I have 500 shares of Reliance Capital at Rs 410. What should I do now? A: While the valuation looks attractive, considering price correction that has taken place in this counter over the last couple of years, the overall economic and business environment does not support any rationale for buying.&amp;amp;nbsp; The company&rsquo;s wish to obtain banking license may not bear immediate fruit, and that may act as a dampener to the sentiment in the counter, in the near future. Manish Mittal: Is Electrosteel a good option for long-term investment? A: With long-term perspective, exposure can be taken in Electrosteel.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, it should be noted that current turmoil in the global steel industry affects even special steel manufacturers.&amp;amp;nbsp; Thus, in the short-term, no miracle should be expected from this scrip.  Prashant Jain Barar: I have Reliance Power at Rs&amp;amp;nbsp; 202.&amp;amp;nbsp; What I shoud do? A: At an opportune moment, you can switch from Reliance Power to NTPC.&amp;amp;nbsp; This will enable you to reduce execution risk from your power portfolio.  Chandan Salaskar: What is the future of Union Bank of India?  A: The future of Union Bank is good.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the current economic environment, existing asset quality pressure, provisioning norms and near-term economic outlook does not support investment rationale in PSU banking space at present.  Prabhat Manohar Tamhankar: Is Marico a 'buy' now? A: Investment can be made in Marico with medium to long-term perspective. In the short-term, the counter may be volatile as few key raw material prices may fluctuate in the near future.  Sunil Pareek: What about UCO Bank? A: The future of UCO Bank is good.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the current economic environment, existing asset quality pressure, provisioning norms and near-term economic outlook does not support investment rationale in PSU banking space at present.  Mukul Mansinghka: Which real estate stock would you suggest now? A: Out of real estate stocks, investment in Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty is recommended with medium-long tem perspective.&amp;amp;nbsp; Aggressive investors can also explore investments in Orbit Corporation.  Apart from everything, the quality of management, corporate governance, business practices etc. should be critically examined prior to taking exposure in real estate counters.  Abhinandan Jain: What is your view on Housing Development and Infrastructure (HDIL) now? A: Investment in HDIL is not recommended considering the current economic environment and company specific issues.&amp;amp;nbsp; Short-term price appreciation may happen due to multiple factors.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, medium-long term view in this counter is uncertain and will be contingent upon multiple factors both macro and micro."

The well G-1-9 in Bay of Bengal has been leaking gas since August-end and all efforts by ONGC to contain the flow have so far been futile. &amp;quot;This is a very old, drilled some eight or 10 years back. It wasn't producing till now and we had plans to put in on production sometime next year along with other gas finds in the area,&amp;quot; a company official said. However, an uncontrolled flow of gas started from the well around August 30. After attempting in-house solutions, the company is now looking at outside specalists to cap the well. There are fears that the well may start spilling oil too, which may spell environmental disaster.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;We have no idea how much gas (mostly methane) might have spilled but I suppose it must be at least one lakh cubic meters per day,&amp;quot; the official said.&amp;amp;nbsp;  ONGC is developing G-1 field along with neighbouring GS-15. Both the fields are marginal or small finds. G-1-9 well was part of this development through which ONGC had planned to produce 2.7 million standard cubic meters of gas and 9,400 barrels of associated oil daily. The official said The company has sought help of Coast Guard and Navy as well as neighbouring operators like Reliance Industries-BP combine and Cairn India to control the gas leak.&amp;amp;nbsp; ONGC had in the integrated development of G-1 and GS-15 targeted to produce 0.982 million tonnes of oil and 5.92 billion cubic meters of gas by 2020-21. The project at the time of conception in 2003 was to cost Rs 429.82 crore but the cost was subsequently revised to Rs 1,262.93 crore in 2004 and then to Rs 2218.01 crore in 2010.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The company had planned to being production from the fields by April-May but the gas spill may result in delays, he said adding drilling on GS-15 field was completed last August.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The project had time and cost overrun as the contactor (Clough Ltd of Australia) defaulted in work. ONGC terminated the contract in June 2006.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  Of the two, G1 is a deepwater field and is located 20 km away from the shore. GS15 is a shallow water field. G1 was the first deepwater field to be developed by ONGC."

The new minister has made it clear that he will look at addressing RIL&rsquo;s plea to up gas prices before 2014--a move that was strongly resisted by the erstwhile oil ministry. RIL has repeatedly said that the process of price discovery should be allowed as per the provisions in the production sharing contract (PSC) which allows contractors discover through an open and transparent bidding process at arms-length price of gas. The discovered rate, which as estimated by RIL to be around USD 12.93 per mmbtu is much higher than the current rate of USD 4.2 mmbtu and is due for revision only in April 2014. In June, it had modified this to seek a rate equivalent to the price India pays for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from April 1, 2014 when the current price is due to expire. RIL is seeking to price KG--D6 gas at 12.67 percent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu.  The formula proposed by RIL is the same at which Petronet LNG Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp; , the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer, buys 7.5 million tonnes per annum (30 million standard cubic metres per day) of LNG from RasGas of Qatar.  Sources said RIL may be asked to invite bids from the customers, particularly power and fertiliser, to find if their is enough demand at this price. If demand equivalent to KG-D6 output or more is generated then this rate could be approved. However, analysts say that though the market has reacted positively to the development, it is a wait and watch situation as of now. &ldquo;The announcement is surely a big positive for RIL, but how soon the minister can bring about changes cannot be ascertained so soon&rdquo; said Mayur Patel from Spark Capital. &amp;quot;Sentiment-wise this would be positive, as with the earlier minister approvals were not coming on time. Talks between the company and the ministry may improve,&amp;quot; said an industry analyst at a large domestic brokerage, who declined to be identified.V.K Vijayakumar, Investment strategist at Geogit BNP Paribas, said Moily may fast track some approvals. &amp;quot;Further approval regarding the joint application by Reliance Industries and BP for KG-D6 gas might get expedited, that is one possibility,&amp;quot; he said.  Moody's Investors Service said the approval was a positive development for Reliance's credit profile as it signalled an improvement in a &amp;quot;thorny&amp;quot; relationship.  &amp;quot;If this improvement in relations between RIL and the government of India continues, we expect both sides to also reach a decision on gas prices,&amp;quot; Moody's said in a weekly report on Monday, which made no mention of the change of oil minister.

Net profit improved by 21% y-o-y, mainly due to higher other income and posted better refining margins of &amp;amp;#36;9.5/bbl. Net sales improved by 15% to Rs 90,335 cr on Y-o-Y largely due to higher prices of products and increase in volume. Other income was higher at Rs2,112 cr as against Rs 1,345 cr on a y-o-y basis primarily due to higher average liquid investments of Rs 79,159cr. Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas: 37% Dip in revenue on Y-o-Y basis and ~10% on Q-o-Q basis to Rs 2,254cr mainly due to fall in production to the level of 28.8 mmscmd (AvgQ2FY13) and natural decline continue in PMT field. Weaker rupee helped to realize 20% higher revenue in rupee term on Y-o-Y basis. RIL continues to highlight that complexity of reservoir and higher water cut have been causing the production decline. Oil and gas production from PMT fields was also down ~9% and ~6% Q-o-Q respectively; these fields are in natural decline. In order to ramp-up production over the next three to four years, RIL is focusing on KG D6, NEC-25, Panna-Mukta-Tapti and coal bed methane blocks. In August 2012,RIL-BP submitted a revised field development plan for currently producing D1-D3 fields to the Management Committee. This revised FDP calls for installation of increased water handling capacity and additional compression capacity over the next 2-3 years to address the decline in reservoir pressure. RIL believes this will help it to increase the reserve life of current producing fields. Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing: Revenue increased by 23% on y-o-y basis to Rs 83,878cr in Q2FY13. Increase in revenue principally due to higher price environment of products (18%) and increase in volume accounted by 1.4%.

At a meeting convened by Pulok Chatterji, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, on September 24, it was decided that RIL should be allowed to find through bidding if consumers are willing to pay more than the current rate USD 4.2 per mmBtu when rates are due for a revision in April 2014. Sources privy to the development said the PMO stated that the process of price discovery may be allowed as per the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The PSC provides for contractors like RIL discovering through an open and transparent bidding process an arms-length price of gas. The so discovered rate is then put to the government for approval.

ONGC has made nine gas discoveries in its KG block KG-DWN-98/2, which sits next to RIL's flagging KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. It plans to club these finds with discoveries in another neighbouring block to begin gas production from2016-17. And instead of putting separate gas processing and transportation facilities, ONGC is looking to hire RIL's under-utilised gas gathering station at KG-D6 fields along with pipelines that take the fuel to onland as also its processing plant at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, ONGC chairman and managing director Sudhir Vasudeva said in Mumbai on Sunday.  &amp;quot;We have started talking to them on that...they (RIL) are open to that,&amp;quot; Vasudeva said. &amp;quot;It makes lot of economic sense to share the infrastructure.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp; RIL has pipeline and other offshore and onshore facilities capable of handling gas output of 80 million standard cubic metres per day. It is however producing just around 26 mmscmd from the KG-D6 lock which is way below the peak production of 61.5 mmscmd reached in March 2010. &amp;quot;It makes sense to all of us. Their (RIL) facilities are lying redundant and we are in need of infrastructure to produce our gas,&amp;quot; Vasudeva said. RIL has indicated that KG-D6 production may not touch 80 mmsmcd due to unexpected geological complexities. &amp;quot;Once we have a clear indication of what capacities RIL can offer, we will firm up our plans,&amp;quot; he said. Globally, oil companies share infrastructure to cut costs on transmission of gas and crude. ONGC has found 4.85 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in nine gas discoveries it has made in the Krishna-Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/2.  &amp;quot;The block is targetted for production by 2016-17 and a peak production of 22 mmscmd is envisaged,&amp;quot; Vasudeva said. Gas from these is proposed to be produced by combining them with a gas discovery in the adjacent block, he said. G-4 gas discovery in a neighbouring block is planned to be developed along with finds in the Northern Discovery Area of KG-DWN-98/2.  Once the government approves the commercial viability of the finds, ONGC will make a formal field development plan (FDP) outlining the specifics of producing gas from the find.  The Northern Discovery Area (NDA) consists of the Padmawati, Kanakadurga, Annapurna, D/KT, U, A, W and E gas finds in in water depths ranging from 594 metres to 1,283 metres. The Southern Discovery Area (SDA)&amp;amp;nbsp;consisting of the UD-1 discovery falls in ultra-deepwater with a depth of 2,841 metres.  He said ONGC has time till November 2013 to apprise the discoveries. The firm plans to drill eight wells to appraise or re-ascertain the commerciality of the finds - six in NDA and two in SDA. The appraisal has begun, he said.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;We are in the process of hiring a rig.

Below is Goyal's response. Sandeep Rao: Can you suggest stocks for one-year investment? A: LIC Housing Finance is in long term uptrend and have corrected to decent levels. It can be bought for a one-year perspective. Its financials are also supportive particularly studying last five years trend. FMCG stocks have also outperformed the benchmark indices and may be bought in dips, like ITC, HUL and Dabur. Among the banking stocks, Indusind Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank can be bought for long term.&amp;amp;nbsp;Kiran Pratapsinh Kadam: Can I buy Reliance Industries at current levels? A: Reliance Q2FY13 results have been disappointing and have led to the recent fall. It has support near 760 levels. Buying near support levels is likely to give returns in near term.&amp;amp;nbsp;Harsimran Singh: What is your view on Steel Authority of India (SAIL)? A: SAIL is showing weak trend in long term. Steel sector in general is also showing weakness due to sluggish economy. My advise is buying should&amp;amp;nbsp;be deferred for now.&amp;amp;nbsp;Manan Maheshwari: What about State Bank of India? A: SBI's NPA have been a matter of concern in the last quarterly results. This may also continue in this quarter and hence post Q2 results, if it disappoints the market, selling may be seen. Fresh buying&amp;amp;nbsp; should be considered only above 2365 levels or in dips near 2100-2050 levels.&amp;amp;nbsp;Manjunath Ramachandra: Is Bharti Airtel a 'buy' now? A: Bharti Airtel has been seeing a decline in subscribers since last 10 years which is not a good indicator for growth. Along with this, telecom sector is impacted by government policies. The recent one being imposing a one-time fee on mobile operators holding spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz. Technically too, buying may be seen only above 285 levels.&amp;amp;nbsp;Chandrayee Sarkar: What is your one-year view on HDFC Bank? A: With consistent fundamental performance by the bank, we feel it can reach target of 750 in one year. Shramnesh Jain: What is your three-month view on Jaiprakash Associates and Tata Motors? A: JP Associate's Q1FY13 results had not impressed the market. Particularly the decline in sales volume had affected the net profits. Technically it is showing strength, however, upside seems to be limited till 100 level. Considering the slow pace in economy Q2 results are also likely to be impacted. Tatamotors also the same case. It had seen decline in sales volumes in Q1FY13 and profit margins were also hit. For both stocks , we recommend caution in medium term.&amp;amp;nbsp;Devabrata Patra: Can I buy Reliance Capital at current price? A: Yes it can be bought at current levels, for likely target of Rs 860. Keep strict stoploss below Rs 780.&amp;amp;nbsp;Sweta Das: What is your call on Axis Bank?

No comment was available from Reliance. &amp;quot;Canadian heavy oil mostly likely Cold Lake came in a combi cargo with Ecuador's Oriente grade,&amp;quot; said one of the sources. He said the price of the Canadian heavy oil bought from PetroChina is linked to Dubai. Reliance processed eight new crudes for the first time in the last fiscal year ending March 31, as it always looks for economical feedstock, the company said in its annual report for 2011-12 which is posted on its website.

This system had come in for sharp criticism from even the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which said it incentivised companies by going on investing in oil and gas fields.  &amp;quot;We have found it too difficult (to manage) the issue of cost recovery,&amp;quot; DGH R N Choubey told reporters at the Petrotech 2012 conference when asked about the provisions of the existing PSC. &amp;quot;It is difficult to assess the cost recovery and to assess the investment multiples and so on and so forth. We have found it difficult.&amp;quot; The existing model of PSC has come in for criticism following a sharp dip in output from RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 gas fields. RIL has already recovered most of its investment from revenues earned from sale of natural gas even as output fell short of the targets.  The government is now trying to punish the firm by restricting its cost recovery by over USD 1 billion. DGH, the upstream nodal arm of the Oil Ministry, favoured moving to a system where companies would be asked to bid for the share of oil and/or gas they would offer to government. The highest bidder would get the right to explore and produce. This way the government will be guaranteed its minimum take at all levels of production and it would not have to bother with monitoring of cost and its recovery.  &amp;quot;There is a limit up to which you can improve the functionality of the existing PSC...because it is a signed contract so there is a limit. You cannot simply throw out everything,&amp;quot; Choubey said. &amp;quot;There is a limit up to which its functionality can be improved.&amp;quot; The government in May appointed a committee headed by C Rangarajan, Chairman of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, to review terms of the contracts signed by companies to explore and produce oil and gas and recommend necessary modifications for the future PSCs.  The Rangarajan Committee, to which DGH is also a member, would submit its report by the month end, Choubey said. The panel has been asked to suggest &amp;quot;structure and elements of the guidelines for determining the basis or formula for the price of domestically produced gas, and for monitoring actual price fixation.&amp;quot; "

QoQ net profit up by 20% to Rs.53.7bn on back of higher refining volumes, weaker rupee and higher other income Company reported healthy GRM of &amp;amp;#36;9.5/bbl v/s &amp;amp;#36;7.6/bbl in Q1 FY13 and &amp;amp;#36;10.2/bbl in Q2FY12, mainly on the back of refinery outages, particularly in Japan, China and Taiwan leading to tighter market and hence stringer cracks Petchem EBIT surprise positively at Rs.17.4, flat QOQ, due to increase in sales volumes which offset decline in product margins. KG D6 prod. at 28.5mmscmd, continued the declining trend Going ahead we remain cautious on refining and petchem cycle on the back of weak demand and/or new capacity additions. Sequentially, GRMs for RIL improved to &amp;amp;#36;9.5/bbl v/s &amp;amp;#36;7.6/bbl, mainly on the back of refinery outages, particularly in Japan, China and Tiwan leading to tighter market and hence stronger cracks. And the same has been reflected in bench mark Singapore GRMs at US&amp;amp;#36;9.1 for Sep12Qtr up from US&amp;amp;#36;7.1/bbl in JuneQtr12. Spread between light-heavy crude oil decreased QoQ. During Sep12Qtr Arab Light Arab Heavy crude oil differential was at US&amp;amp;#36;0.8bbl (US&amp;amp;#36;2.5bbl in June12Qtr) and Dubai-Arab Heavy differential at US&amp;amp;#36;0.6/bbl (US&amp;amp;#36;1.4/bbl in June12Qtr). Refinery throughput for Sep12Qtr stood at 17.6mntons as against 17.3mntons in June13Qtr. Exploration and ProductionRIL has lined up various initiatives for KG D6 for increasing upstream production in future. Company has submitted revised FDP for D1/D3, however the revised FDP for MA field (D 26) was recently approved. Going ahead RIL would file an integrated development plan taking into account an integrated view of D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 fields, the MA field and discoveries in satellite/R Series. It is expected to file the integrated FDP in H2 FY13. Incrementally it would be the integrated plan which would give an idea of what to expect in terms of gas reserve and production level. However actual production would take around 2years. Outlook and ValuationWhile the concerns on declining gas production in KG basin have remained, RIL stock has moved up by 15% and out performed broader market by 5% in the last 3 months. We maintain our outlook of weak refining cycle going ahead on the back of higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. Recently GRMs have gained support from refining mothballing in US and Europe and outages, particularly in Japan, China and Taiwan leading to tighter market and hence stronger cracks. However we suspect the sustainability of such support. Structurally, refining cycle is expected to remain weak with incremental net refining capacity additions expected to the tune of 1mbpd/1.3mbpd in 2012 / 2013, as against demand growth of 0.8mbpd / 1mbpd. In case of petchem, demand remains a concern and any weakness in demand could impact any sustained recovery in margins. With the likelihood of gas production declining further, the stock is likely to remain weak and under-perform going ahead. On the E&amp;amp;amp;P although RIL has lined up several initiatives across various fields/blocks, they are contingent upon government approvals. We would closely watch the government stance towards RIL&rsquo;s initiatives and any speeding up of approvals would be a positive move. However in the short to medium term, RIL&rsquo;s gas production from KG basin is expected to decline. We factor in average gas production of 30/25mmscmd for FY13/14. We remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of new capacities and/or weakening demand. The stock currently trades at FY14E PE multiple of 12.5x and 1.6x P/Bv.

RIL has repeatedly told the oil ministry that the contract which it signed with the state did not have any scope for auditing the performance of the field by the CAG. Sources said RIL had on September 18 written to the Oil Ministry saying it was open to financial audit of its spending on the field, which has seen production drop by over 55 per cent to 27.5 million standard cubic meters per day instead of rising to planned 80 mmscmd, but emphasised that CAG did not have powers to audit a private company. RIL said CAG's 2009 audit, which it had agreed to as a one-time exception, turned out to be a 'performance' audit which was contrary to the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The PSC provides for checking of the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits but not questioning efficacies of processes or technology used in the complex deepsea operations. The CAG had in its first round of audit questioned the 'reasonableness' of costs incurred in the gas field development and said the government should revisit the profit sharing mechanism. CAG, in the second round, is to audit spending made by RIL during 2008-09 and 2011-12. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Analysts who met the management yesterday post the result announcement say that still there is no clarity production ramp-up at KG-D6 due to technical and bureaucracy related issues. Also, due to seasonality of refining trends, brokerages are little cautious on the near-medium term outlook on the company. However, pace of capacity additions and price/demand environment will be deciding factors going ahead. Have a look on how brokerages view RIL stock post Q2 earnings. Antique Broking has assigned a 'hold' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 820. The firm states that RIL's upstream plans are subject to government approval and gas pricing regime and could be an overhang on the stock. The brokerage also sees limited upside in gross refining margins, a major revenue churner for the company. &amp;quot;We estimate GRMS to average at USD 8.5 /bbl for FY13,&amp;quot; it adds.  HSBC has cut RIL to 'underweight' with a target price of Rs 800 from 'neutral' on grounds that the energy conglomerate is unlikely to sustain a sudden jump in refining margins to USD9.5/bbl. The firm further says that RIL could meet market expectation only due to a rebound in refining margins and treasury gains from its huge cash pile which bolstered profits. Citi Research has given a 'neutral' rating to the stock with a target price of Rs 847. The firm further says volume growth in near term is likely to remain subdued as the company's new projects are three years away. There is also no clarity on exploration and production segment due to pending government approvals and non-clarity on pricing. &amp;quot;Earnings upside will, therefore, need to be margin-led which appears unlikely in all of RIL's business verticals,&amp;quot; it states. Angel Broking expects to the stock to remain muted in near term. &amp;quot;Guidance on KG-D6 production and increase in gas price would be key catalysts, going ahead,&amp;quot; it states."

It wants to feed India's burgeoning energy demand.  &amp;quot;We are evaluating various options... we are assessing where is the best gas we can bring from,&amp;quot; Haywood said on the sidelines of Petrotech 2012 conference here. &amp;quot;We are committed to sustainable gas supply to India.&amp;quot; BP is currently developing a huge LNG project in Indonesia named Tangguh, where it aims to produce around 7.6 trillion feet of LNG sourced from six offshore fields. India Gas Solutions Pvt Ltd, BP's equal joint venture with RIL, has already been incorporated and will focus on gas sourcing and marketing, development of infrastructure for transportation and marketing of gas within the country. Haywood did not say if BP-RIL combine may look at putting up a LNG import facility or would prefer to lease capacity in one or more the existing terminals for its imports. Last month, BP India head Sashi Mukundan had stated that the joint venture &amp;amp;nbsp;would finalise investment plans for downstream gas sector in 2013.  Among the options before BP-RIL are setting up a fixed inland LNG import facility or a floating terminal off the east or west coast, or buying stake in existing and upcoming LNG terminals. Haywood said BP was already in discussions for supply of gas to Indian consumers, but did not elaborate. Asked about natural gas pricing in India, he said domestic rates should be such that it can stimulate investments. Most of the domestically produced natural gas, including that of RIL-BP's eastern offshore KG-D6 fields, is priced at USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit, a rate which many in the industry now consider sub-market.  BP and RIL have been seeking revision in KG-D6 price, which the government had in 2007 fixed for first five years of production. KG-D6 field began production in April 2009."

Refinery expansion was not part of the plans Ambani had outlined to company shareholders on June 7. Fountain said RIL was also &amp;quot;looking at (refinery) configuration&amp;quot; to produce more value added products.

RIL is setting up a USD 4 billion petroleum coke gasification project that will produce synthetic gas that will replace expensive LNG as fuel at the refinery. &amp;quot;We are adding significant project of petroleum coke gasification,&amp;quot; he said. India's oil refining capacity will rise 24 per cent to about 267 million tonnes by 2015-16. These plans do not include RIL expansion.

India has 25 oil refineries with a crude oil processing capacity of 215.066 million tonne. This will rise to 264.966 million tonne by 2015-16 as fuel demand grows. Diesel consumption grew by 7.8 per cent in 2011-12 and by 10.2 per cent in the first quarter of current fiscal. This does not take into account the possible expansion by RIL.

Brokerages on an average expect net profit of the company to decline 6 percent Year-on-Year to Rs 5,365 crore, but the same is likely to grow by 20 percent quarter-on-quarter.  Net sales are seen going up by 20.3 percent YoY to Rs 94,500 crore up by 2.9 percent QoQ.  What will drive earnings for RIL?RIL's gross refining margin (GRM)--the difference between the cost of processing crude and the revenue from selling finished petroleum products--is expected to rise anything between USD 9-9.5/bbl versus USD 7.6/bbl,QoQ and USD 10.1/bbl,YoY. Rise in GRMS will help offset comparatively weaker margins from RIL's petchem and exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) business. Not only higher GRMs, even the depreciating Rupee and higher other income will boost results says brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher which further expect the company's petrochemical segment to see some inventory destocking during the quarter. The firm also points out the gas output from RIL's KG-D6 basin will decline to 28 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd), from 37.8 mmscmd, YoY. Antique broking re-iterates that the company's earnings will rise on better GRMs which will strengthen at least by 36%,QoQ to over USD 9/bbl. The firm expects RIL's PAT to grow 17% to Rs 5200 crore, QoQ due to uptick in refining margins.  ICICI Securities says segment profit from RIL's petrochemicals business is expected to remain flat, QoQ. Falling gas output KG-D6 field will impact revenue and profitability of the company's E&amp;amp;amp;P business.  Religare points out that petrochemical margins will remain muted during the quarter on lacklustre demand, primarily from China, with an inventory build-up at the producers' &amp;amp;nbsp;end.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;An increase in naphtha prices and cheaper exports from the US made matters worse for naphtha crackers in Europe and Asia,&amp;quot; notes the firm. Motilal Oswal also expects RIL to deliver strong Q2 earnings led by higher GRMs. However, it also points out refining margins have again started to weaken. Also core businesses of RIL( Petchem and E&amp;amp;amp;P) remain volatile. KR Choksey has also predicted RIL to give a muted performance during the quarter. The firm states that the overall improvement in refining environment particularly expansion in middle distillates would likely enable RIL to clock in better refining margins at around &amp;amp;#36;9.8/bbl when compared with &amp;amp;#36;7.6/bbl QoQ.

The panel takes up clearances of blocks that have been pending for a long time. The government had in nine rounds of New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP), since 1999, awarded 254 blocks to domestic and overseas explorers. Of these, 52 blocks are stuck for want of clearances, hurting the nation's plan to expedite exploration of oil and gas to cut its ballooning import bill. &amp;quot;We have been clearing blocks and I believe only 11-12 blocks are pending for clearances now,&amp;quot; Chaturvedi said. Till August, 52 blocks awarded under various rounds of NELP bidding were pending for clearance by different organisations such as Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Environment and Forest, international boundary disputes and state governments. Of the blocks awaiting clearances, 22 were of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and 15 belong to Reliance Industries. Australian BHP Billiton's five blocks, three of Cairn India, two of Santos International and one each of British Gas, BP, Focus Energy, ENI of Italy and Jubilant Oil and Gas were stuck. Chaturvedi said out of 52 blocks, clearances were pending in respect of 43 blocks from Ministry of Defence due to deference related issues. Most of these have now been cleared. &amp;quot;Efforts have been made to get necessary clearances through meetings with concerned ministries/departments. Efforts are on to get clearances in respect of remaining blocks,&amp;quot; he said. Explorers led by RIL have so far invested about &amp;amp;#36;20.19 billion in oil and gas hunt in blocks awarded under NELP. So far, 113 oil and gas discoveries under NELP have been made in 38 blocks. Under NELP, about 737 million tonnes of oil equivalent hydrocarbons reserves have been added. India's crude oil import bill jumped 48% to Rs 672,220 crore in 2011-12. The nation imported 171.7 million tonnes of crude oil in 2011-12, up from 163.6 million tonnes imported in the previous year for Rs 455,276 crore.

The company has filed revised field development plans for the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields as well as D-26 MA oil and gas field - the only producing areas among a total of 19 oil and gas discoveries made in KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Sources said the company has scaled down capex in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields to USD 5.928 billion from USD 8.836 billion two-phase spending it had proposed in 2006. RIL has already spent USD 5.693 billion on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, that began producing gas in April 2009, and plans to invest a further USD 235 million in raising gas compression capacity. Sources said in the revised field development plan (FDP) for MA field, RIL has scaled down the investment by USD 276 million to USD 1.96 billion. RIL had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion in developing the MA discovery which began producing oil in September 2008 and gas in April 2009. A government-controlled panel, called the Management Committee, for approved the MA field's revised plans, wherein the operator (RIL) will drill one gas well and convert two oil wells into gas wells to raise output over the next 2-3 years. RIL has so far drilled six wells on the MA oilfield. But it had to shut two out of them due to high water and sand ingress, leading to drop in output from over 8 million cubic metres per day three years ago to just over 5 mmcmd currently. Sources said RIL in the revised FDP for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has stated that the remaining reserves in the fields do not justify drilling of any more wells and the additional USD 235 million spending would be for raising gas compression capacity. In the 2006, it had proposed to drill a total of 31 wells capable of producing 80 mmcmd of gas by 2012. However, RIL has so far drilled only 22 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3. Out of these only 18 have so far been put on production while the last four drilled in 2011 have not been connected to production system as they contain uneconomical reserves. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 are producing over 21 mmcmd of gas, down from 53-54 mmcmd achieved in March 2010. The output fell as high water and sand ingress shut six out of the 18 wells. RIL believes that the field has not behaved as predicted and so indiscriminate drilling would be a big drain on cost, they said adding the investment downgrade follows only 3.10 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas reserves remaining in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 instead of 10.03 Tcf estimated in the 2006 plan. RIL believes gas reserves lie in the satellite finds around D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and wants to develop them quickly to produce up to 30 mmcmd of additional gas."

Below are Damani&rsquo;s views on stock queries investors asked us on our Facebook page. Paras Khatri: Which stocks would you recommend for the long-term? A: I would recommend Banking stocks such as ICICI, Axis Bank and SBI for the long term.&amp;amp;nbsp; I would also recommend infra stocks such as IL&amp;amp;amp;FS Transport and Techno Electric.&amp;amp;nbsp; Bajaj Electric, Nesco and Ashiana Housing are good stocks for long term investors. Vijay Bhanushali: What is your call on Reliance Industries? A: In the short term I see it in the 780 to 880 range.&amp;amp;nbsp; In the long-term I think it will head to 960 as refining margins improve over time. Neeraj Bafna: What is your view on Shree Renuka Sugars? A: Renuka can be bought by investors who can hold it for at least a year with a target of Rs 57 and a stop loss of Rs 32.3.&amp;amp;nbsp;I think the sugar cycle should turn in Renuka's favor while its Brazilian operations seem to be bottoming out.&amp;amp;nbsp;Renuka's high debt levels remains a concern and I would advise investors to buy EID Parry if they are keen on the sugar sector. Gaurav Arora: What about Kingfisher Airlines? A: I would stay away from this company as I don't have any clarity on when the operations will restart and how many planes will be available for operations. I believe that it will be difficult for the airline to rope in a foreign investor on favorable terms. Parth Shroff: What is your call on Larsen and Toubro? A: I think Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro is a good stock for long term investors who are already holding the stock.&amp;amp;nbsp; For traders or new investors I would advise to wait for a dip below Rs 1500 to enter the stock.&amp;amp;nbsp; Short term traders can look to sell L&amp;amp;amp;T above 1680 with a stop loss of Rs 1720.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Priscilla Grihapathy: Is IndusInd Bank a 'buy' at current levels? A: No I think the stock will be a good buy below Rs 345 Parasram Kolekar: What about Tata Motors? A: I think Tata Motors will trade in a range of Rs 243 to 305.&amp;amp;nbsp; I would look to buy closer to the low end and sell above 300. Sumant Murarka: What is your call on DLF? A: I would stay away from the stock due to corporate governance issues.&amp;amp;nbsp; I think it will trade between 205 - 260 in the medium term.&amp;amp;nbsp; Nesco and Sobha Developers are better picks from the real estate sector. Shibu Kola: How will Gujarat State Petronet (GSPL) trade in October? A: I can't provide such a short term outlook.&amp;amp;nbsp; The broad trend in the stock is positive. Investors can buy below Rs 77 and hold for a target of Rs 95.&amp;amp;nbsp; The stop loss will be below Rs 71. Zameer Da: What is your view on Lanco Infra? A: I would prefer other power stocks such as NHPC or Tata Power over Lanco Infra.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  Aatish Sanghvi: What should I do with Praj Industries? A: I would sell it off or wait for a rally towards Rs 58 and then sell the stock.&amp;amp;nbsp; You would be better off my investing the money in other infra or power names as mentioned above. Joel Peter Lobo: What about Canara Bank and NTPC? A: Canara Bank is looking good along with the entire banking sector.&amp;amp;nbsp; It has a target of Rs 470. NTPC will remain in a narrow range of Rs 158 to Rs 180 until coal supply issues are sorted out so that it can aggressively expand its generation capacity. Mohit Goyal: What is your call on Mahindra Satyam? A: I think traders can book profits in Mahindra Satyam while long term investors can sell half their shares at current levels.&amp;amp;nbsp; They should get a chance to buy the stock below Rs 100. Karan C Parnami: What is your one-month target for Punjab National Bank? A: PNB should trade in the Rs 770 - 860 range in the next month. Rajesh Anand: What about ICSA? A:&amp;amp;nbsp; I don't have any view on the stock.&amp;amp;nbsp; The corporate governance and business position are questionable.&amp;amp;nbsp; I would recommend investors to stick to other infra or power stocks I mentioned above.

According to the research firm, recent diesel price hike and limiting subsidized LPG cylinders will reduce under-recoveries. However, FY13 estimated under-recoveries remain high at INR1.6t (+14% YoY) v/s INR1.4t in FY12. GRM up 36% QoQ, but YTD, both oil and GRM down 5% : Brent average crude price for 2QFY13 was marginally up 1% QoQ to USD110/bbl. However, volatility was high, led by Eurozone uncertainty, geopolitical developments, and QE3. Brent, after hitting a low of USD89/bbl in June-12, again rose to high of USD116/bbl in mid-Aug, before settling at current levels of USD111/bbl. Similar to oil, product cracks also were volatile with regional benchmark, Reuters Singapore GRM averaging USD9.1/bbl v/s USD6.7/bbl in 1QFY13. Unless meaningful refinery closures happen, we expect margins to remain subdued as global utilization is likely to remain low led by lower demand and commissioning of new refineries. Petchem spreads subdued: In 2QFY13, polymer spreads over naphtha are down 7-8% QoQ, while integrated polyester spreads are down 2-4% QoQ. However, YoY, PE spreads are up 24% and PP spreads 7%. Polymer margins seem to have bottomed out and are expected to slowly recover, contingent on the global economic growth. Lower LPG losses help QoQ drop in under-recoveries: We estimate 2QFY13 underrecoveries at INR390b, down 18% QoQ, primarily helped by lower LPG losses due to lower international prices. As the recent government decision to increase diesel price by INR5/ltr and limit subsidized LPG cylinder was effected on 13 September 2012, the meaningful positive impact of the same will be seen in subsequent quarters. Subsidy sharing would be again ad hoc as in the previous years, and it will be finalized in the last quarter. We model upstream sharing at 40% and downstream sharing at nil/8% for FY13/FY14, with the balance being the government's share. Valuation and view: Recent diesel price hike and limiting subsidized LPG cylinders will reduce under-recoveries. However, FY13 estimated under-recoveries remain high at INR1.6t (+14% YoY) v/s INR1.4t in FY12.

But the same is likely to grow by 20 percent quarter-on-quarter. Net sales are seen going up by 2.9 percent QoQ and 20.3 percent YoY to Rs 94,500 crore in the July-September quarter of 2012. Gross refining margin is expected to be at USD 9-9.5 a barrel in the quarter gone by as against USD 7.6 a barrel in the previous quarter and USD 10.1 a barrel in a year ago period. Investors should watch out for following factors: Brent crude prices averaged at USD 110 a barrel, a rise of 1% over previous quarter. Brent crude hit a low of USD 89 a barrel in June and then rose to USD 116 a barrel in mid-August but settled near USD 111 a barrel. So some inventory gains are also expected. SCRMs (Singapore Complex Refining Margins) averaged at USD 9.13 a barrel in the September quarter as against USD 6.65 a barrel in previous quarter. The improvement in GRMs on quarter-on-quarter basis is led by improvement in diesel, kerosene, petrol and naphtha spreads. Petrochemicals spreads were almost stable QoQ. The gas production from its KG-D6 basin is expected to average at around 28 mcmd as against 32 mcmd QoQ, say experts. Higher other income due to high cash levels and weak rupee is going to support the bottomline of July-September quarter."

An equal status for power plants can be considered as we give to fertiliser,&amp;quot; he said. With KG-D6 output dipping to 27.5 million standard cubic meters per day instead of rising to projected 80 mmscmd, a pro-rata cut in supplies has been effected on 25 power plants which had originally been allocated 28.90 mmscmd of gas.

LPG manufacturing plants got 2.6 mmscmd of gas while the remaining 9.3 mmscmd was prorated among 25 power plants.

Meanwhile, Power Ministry has also asked the companies not to set up any new gas-based projects till 2015, due to scarce availability of the fuel.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; To overcome the situation, some private power producers have demanded that price of domestic natural gas be pooled or averaged out with high cost imported LNG so that a levelised and affordable price of gas is available.

Natural gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields and MA oil field in the Bay of Bengal KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block has slid to about 26 million standard cubic meters per day from 61.5 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. &amp;quot;It (production) will keep coming down,&amp;quot; Chaturvedi said. &amp;quot;We are convinced that in a do-nothing scenario, production will keep coming down.&amp;quot; RIL executive director PMS Prasad and BP India head Sashi Mukundan had in July met oil minister S Jaipal Reddy for nearly three and half hours to highlight the exigency facing the flagging KG-D6 fields due to his ministry not approving annual budgets and capital spending for three years.RIL-BP at the meeting had said output at KG-D6 will continue to fall in absence of interventions needed to revive some of the seven wells that had been shut due to water and sand ingress. Chaturvedi said through the annual investments were agreed upon in an Oil Ministry-controlled block oversight committee in August, the resolutions reflecting them haven't been signed due to certain issues. The oil ministry wants RIL to give Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) access to its books for conducting audit as a precondition for allowing future capitalexpenditure in the block.  RIL says it is ready for any financial audit by CAG but will not agree on a performance audit, wherein technical decisions like selection of a particular technology or vendor for the complex deepsea operations may come in for questioning by a non-technical authority. It says CAG is not authorised to do a performance audit either under the Act it was formed or under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).  &amp;quot;We have told (RIL) that the audit will be under Section 1.9 of the PSC,&amp;quot; Chaturvedi said. Section 1.9 provides for audit of charges and credits by a government auditor. BP in a statement on July 18 stated that it had attendeda joint meeting convened by the ministry on July 13 but refuted reports of a potential KG-D6 production shut-in. RIL holds geological uncertainties as well as high water and sand ingress in wells for the fall in production and hadat the beginning of the current fiscal projected an output of 27.6 mmscmd for 2012-13. This, as per its own projections, was to further dip to 22.6 mmscmd in 2013-14 and then to 20.4 mmscmd. "

RIL in August submitted a revised field development plan (FDP) for the Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3), the only producing gas fields among a total of 18 gas discoveries made so far in the KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal, sources with direct knowledge of the development said. The company, which had in 2006 proposed an investment of USD 8.836 billion in two-phases on the fields, in the revised FDP has outlined a further investment of only USD 235 million over and above USD 5.693 billion that has already been spent. Sources said RIL in the revised FDP submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has stated that the remaining reserves in the fields do not justify drilling of any more wells and the additional USD 235 million spending would be for raising gas compression capacity. Also Read: Reliance Industries tanks on Morgan Stanley downgrade In the 2006, it had proposed to drill a total of 31 wells capable of producing 80 million standard cubic metres per day(mmscmd) of gas by 2012. However, the company has so far drilling only 22 wells on the fields. Out of these only 18 have so far been put on production while the last four drilled in 2011 have not been connected to production system as they contain uneconomical reserves. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 are producing less than 22 mmscmd of gas, down from 53-54 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. The output fell as the company shut six out of the 18 wells due to high water and sand ingress. RIL, which according to the 2006 approved FDP was to drill the 31 wells by end of March 2011, believes that the field has not behaved as predicted and so indiscriminate drilling would be a big drain on cost. The Oil Ministry had, however, seen non-drilling of the committed wells as a violation under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and slapped a notice disallowing over USD one billion in cost as a penalty. Together with about 5.5 mmscmd of output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 output is around 27.5 mmscmd currently. Sources said investment downgrade follows only 3.10 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas reserves remaining in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 instead of 10.03 Tcf estimated in the 2006 plan. RIL, which is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, believes gas reserves lie in the satellite finds around D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and wants to develop them quickly to produce up to 30 mmscmd of additional gas. RIL, DGH and the oil ministry have been under attack for raising capex estimates for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields from USD 2.4 billion proposed in the initial FDP in 2004 to USD 8.836 billion in the final and approved FDP of 2006. This higher investment was justified by projections of output doubling to 80 mmscmd from 40 mmscmd proposed in the initial plan as well as global surge in the devolvement cost of the deepwater block. RIL had previously secured approval of a government-controlled panel, called Management Committee, for revised FDP for MA oilfield in the KG-D6 block. As part of the revised plan for MA field, RIL will drill one gas well and convert two six oil wells into gas wells on the MA oilfield to raise production over the next two to three years. RIL has so far drilled six wells on the MA oilfield, the only oil discovery among the 19 oil and gas finds the company had made in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Besides producing oil, the field also produces natural gas. But the closure of two out of the six wells due to high water and sand ingress has led to drop in output from over 8 mmscmd three years ago to about 5.5 mmscmd this month. To address the problem, RIL and its partners - BP plc of UK and Niko Resources of Canada, submitted a Revised FDP for MA oilfield in February this year. Sources said in the revised FDP, RIL has scaled down the investment required for developing the MA oilfield by USD 276 million to USD 1.96 billion. RIL had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion in developing the Dhirubhai-26 or MA discovery. Besides gas, the field has also lagged behind targets in oil production. The field, which started production in September 2008, is producing less than half of the estimated peak output of 20,000 barrels of oil per day due to water and sand ingress in wells. Sources said that in the revised plan, capital expenditure at MA field has been estimated at USD 1.96 billion as against a capex of USD 2.234 billion approved in 2006. It is based on reduction in volumes -- oil goes down from 159 million barrels to 122 million barrel and gas from 941 billion cubic feet to 924 bcf. The lower capex includes allocation of USD 111 million for drilling of seventh well on the field and work-overs or maintenance of two existing ones, including the ones currently shut, at the cost of USD 164 million."

RIL in a letter to the ministry said if such an &amp;quot;untenable&amp;quot; policy was allowed it would encourage KG-D6 allottees to sell the cheap gas at higher rates during times like plant shutdowns when they don't need the fuel. &amp;quot;KG-D6 gas has been allocated by Government under gas use policy approved by EGoM specifying, sector priority, plant location and use, whereas to implement the said guidelines, RIL is expected to accept change in sector, location and use from currently allocated end use of KG-D6 gas, and not at the instance of the Government but at the behest of the customer apparently without any reference to or intervention of the government,&amp;quot; RIL wrote. The ministry had on September 21 written to RIL saying a gas swap &amp;quot;parties do not have to approach government for approval.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The swapping guidelines are untenable and cannot be reconciled with existing Gas Use Policy,&amp;quot; RIL wrote. Based on EGoM decisions, customer wise allocations with specific end use and that too at a specified location was made. RIL's Gas Sales and Purchase Agreements (GSPAs) with users reflect the end use of gas and location of the plant. &amp;quot;If implemented, these (swapping) guidelines would render any meaningful monitoring of the end use impossible either by the government or by RIL and result in... Trading of gas allocated,&amp;quot; RIL wrote. As an example, RIL said for a customer used both LNG and KG-D6 gas, the price differential between domestic gas and LNG was so huge that it need not use the gas but simply give it to another user who uses imported LNG. &amp;quot;Even those allottes who are required to run continuous operating units would divert KG-D6 gas during their low/nil requirement period such as shutdown or maintenance,&amp;quot; RIL said. &amp;quot;If that is the result of the swapping guidelines, in our submission there is no justification whatsoever in continuing to deny contractors (like RIL) the marketing freedom in the domestic market specifically stipulated in New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and the Production Sharing Contract (PSC),&amp;quot; the company said. RIL said the swapping guidelines in effect meant &amp;quot;granting marketing rights, with complete freedom, to the customers and allottees of KG-D6 gas.&amp;quot; The firm added that it was necessary for RIL to uphold the use restriction for D6 customer as the proposed guidelines can lead to KG-D6 allottees &amp;quot;trading&amp;quot; in their allocation."

Cheering up the move, Nageswara Rao, MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO, IDBI Federal Life says that it will ensure greater flow of capital into the industry and attract foreign investors to increase their stake. Echoing a similar sentiment, Deepak Sood, MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO, Future Generali adds that&amp;amp;nbsp; it will have a positive impact on the customer confidence. The move on FDI in pension and insurance will need Parliamentary ratification as they are governed by an act of law and not an executive domain. Meanwhile, Yashwant Sinha panel will scrutinise both Insurance &amp;amp;amp; Pension Bills and will wait for the govt to introduce them in Parliament. Earlier in June this year, the government had made an attempt to push the nine-year-old Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill. The bill&amp;amp;nbsp;which seeks to give statutory status to the pension regulator was put on hold due to the Presidential elections.  This is the second wave of reforms decisions to be undertaken by the government within a month. On September 13, the government had approved the decision of allowing 51 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail, besides relaxing FDI norms for civil aviation and broadcasting sector.  The decision on FDI in retail triggered a major uproar, with some allies and opposition parties launching a massive attack on the government. Trinamool Congress even withdrew support to the government. The Cabinet is also expected to approve 12th Plan and accord international status to five airports.

Also, the firm signed a new agreement to buy more Venezuelan oil for its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat. &amp;quot;PDVSA will supply between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan heavy crude oil to RIL's two refineries in Jamnagar under a 15-year crude oil supply contract,&amp;quot; the statement said. RIL operates twin refineries at Jamnagar with a total refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. Half of its crude diet can be heavy oil.  RIL had in 2008 signed an agreement to buy 150,000 bpd of oil, which was gradually raised to 270,000 bpd at present. Under the new 15-year agreement, the South American country would sell between 300,000 bpd and 400,000 bpd beginning next year. Venezuela is important for RIL as it buys crude oil from the South American nation for its refineries in Jamnagar. The complex refineries of RIL are suitable to process relatively-cheaper Venezuelan crude where margins are high. PDVSA said earlier this month that it plans to raise overall shipments to India to 518,000 barrels a day by 2018. RIL may take up Venezuela's Boyaca 4 block and a separate section in the Ayacucho area of the Orinoco belt for development. Both these areas can produce 200,000 barrels per day (10 million tons a year) each.  &amp;quot;As per the MoU, RIL will explore upstream options for joint participation in heavy oil projects of the Orinoco Oil Belt,&amp;quot; the statement said. RIL would also cooperate with PdVSA by providing technical assistance and sharing its experience of executing large scale projects in areas of offshore upstream, refining and other downstream projects.  &amp;quot;The signing of the contract and MoU marks furtherstrengthening of the long-standing relationship between RIL&amp;amp;nbsp; and PdVSA. RIL and PdVSA also plan to work together on studies of how to update and improve Venezuela's refinery network, as well as PdVSA's plans to tap offshore natural gas reserves, including the long-delayed Mariscal Sucre project, which is due to begin extraction before the end of this year.  RIL was in 2009 supposed to bid with the Indian consortium of ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian Oil Corp and Oil India Ltd for one of the three giant oil blocks Venezuela was offering the auction. It, however, walked out of theconsortium possibly because of delays in bidding. After RIL's exit, OVL-IOC-OIL teamed up with Repsol YPF SA, Spain's biggest oil company, and Malaysia's Petronas to made a successful bid for the massive Carabobo-1 project in Venezuela's Orinoco heavy oil belt. The field, which had about 50 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, can produce a minimum of 400,000 bpd of oil."

Just as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) prepared to begin audit of KG-D6 field spendings in 2008-09 to 2011-12, RIL wrote to the Oil Ministry saying under the CAG Act, the official auditor was &amp;quot;entitled to carry out an audit of central government, the state government or government body or bodies&amp;quot; only. The CAG in the first round conducted a 'performance' audit which is contrary to the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), it wrote on September 18. RIL said it was open to financial audit of its spending on the field, which has seen production drop by over 55 per cent to 27.5 million cubic metres per day instead of rising to planned 80 mmcmd. It was opposed CAG doing a 'performance' audit wherein efficacies of process or technology used in the complex deepsea operations are called in for questioning by a non-technical authority. Stating that it had as a one-time exception agreed to a CAG audit in 2009, RIL said in case the government insists on CAG doing further audit, the same should be done with an assurance that the report will be given only to the ministry (and not to the Parliament as is required under the CAG Act). Also, &amp;quot;all information submitted by contractor (RIL) during the course of the audit be kept and considered confidential and not disclosed to any third party,&amp;quot; it added. The company said CAG can audit 'performance' of DGH or the petroleum ministry, but not a private sector company like RIL which was functioning as a contractor. The PSC provides for the Oil ministry appointing a representative to carry audit the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits. If the CAG is to be that 'representative', &amp;quot;it would be incumbent upon the ministry to invoke the process stipulated in Section 20 of the CAG Act relating to entrusting the CAG with the audit of an entity, the audit of which is not entrusted to the CAG by  or under any law made by the Parliament and provided that the provisions of Section 20 of the CAG Act can be made applicable to the contractor operating under the PSC,&amp;quot; it wrote. As an alternative, RIL suggested appointment of any auditor other than CAG as the government's representative to conduct an audit. The CAG had in its first round of audit questioned the 'reasonableness of costs incurred in the gas field development and said the government should revisit the profit sharing mechanism. ."

If the formula is approved, it would result in a gas price of slightly under &amp;amp;#36;13 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at an oil price of &amp;amp;#36;100 per barrel, it said. &amp;quot;The proposed formula was based on the pricing formula under a contract for long-term import of LNG into India and was universally accepted by arm's length buyers who bid in large numbers in an open price discovery process,&amp;quot; Niko, which holds 10 per cent interest in KG-D6 block, said in its operational review. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent stake while the remaining 30 per cent is held by UK's Bp plc. RIL on September 6 wrote a reminder to A Giridhar, Joint Secretary (Exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas seeking approval of the price. The company wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus &amp;amp;#36;0.26 per mmBtu. At &amp;amp;#36;100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost &amp;amp;#36;12.93 per mmBtu. The formula proposed by RIL is the same at which Petronet LNG LtdBSE 0.22 %, the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer, buys 7.5 million tonnes per annum (30 million standard cubic meters per day) of LNG from RasGas of Qatar. RasGas charges 12.67 per cent of JCC and Petronet, which is headed by Oil Secretary, pays a further &amp;amp;#36;0.26 per mmBtu for shipping the gas in its liquid form (LNG) from Qatar. &amp;quot;We believe gas market demand fundamentals are strong in India, where gas markets have historically been supply constrained,&amp;quot; Niko said. Despite increases in LNG imports and domestic production, the gap between supply and demand in India has remained high and it could grow in the future. &amp;quot;The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the D6 Block states that natural gas must be sold at arm's length prices, with 'arm's length' defined as sales made freely in the open market between willing and unrelated sellers and buyers, and that the pricing formula be approved by the government taking into account the prevailing policy on natural gas,&amp;quot; it said. Niko said RIL in May 2007 discovered an arm's length price for the sale of gas on a transparent basis with a term of three years and accordingly, proposed a gas price formula to the Government. "

The oil-to-textile group headed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani is making a re-entry into the telecommunication business and is being talked as the most aggressive bidder in the November auction of telecom spectrum.  Sitting on a cash-pile of Rs 70,732 crore at the end of the June quarter, RIL was the most notable participant at the pre-bid conference organised by the Department of Telecom (DoT) in the run-up to the auction.  RIL is most likely to put a direct bid, a source privy to the development said. If for some reasons it is unable to make a bid by itself, the company may fund purchase of spectrum by another company and then acquire it. A company spokesperson declined to comment on speculation about the issue.  The company had in 2010 re-entered the telecom space after it acquired Infotel Broadband which had won pan-India spectrum for offering high-speed internet broadband. The pan-India spectrum that RIL holds through InfotelBroadband does not has permission to provide voice calling facility. Any spectrum that does not allow voice calls is not a big revenue earner and so RIL as the next logical step would want to acquire spectrum which it can bundle its high speed mobile broadband service, the source said. The government plans to begin auction of spectrum vacated from cancellation of 122 telecom licenses by the Supreme Court, from November 12. The source said representatives of RIL subsidiary Infotel Broadband have been attended meetings organised by Department of Telecommunications on proposed spectrum auction.  RIL entered in to telecom business by acquiring Infotel Broadband on the day the later won pan-India airwaves frequencies for Rs 12,847.71 crore in 2010. The company has already revealed its plan to use LTE technology for its country wide network deployment but is yet to start its services. Government has plans to auction airwaves frequencies in 1800 Mhz band and 800 Mhz band which are being currently used for GSM and CDMA mobile telephony services respectively. A new player bidding for 1800 will have to pay minimum of Rs 14,000 crore for pan-India services and for 800 Mhz band itis Rs 9,100 crore.  According to auction rules, for 1800 Mhz band, new entrants will be required to bid for minimum of 4 blocks each of 1.25MHz in each service area and for 800 Mhz band it is minimum of 2 blocks each of 1.25MHz in each service area. RIL has plans to provide digital services in key domains of national interest such as education, healthcare, security, financial services, government-citizen interfaces and entertainment. "

India currently has 15 different rates ranging from USD 2.52 per million British thermal unit to USD 6.77 per mmBtu for natural gas produced from domestic fields. The highest rate is roughly half the rate at which the nation imports gas in ships in its liquid form (liquefied natural gas). &amp;quot;Natural gas prices must be determined by market forces,&amp;quot; the 12th Five Year (2012-17) Plan document states. Besides approving price, the government also fixes gas users and allocates quantities, creating hurdles to gas market development.

The company wants to price KGD6 gas at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu from April 1, 2014 when the current approval for current rates expire. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. It also wants to price the gas it plans to produce from coal seams, called coal-bed methane (CBM), from its contract area in Madhya Pradesh according to the same formula, but the Oil Ministry has not approved it despite the company sending almost one-and-a-half dozen reminders. &amp;quot;There is need for clarity on fiscal incentives on exploration of natural gas under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP),&amp;quot; the Plan document said. RIL won the KG-D6 block and Sohagpur CBM area under separate NELP rounds. &amp;quot;Eliminate the uncertainty that has arisen regarding gas pricing for NELP production sharing contracts by implementing a new design of contracts based on the recommendation of the Rangarajan Committee,&amp;quot; the Plan document said listing reforms required in the oil and gas sector. &amp;quot;Appropriate steps should be taken to resolve conflicts in existing contracts where the interpretation of the contract term is open to multiple options,&amp;quot; it added. Besides, it called for incentivising exploration and production of domestic non-conventional fuels like shale gas and CBM. Also, it wanted natural gas/LNG to be given the 'Declared Goods Status' so that a uniform central sales tax can be levied on the environment friendly fuel rather than present practice of varying state VAT. This would lead to uniform price of gas in most of the states, it said."

RIL on September 6 wrote to A Giridhar, Joint Secretary (Exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas proposing to price natural gas it produces from the Krishna Godavari basin block in Bay of Bengal at a rate equivalent to price India pays for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG). The company wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67% of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu, sources with direct knowledge of the development said. The formula proposed by RIL is the same at which Petronet LNG Ltd, the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer, buys 7.5 million tonnes per annum (30 million standard cubic meters per day) of LNG from RasGas of Qatar. RasGas charges 12.67% of JCC and Petronet, which is headed by Oil Secretary, pays a further USD 0.26 per mmBtu for shipping the gas in its liquid form (LNG) from Qatar. RIL said it needs to &amp;quot;achieve financial closure in order to undertake further development activities in the block. Therefore, it is once again requested that approval of the Government to the price formula as proposed... be conveyed to us without further delay.&amp;quot; The company said the price formula it has proposed would apply for all gas produced from KG-D6 block post March 2014. Besides currently producing Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3 gas fields and MA oil field, the formula would also apply to D2, D6, D19 and D22 fields -- the field development plan of which has been approved by the government, it said. The government had in 2007 fixed a price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu for gas from KG-D6 block for first five years of production. KG-D6 fields began production on April 1, 2009 and the current price expires on March 31, 2014. From April 1, 2014, RIL wants the gas to be price at import parity as is done in case of crude oil. Domestic oil producers like state-owned ONGC get import parity or a rate equivalent to international oil price, for the crude oil they produce from domestic fields. &amp;quot;The proposed formula is in full compliance of the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) that mandate that gas must be sold at arms-length prices to the benefit of the parites under the PSC,&amp;quot; RIL President and COO B Ganguly wrote to the Oil Ministry. &amp;quot;Imported LNG in the country constitutes about 35% of gas consumption in the country and this share is expected to progressively increase. Hence long term LNG prices represent the best benchmark for arms-length prices,&amp;quot; he added. "

At this price point, the cost of the proposed towers would as low as one-fortieth of the base stations deployed by some leading mobile phone service providers. These low-cost towers are part of the strategy of country's largest private sector enterprise as it gears up for its foray into telecom space through Infotel Broadband. Industry sources said some leading telecom companies are using telecom towers costing as high as Rs 30-40 lakh, while some of the low-cost towers cost Rs 15-20 lakh. Some Chinese firms, however, claim to have developed telecom towers worth Rs 5-10 lakh. Costs vary as per the volume of the order and transmission capabilities, among other factors, said experts. &amp;quot;Infotel is planning to build its network with a mix of rented mobile towers and its own BTSs (base tower station or mobile towers). The BTSs that Infotel is working on are expected to cost it Rs 1 lakh each,&amp;quot; a source said. A RIL spokesperson declined to comment on the issue. The rentals for telecom towers also varies between Rs 30,000-50,000 per month, making the proposed base stations of RIL group a very cost-effective model, sources said. Besides an estimated one lakh towers of its own, RIL group would also consider leasing out the base stations from third parties, sources aware of the developments said. Infotel is focussing on a low-cost model so that it can keep the rates of 4G telecom services lower than that of other players. The services may be launched as early as 2012-end, but there is more likelihood of launch in 2013. In earlier days, the cost of setting-up of stand-alone BTSs (mobile towers) was Rs 50-60 lakh. With advancement in technology, it has come down to Rs 30-40 lakh for a high quality tower. Infotel Broadband had earlier floated tender for its plans to deploy base stations at around one lakh locations, after which some tower companies offered to rent out their towers. This it would have to share with other telecom companies as well.  The rentals were offered in a wide range of Rs 15,000-50,000 per month, excluding various on-site costs. Infotel is also likely to manage on its own the network, IT infrastructure and other services, which are normally outsourced by telecom operators to keep operational costs low. At present, only Bhart Airtel and state-run telecom company BSNL provide 4G services in the country out of eight firms that hold BWA spectrum. "

Reliance Industries and Cairn India want to drill exploration wells in already producing oil and gas fields, but the ministry's technical arm DGH had previously opined that such activity in an area that is producing hydrocarbons is not permissible under Production-Sharing Contract (PSC). DGH felt the government's profit share, which is triggered when an explorer recovers all his cost, would be adversely impacted if new costs are added. To get around this, the ministry is now formulating a policy to allow cost recovery of an exploration well drilling in a producing field, only in circumstances where it leads to a commercially exploitable find, official sources said. This would be a significant departure from the signed contracts that allow companies to first recover all their costs before sharing profits with the government. Globally, explorers keep drilling exploration wells to replace the reserves that may have been produced. And the new change the government is proposing, is bound to be opposed by operators like RIL. While RIL has proposed to drill an exploration well on the flagging D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block to study reservoir characteristic, Cairn wants to drill new probes to help raise output from the Rajasthan block to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 175,000 bpd. The ministry is in agreement with the operators on the need to drill exploration wells within a producing oil or gas field so as to add more reserves and increase production life but it does not want to take a decision that CAG may tomorrow criticise as causing loss to the exchequer in lower profit petroleum, sources said. Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had sometime back taken a view that exploration is not permitted within an area that has been delineated after discoveries for production of hydrocarbons. As a way out, the ministry wants to frame a new policy for allowing exploration in a development area and will put it up to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for approval, they said. Globally, exploration is permitted in fields that are under production so as to keep adding new reserves to replenish ones that have been produced. In absence of rejuvenation, the fields will terminally decline from the day output starts. The same principal has been followed in fields in Assam and Mumbai offshore. _PAGEBREAK_ Under Production Sharing Contract (PSC), all petroleum operations, be it exploration, production or appraisal well, are cost recoverable - meaning the cost of such investment is first allowed to be deducted from revenues earned from sale of oil/gas and profits split with the government only after that. Cairn believes that production from its prolofic Rajasthan block can reach 300,000 bpd or 15 million tons per annum and has made an application to the government seeking permission to explore within the 3,111 square km mining lease covering 25 oil and gas finds. It has even given up its rights under PSC by proposing that it will not seek recovery of cost of the exploration well unless it is successful ie, results in a commercial discovery. Cost of a dry or no discovery well will be borne by the company. RIL however does not believe in surrendering its rights guaranteed under PSC - that is to recover all exploration and production cost from sale of oil or gas before sharing profits with the government. But to give government the comfort, it has as a one-time exception agreed to drill the exploration well 'MJ1' at its sole risk and recover cost only if the discoveries are assessed to be commercial. Sources said RIL believes that exploration well is clearly allowed in any mining lease area under law and the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) also supports it. Cairn also believes that the PSC defines a development area as one that not just includes a discovery or a group of discoveries but also &amp;quot;area of potential petroleum deposits&amp;quot;. These deposits can only be exploited if exploration is allowed within the mining lease. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields in the east offshore KG-D6 block of RIL have seen output fall from 53-54 million standard cubic metre per day achieved in March, 2010 to 21.93 mmscmd this month. Together with just over 5.53 mmscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 is producing about 27.5 mmscmd. This output is short of 80 mmscmd production level that was envisaged in the field development plan approved in 2006. Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal had on July 6 written to the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking his intervention so that his group firm Cairn India is allowed to explore oil in the prolific Rajasthan block. &amp;quot;The Rajasthan Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and the mining lease have enabling provisions that allow carrying on exploration in development area; however, we have been asked to obtain government approval,&amp;quot; Agarwal, whose group had last year acquired Cairn India, wrote to Prime Minister on July 6. The 3,111 sq km development area was ring-fenced from an exploration area more than three times its size after discoveries were made."

RIL has so far drilled six wells on the MA oilfield, the only oil discovery among the 19 oil and gas finds the company had made in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Besides producing oil, the field also produces natural gas. But the closure of two out of the six wells due to high water and sand ingress has led to drop in output from over 8 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) three years ago to 5.53 mmscmd this month. To address the problem, RIL and its partner BP Plc of UK submitted a Revised Field Development Plan for MA oilfield in February this year, sources privy to the development said. The revised plan envisages drilling of a new gas well and conversion of two sick (or closed) oil wells to gas wells in order to maximise the gas production from the field, they said. Together with 21.93 mmscmd of output from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 or D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas field, the KG-D6 block currently a little less than 27.5 mmscmd of gas. Sources said in the revised field development plan, RIL has scaled down the investment required for developing the MA oilfield by USD 276 million to USD 1.96 billion. RIL had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion in developing the Dhirubhai-26 or MA discovery, the only oil find in KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin off the east coast. Besides gas, the field has also lagged behind targets in oil production. The field, which started production in September 2008, is producing less than half of the estimated peak output of 20,000 barrels of oil per day due to water and sand ingress in wells. Sources said in the Revised Field Development Plan, submitted to the government for approval, capital expenditure at MA field has been estimated at USD 1.96 billion as against a capex of USD 2.234 billion approved in 2006. The RFDP is based on reduction in volumes -- oil goes down from 159 million barrels to 122 million barrel and gas from 941 billion cubic feet (bcf) to 924 bcf. The lower capex includes allocation of USD 111 million for drilling of seventh well on the field and work-overs or maintenance of two existing ones, including the ones currently shut, at the cost of USD 164 million. Sources said RIL-BP would submit a revised development plan for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields, the main producing area in KG-D6, by October. RIL had in the original field development plan for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. Of this, about 60 per cent has been spent so far."

CAG, in a report table in the Parliament today, said ONGC &amp;quot;deviated from the standard tendering procedure and hired a rig viz Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-1 (DDKG-1) from RIL without calling for competitive bids for a period of four years on untenable grounds&amp;quot;. ONGC had in May 2009 hired DDKG-1 from RIL for four years ending July 2013 without calling for competitive bids at an operating day rate of USD 495,000 for first 180 days and at USD 510,000 from 181st day onwards. The effective day rate worked out to USD 563,488. CAG said the company in December 2008 projected a requirement of rig capable of drilling in ultra deep water (water depth of 10,000 feet) by December 2010 to meet its work commitment in exploration block it had won under NELP rounds. &amp;quot;On the plea that no ultra deep water rig was available with it before December 2010, the company (ONGC) hired the rig from RIL,&amp;quot; it said in the report for 2010-11 fiscal. The rig, CAG pointed out, was in fact hired by RIL from Deepwater Pacific-1 Inc in October 2007 for a period of five years commencing July 2009 and ending July 2014. &amp;quot;Upon RIL's willingness (in March 2009) to share the rig with the company (ONGC), the latter obtain the same rig from RIL under a tripartite assignment agreement on the same rates, terms and conditions as were applicable to RIL,&amp;quot; it said. Stating that ONGC did not obtain competitive bids before hiring the rig from RIL, CAG said the state-owned firm had in July 2009 projected &amp;quot;a situation of emergency&amp;quot; to acquire an ultra deep water rig by deviating from the standard tendering procedure of competitive bidding. The company drilled seven ultra deep wells using DDKG-1 rig till December 2010. Of these seven well, three were appraisal wells, drilled to confirm previous finds. &amp;quot;In December 2009, the company (ONGC) itself had expressed its inability to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in committing a definite development plan for these (discovery) wells stating that demonstrable technology implementation analogues were not available in the world in such ultra deep waters. &amp;quot;Hence, in the absence of technology, drilling of these appraisal wells was not crucial to decide their commercial viability by December 2010,&amp;quot; the audit said. CAG said the remaining four wells could have been drilled after December 2010 when another rig - Platinum Explorer was scheduled to be mobilised by ONGC. &amp;quot;Moreover, the Government of India had already granted extension of time to the company to drill these well by March/May 2011 under the rig moratorium policy,&amp;quot; it added. Listing deviations from standard contractual terms, the official auditor said ONGC agreed to pay standby day rate or daily payments when rig was not operating at the rate of 98% of the operating day rate instead of standard terms and condition obliging it to pay at the rate of no more than 95%. &amp;quot;As a result, it had to make extra payment of USD 1,802,005 (Rs 8.11 crore) during July 2009 to October 2011,&amp;quot; it said."

OVL has invested in oil and gas fields in four countries high on US sanction list -- Iran, Myanmar, Syria and Sudan. Of these, its investments in Iran are the ones that is stalling closure of any shale gas deal. Sources said the company has taken legal opinions which warn of consequences like forfeiture of its entire investment in an American or Canadian shale gas property should Washington implement its own law that calls for imposition of sanctions on any firm investing more than USD 20 million in Iran's petroleum or natural gas sector in any given year. OVL has since 2003 invested about USD 87.875 million in Farsi block in Iranian Persian Gulf and has discovered a giant Farzad-B gas field. The field, which holds 12.5 trillion cubic feet of reserves (four times the size of reserves in Reliance Industries eastern offshore KG-D6 fields), may require up to 6 billion in producing 1,100 million standard cubic feet a day by 2016-17.

British firms BG Group, BP and Italy's ENI own one each. Reddy said clearances for larger areas from which these blocks are carved out are obtained from concerned ministries before auctioning them.

The firms have invested USD 12.4 billion for exploration and development activities in the blocks, Reddy told lawmakers in a written reply. The world's fourth biggest oil importer, India wants to tap domestic supply to cut its ballooning import bill and widening fiscal deficit. Its crude oil import bill surged 48% to Rs 672000 crore&amp;amp;nbsp;in the year to March due to rising global oil prices, declining rupee and expanding refining capacity. The economy is growing at its slowest pace in nearly a decade and policy paralysis has stalled major reforms including those on fuel pricing, denting global investors' confidence in the Indian oil sector. In 2010, Brazil's Petrobras and Norway's Statoil exited from a block operated by ONGC in the hydrocarbon-rich Krishna Godavari Basin off India's east coast. India, which imports about 80% of its oil needs, has awarded 249 blocks under nine licensing rounds since 1999. Oil and gas discoveries have been made in 38 blocks."

In absence of rejuvenation, the fields will terminally decline from the day output starts.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The same has been followed in fields in Assam and Mumbai offshore.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Sources said the CCEA would be asked to consider allowing exploration during mining lease and production stage.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Cairn believes that production from its prolofic Rajasthan block can reach 300,000 bpd or 15 million tons per annum and has made an application to the government seeking permission to explore within the 3,111 square kilometer mining lease covering 25 oil and gas finds.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; It has even given up its rights under Production Sharing Contract (PSC) by proposing that it will not seek recovery of cost of the exploration well unless it is successful i.e., results in a commercial discovery.

Sources said RIL believes that exploration well is clearly allowed in any mining lease area under law and the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) also supports it.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Cairn also believes that the PSC defines a development area as one that not just includes a discovery or a group of discoveries but also &amp;quot;area of potential petroleum deposits&amp;quot;.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;These deposits can only be exploited if exploration is allowed within the mining lease.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields in the east offshore KG-D6 block of RIL have seen output fall from 53-54 million standard cubic metre per day achieved in March, 2010 to about 23 mscmd this month. Together with 6 mscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 is producing about 29 mscmd.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; This output is short of 80 mmscmd production level that was envisaged in the field development plan approved in 2006.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal had on July 6 written to the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking his intervention so that his group firm Cairn India is allowed to explore oil in the prolific Rajasthan block.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;The Rajasthan Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and the mining lease have enabling provisions that allow carrying on exploration in development area; however, we have been asked to obtain government approval,&amp;quot; Agarwal, whose group had last year acquired Cairn India, wrote to Prime Minister on July 6.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The 3,111 sq km development area was ring-fenced from an exploration area more than three times its size after discoveries were made.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;As exploration is continuing in other producing blocks in the country, we request government approval for exploration in Rajasthan to enable us to achieve the full production potential,&amp;quot; Agarwal wrote.

RIL's Dubai-based subsidiary Reliance Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production DMCC last month signed agreements to sell 25 per cent interest in producing Block 9 in Yemen to Medco Energi, industry sources said. The stake sale follows billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run firm exiting from two oil blocks in Kurdistan region of Iraq on July 19. RIL had in 2001 won Yemen's Block 9 along with Hood Energy and Calvalley Petroleum Inc. RIL and Hood Energy held 25% stake each while Calvalley had the remaining 50%. Sources said RIL's sale agreement with Medco would be effective from January 1.&amp;amp;nbsp;While the agreement is for a 25% interest, Medco would effectively have a 21.25% participating interest in the block because, under a regulation in Yemen, the contractor of a production-sharing agreement has to accommodate a working interest for the country, which is represented by the Yemen Oil and Gas Company, which will hold a 15% stake. Accordingly, the operator Calvalley Petroleum would have 42.5% interest and Hood Oil 21.25% stake. Block 9 lies covers 2,234 square kilometres in the Sayun-Masila basin in Yemen's Hadramaut province, about 350-km north-east of the Yemeni capital, Sana. It is estimated to hold proven plus probable reserves of 58.6 million barrels of oil. RIL would get another USD 5 million if the block produces 10,000 barrels of oil per day. The block currently produces between 6,000 bpd and 6,500 bpd. A 20 year construction contract was granted over the block by the Yemeni government in 2005 which the joint venture can apply to have extended for a further five years after 2025. After the sale, RIL is left with interest in block 34 and 37 in eastern Yemen where is is investing USD 66 million with its patner Hood. RIL had last month sold its 80% interest in Rovi and Sarta onland blocks in northern Iraq to US oil behemoth Chevron Corp for a reported USD 200 million. The exits are part of the company's overseas asset restructuring wherein it is cutting exposure in exploration blocks to focus on producing properties. After the exit from Kurdistan and Yemen, RIL now is left with a portfolio of 10 overseas oil and gas assets including two each in Peru, Yemen, Oman and Colombia and one each in East Timor and Australia.

Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas RPN Singh told the Lok Sabha in a written reply that RIL had estimated 10.3 Tcf of recoverable reserves in the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas field in the KG-D6 block. &amp;quot;Subsequently, the contractor (RIL) revised the estimates of recoverable reserves of D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields as 3.10 Tcf,&amp;quot; he said. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the biggest of the 18 finds RIL has made in the deep-sea block in Bay of Bengal, had begun production in April 2009 and had produced 2 Tcf of gas during past three years. MA oilfield in the same KG-D6 block was estimated to hold 681.4 Billion cubic feet (Bcf) of recoverable gas reserves and RIL has now revised the numbers to 788 Bcf, he said. Singh said the block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 produced 15.106 bcm of gas in 2009-10 which rose to 20.4 bcm in 2010-11. But in the subsequent year, it fell to 15.611 bcm. The fall in output was because one-third of the 18 gas producer wells in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields &amp;quot;ceased to produce gas due to water/sand ingress in well bores,&amp;quot; he said, adding on MA field, two of the six wells had ceased due to same reasons. &amp;quot;The operator (RIL) has attributed lower gas production as compared to approved plan from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields to unforeseen geological surprises and reservoir,&amp;quot; Singh said. The Directorate General of Hydrocarbon has attributed the fall in output to &amp;quot;non-drilling of the required number of gas producer wells in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields by the contract in line with the Addendum to Initial Development Plan (AIDP),&amp;quot; he said. In the AIDP, RIL had committed to drill 31 wells and produce 80 million standard cubic meters per day of gas by this time of the year. But, output is currently less than 29 mmscmd. "

The matter would now go to Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM), the order said.  Earlier in the day, Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy, who hails from Andhra Pradesh, tried to justify the decision saying it was taken by an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) in 2008.But it was oil ministry which had in 2010 forced RIL to sign contracts for more than the projected output from KG-D6 fields saying pro-rata cut on all customers can be applied in case production lags supply commitments. &amp;quot;There is severe shortage in availability of gas in the case of KG basin.

Faced with an unanticipated sharp decline in KG-D6 gas production, the government had last year ordered a pro-rata cut in supplies to 25 power plants which had an original allocation of 28.90 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd). But there was no cut in the 15.668 mmscmd allocation to 16 fertiliser plants, who were given top priority in gas allocation. Sources said Ratnagiri Gas &amp;amp;amp; Power Pvt Ltd (RGPPL), the firm that now runs the 1,967 MW power plant at Dabhol in Maharashtra, was allocated 7.6 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas. It like other power plants, however, got only 40% of allocated volumes. The Ministry in its July 31 order cited an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) decision of February 24 to order RIL to supply RGPPL 7.6 mmscmd of gas in full, sources said, adding it was not clear what took the ministry over five months to communicate the decision of the ministerial panel. KG-D6 output has fallen to about 29 mmscmd this month, of which just about 12 mmscmd was being supplied to power plants. The supplies to power plant include those to RGPPL. After the ministry's July 31 order, RGPPL will get 7.6 mmscmd, leaving under 5 mmscmd to be divided among the 24 other power plants. KG-D6 gas output has fallen from 61.5 mmscmd in March 2010 to under 29 mmscmd. Of the current output, over 14 mmscmd is sold to fertiliser plants and about 3 mmscmd goes to LPG extraction plants, leaving 12 mmscmd for power plants. Sources said the EGoM in its meeting on February 24 directed supply of full quota of gas to RGPPL after Power Ministry made a request. Power ministry argued that the beleaguered Dabhol power plant after the exit of its bankrupt owner Enron Corp of US, was granted 'top most priority' in allocation of KG-D6 gas at par with the fertiliser sector by the EGoM while making original allocation on October 23, 2008. Following from that decision, no cut should be made in supplies to RGPPL till cuts for the fertliser sector starts, it had argued. According to the power ministry, substantial cuts in the supply of KG-D6 gas to RGPPL has been observed from November 2011, onwards, despite the fact that no cut has been started for the fertiliser sector till date. Sources said Andhra Pradesh has lodged a strong protest against the RGPPL allocation, claiming that this will hurt power plants in the state, as they are already operating at a lower plant load factor (PLF) of 52% as against the 75% PLF mandated by the EGoM."

We would like to call meeting (of the EGoM) as early as possible,&amp;quot; Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy told reporters here. The EGoM was reconstituted last month after its previous head Pranab Mukherjee resigned as Finance Minister to become the President. Antony previously was not part of the EGoM and has been included after Mukherjee's exit.  The Finance Ministry will now be represented by Minister of State for Finance Namo Narain Meena on the EGoM. Besides Antony and Meena, the EGoM includes Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy, Power Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, Fertiliser and Chemicals Minister M K Alagiri, Law and Justice Minister Salman Khurshid and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. RIL has demanded a market price of KG-D6 gas instead of USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit rate fixed for five years ending March 31, 2014. &amp;quot;The EGoM (at its last meeting in February) had directed us to seek an opinion of the Attorney General G E Vahanvati if prices can be revised before the 5-year tenure fixed by the government,&amp;quot; an official said. &amp;quot;We have received the opinion of AG on the price of RIL gas and it will now be put up before EGoM for a decision,&amp;quot; he added. The nation's highest law officer has opined that the contract for KG-D6 does not mandate any fixed period during which the approved price would remain valid. AG felt that revision of prices is advisable or not is a matter which the EGoM would have to determine not as a matter of law, but as a matter of policy. The official said the Oil Ministry will not recommend price change before April 1, 2014. Meanwhile, RIL has submitted a proposal to price KG-D6 gas at import parity from April 2014 and not with immediate effect. The government had in 2007 approved USD 4.205 per mmBtu price for KG-D6 gas for first five years of production. RIL began output from KG-D6 on April 1, 2009. The company, which has seen output halve to less than 30 million standard cubic meters per day in past two years, is seeking market price which will help it deploy deepsea technologies to exploit difficult sections of the reservoir.  India imports liquefied natural gas (LNG) at three times the price fixed for KG-D6 gas and RIL is seeking that price for the eastern offshore fields. The Oil Ministry is, however, opposed to any revision in rates before timeline fixed by the EGoM. "

The Reliance Industry (RIL) results for the Q1 FY 13 have been slightly better than the estimates. 2. There is definite positive surprise on the GRM (Gross Refining Margins). The estimated GRM was about US&amp;amp;#36; 7 per barrel, but the company has posted GRM of US&amp;amp;#36; 7.6 per barrel. That&rsquo;s definitely positive during this quarter. Singapore GRMs during the quarter were about US&amp;amp;#36; 6.6 per barrel. Hence, the Reliance has posted about US&amp;amp;#36; 1 per barrel premium over Singapore GRMS, which is significant premium. Reliance has got such a healthy premium about 3 quarters back. So, this is a definite improvement from the company point of view. 3. One more interesting aspect of the financials is the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; segment. The proportion of &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; has reduced to 35% of the overall Profit Before Tax. This is a reduction from the 42% share in the previous quarter. This indicates that the Quality of Profits has increased in case of Reliance from the Operation Profit point of view. 4. The company has aggressively started the buyback with about Rs 2000 Crores of buyback already completed. Further, one can expect that the company will go more aggressively in the coming quarters with buyback. This can reduce the overall cash balance of the company. Hence, one can expect further reduction of share of Other Income in the future quarters as well. 5. To summarize, in this quarter, Reliance has made more money from refining and less money from Money.

However, as has been the case in the last couple of quarters, analysts expect the company's profit to receive some support from other income, which is largely derived from treasury operations utilizing the excess cash on its books. A consensus of estimates by various brokerages have pegged consolidated net profit to decline around 22% to Rs 4,400 crore,YoY and sales are expected to rise around 5% to Rs 85,300 crore. RIL will report earnings for the June quarter on Friday. Check out CNBC-TV18's estimates on RIL Brokerages say these are the factors which will impact RIL&rsquo;s Q1 numbers &amp;amp;nbsp;*Crude throughput to be approximately 17 million metric tonnes as against 16.8 mmt, YoY. &amp;amp;nbsp;*KG-DG output has averaged at 34 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) from 49 mmscmd, YoY. &amp;amp;nbsp;*Gross refining margins (GRM) or the difference between the cost of crude and the price of refined products is estimated to be around USD 7/bbl versus USD 10.3/bbl, YoY. In its earnings preview note, Bank of America Merill Lynch said: &amp;quot;Our concern is that global economic downturn may hit RIL's GRM and petrochem margins. Thus, the company&rsquo;s earnings may deteriorate in FY13. Weakness in refining and petrochemicals was already visible in 2H FY12,&amp;quot; said the firm. BofaML believes that the improvement in outlook is likely if GRM from coke gasification rises, fundamentals better, gas price is increased, petrochemical capacity is expanded and gas output recovers. &amp;amp;nbsp;The firm sees a 24% YoY fall in RIL&rsquo;s profit in April-June, and 14%YoY decline in annualised earnings per share during the quarter. The company stock has declined 3.5% when compared to the 4% rise in Sensex since Jan 2012. Motilal Oswal and Angel Broking too expect declining KG-D6 output and weak petchem margins to wear down profits for the quarter. Topline, however, would grow marginally because of higher refining and petchem volumes, says K.R Choksey in a note. &amp;amp;nbsp;Independent analyst S.P Tulsian expects a marginal increase of 30-50 bps in GRMs which can surprise markets. He believes the surplus cash of around Rs 70,000 crore which the company has deployed to generate income will boost profits."

Production from KG-D6 had gradually declined to 35mmscmd in 4QFY2012 from 51mmscmd in 4QFY2011.

The Oil Ministry stated that RIL had violated the production sharing contract (PSC) and willfully drilled fewer wells than what it had committed in its approved plan, Amended Initial Development Plan (AIDP). However, RIL had stated earlier that unexpected geology had resulted in lower gas production. Further, RIL maintained that the production sharing contract allows for operators to recover 100% of the capital and operating expenditures on an oil and gasfield and does not link the cost recovery to production. Hence, it has challenged the Oil Ministry's order."

Days before a 60-day deadline for approval of RIL's import parity pricing of gas to be produced from below coal-seams (CBM) expired, the Ministry on July 12 asked the company to explain the fixed component in the pricing formula, sources said. The query on inclusion of USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit in the formula is repeat of what the ministry had asked RIL on April 24. RIL had on February 21 submitted a proposal seeking a price of equivalent to 12.67 per cent of price of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude oil, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, for the CBM it plans to produce from Madhya Pradesh blocks from end-2014. In response to the Ministry's April 24 query, RIL on April 26 sent a detailed 6 page reply stating that the CBM contract provides for pricing the gas at best available arms length rate for similar sales in the region. Sources said RIL stated its proposed formula is exact replica of the rate paid by customers in the region for purchase of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a long term contract. CBM contract provides for approval of the sale price formula within 60 business days &amp;quot;from the date of receipt of proposal or from the date of receipt of clarifications / additional information&amp;quot;. The Ministry's April 24 clarifications pushed back the approval clock by another two months and the same thing has happened with the recent July 12 query. Sources said RIL had in February called for open offers for price discovery according to the formula after informing all the concerned ministeries of power, fertiliser, chemical and petrochemical besides oil. Neither oil ministry nor any other ministry or state government raised any objections to call for offers for price discovery. The delay in the CBM price approval is seriously hampering the development and production of CBM which would annually substitute imported liquid fuels worth about USD 1 billion or substitute USD 650 million of LNG imports, sources said. RIL got a demand of 20.63 million standard cubic meters a day (six times the gas available for sale) in the open bids called in February based on which the company sought approval of the formula."

During 1QFY2013, average Brent crude oil price fell by 8.7% qoq on account of adverse news flow from the troubled Eurozone. Further, average WTI crude oil price decreased by 9.3%, broadly reflecting the fall in Brent crude oil price. Henry Hub natural gas price declined by 5.6% qoq due to rising production of shale gas (thus rising inventories) and warmer summer. However, Asian spot LNG prices continued to remain high on account of demand-supply mismatch in Asia. Prices of petrochemical products, on the other hand, remained flat on a qoq basis during 1QFY2013. During April and May 2012, Indian crude oil basket for oil prices stood at US&amp;amp;#36;118/bbl and US&amp;amp;#36;108/bbl, respectively. Despite INR depreciation against the USD, the steep decline has resulted in lower under-recoveries for oil marketing companies (OMCs) on account of selling diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG at subsidized rates. During the first half of June 2012, OMCs continued to lose Rs 446cr per day compared to Rs 563cr per day in April 2012. OMCs continued to lose Rs 10.2/liter, Rs 30.5/liter and Rs 396/cylinder on diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG, respectively, during the first half of June 2012. Mixed 1QFY2013 performance by O&amp;amp;amp;G stocksDuring 1QFY2013, BSE Oil and Gas (O&amp;amp;amp;G) Index recorded a moderate decrease of 0.5%, although BSE Sensex was positive by 0.1%. After a rise during 4QFY2012, oil and gas stocks again fell during April and May 2012, in-line with the fall in broader markets. However, the stocks increased during June 2012. Cairn India stock fell steeply on June 29, 2012, after Cairn Energy sold its 3.5% stake by way of bulk deal in the open market. RIL stock fell during April and May 2012, but increased in June 2012 due to the ongoing buyback program by promoters. GAIL stock declined during 1QFY2013, reflecting the decrease in KG-D6 gas production and higher international gas prices. ONGC was the outperformer in the oil and gas sector. The stock increased substantially in June 2012, after it posted better-than-expected 4QFY2012 results. 1QFY2013 expectationsFor 1QFY2013, we expect net sales of companies under our coverage to increase broadly, mainly driven by higher volume growth. We expect ONGC's net sales to increase by 20.2% yoy on account of higher realization. ONGC's PAT is expected to increase by 31.4% yoy. For RIL, we expect the top line to decrease modestly by 0.2%. However, its bottom line is expected to decrease by 28.0% yoy mainly due to lower production from KG-D6 block. GAIL is expected to report 20.7% yoy topline growth on account of higher volumes. However, its net profit is expected to decrease by 23.0% yoy due to higher interest and depreciation expenses. Cairn India's net sales are expected to increase by 1.3% yoy; however, its bottom line is expected to decrease by 9.1% yoy.

RIL has sought a price equivalent to imported LNG from April 1, 2014, when the current below-market rate of USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu)&amp;amp;nbsp;expires. &amp;quot;The empowered group of ministers (EGoM) on natural gas pricing and utilisation will decide on the issue,&amp;quot; he said. The EGoM was previously headed by Pranab Mukherjee, who resigned in June as finance minister to contest the Presidential polls, and the panel is yet to be reconstituted. No new head of the EGoM has been announced. RIL had on June 15 written to the oil ministry proposing to price natural gas it produces from the Krishna-Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal at a rate equivalent to price India pays for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG). The government had in 2007 fixed a price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu for gas from KG-D6 block for first five years of production. KG-D6 fields began production on April 1, 2009 and the current price expires on March 31, 2014. From April, 2014, RIL wants the gas to be price at import parity just as domestically produced crude oil is priced. Sources said the firm has submitted the pricing formula or basis a good 21 months before the new rates come into effect, so that the government has ample time to approve it. RIL wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67% of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. This formula is different from the one that was approved in 2007.  _PAGEBREAK_ According to this formula, KG-D6 gas price was capped at crude oil price of USD 60 per barrel, translating into asale price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu. KG-D6 gas at USD 60 a barrel oil price, according to the new formula, would be priced at USD 7.862 per mmBtu. Sources said the formula proposed a true arms'length market price as it is the same that the government has approved for import of LNG. The formula proposed by RIL is the same at which Petronet LNG Ltd, the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer,buys 7.5 million tonne per annum of LNG from RasGas of Qatar. RasGas charges 12.67% of JCC and Petronet pays a further USD 0.26 per mmBtu for shipping the gas in its liquid form (LNG) from Qatar. KG-D6 output has almost halved to about 31.5 million standard cubic meters per day in the last two years due to unexpected drop in reservoir pressure and increased water and sand ingress in wells.  RIL believes fields outside currently producing ones can contribute 30-35 mmscmd to the output. "

However, the fund raising plan is amusing, said an&amp;amp;nbsp; nalyst, who wished not to be named, as the company is sitting on a cash pile of over Rs 76,000 crore as of FY12. At the AGM last month, Ambani had unveiled a plan to&amp;amp;nbsp; ouble operating profits by investing Rs 1 lakh crore over the next five years across energy, retail and telecom to double operating profit.

Indian shares fell for a second day in a row on Monday as HDFC fell ahead of its earnings results this week, with sentiment also hit after US jobs data and falling inflation in China reinforced concerns about the global economy. Corporate earnings results, and more importantly, the guidance given could be key in determining whether India's main stock indices can sustain their double digit gains this year. The rallies have come despite challenging fiscal and economic outlooks that have dented the rupee currency. A shortfall of nearly 50% of the average rainfalls in the seasonal monsoon period so far has become the latest domestic worry, given worries about the impact on rural consumers. BofA-ML says SBI, ICICI Bank , HDFC Bank , Infosys and Tata Motors are expected to be the key contributors of growth. Infosys, the country's second-biggest software services exporter, fell 0.3% ahead of its results on Thursday, though larger rival Tata Consultancy Services, which reports on the same day, added 0.9%. However, Reliance Industries, Tata Steel, Hindalco Industries to drag down growth, BoA-ML forecasts.

Earlier the price was increased by Rs 1.75 per kg on January 1 and by Rs 1.90 per kg later on March 6. IGL, which hiked price of CNG sold to automobiles in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad by Rs 3.30 per kg to Rs 43.10 per kg, said the increase was necessitated because of fall in value of rupee and rise in cost of imported gas. The hike had been necessitated because IGL is buying more of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) after supplies from Reliance Industries' KG-D6 gas fields dried up. Imported fuel costs at least three times more than USD 4.20 per million British thermal unit rate fixed for domestic gas. City gas distributors like IGL are not getting any supplies from KG-D6 since September last year, after a 40% output drop forced the government to cut supplies to non-priority sectors so that requirement of power and fertiliser plants can be fully met. &amp;quot;IGL is constrained to announce increase in the price of CNG since the input cost of entire pool of natural gas has risen substantially since the last price revision due to appreciation of dollar vis-&agrave;-vis rupee up to 14% and the increased dependence on imported LNG,&amp;quot; the company said. In addition, there has been an increase in cost due to a massive hike of over 23% in electricity tariff and also in minimum wages announced by the government.  IGL said this increase would have minor impact on the per km running cost of vehicles in Delhi. &amp;quot;For autos, the increase would be 8 paisa per km, for taxi it would be 14 paisa per km and in case of buses, the increase would be 83 paisa per km, which translates to less than two paisa per passenger km,&amp;quot; the statement added."

India is a tough market for retailers, with same-store sales growth slowing to single digits at many chains. Two years ago, a sales growth of 25% for many fashion retailers open a year or more was not uncommon. Reliance Brands declined to provide such data. &amp;quot;We are different than companies who are driven by valuations and the next round of funding,&amp;quot; said Darshan Mehta, chief executive of Reliance Brands, which sells branded goods in India through joint ventures with foreign companies. Strict local sourcing rules for wholly-owned retail outlets mean nearly all foreign-branded stores operate in India through joint ventures with local partners like Reliance, or franchises. Reliance Brands opened its first store in April 2010 and through March operated about 60 stores under 12 brands including Diesel, Brooks Brothers, Thomas Pink, and Kenneth Cole. It aims to open 40 stores in the year ending in March and plans to sign up more foreign brands, said Mehta, a former stockbroker. While overall profitability is &amp;quot;few years away,&amp;quot; the company's near-term focus is on profitable stores, he said. &amp;quot;We have a powerful parent and a very patient parent and when you have that you can go ahead and build a robust business...irrespective of the challenges,&amp;quot; he said from his office in south Mumbai overlooking the Arabian Sea. Ambani has said he hopes to grow the retail business, which includes 1,300 stores, mostly supermarkets, over the next three to four years. While Ambani is patient, his investors have been less so, with some grumbling at a recent shareholders meeting over the push into retail and telecoms, businesses aimed at cashing in on Indian consumer growth, but where profits are years away. Shares in Reliance are down 27% since the start of 2011, in part on falling output at its main gas field. GROWING ALONE Ambani's retail conviction is not shared by all his rivals. DLF Brands, part of the country's largest real estate developer, debt-laden DLF , recently ended its joint venture with Italy's Giorgio Armani, which was unhappy with the lack of scale offered by its partner, according to industry analysts. Armani recently struck a franchise agreement with Genesis Luxury, a rival to Reliance Brands. India's largest retailer, Future Group, which runs supermarkets and clothing outlets, has scaled back its expansion from 2.5 million to 2 million sqft this fiscal year due to an economy growing at its weakest in nine years. The growth rate was 5.3% on an annual basis in the March quarter. Reliance benefits from rules that once banned full ownership by foreign single-brand retailers. The ban was lifted in January, but a rule that foreign brands must source 30% of their goods from local, small and mid-sized vendors has deterred most foreigners from setting up on their own. Only two overseas retailers - Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Britain's Pavers shoe company - have applied for licences since the rule was changed. Mehta, dressed in a white Thomas Pink shirt and pair of Diesel jeans, said the change in the law does not make India an easy place for newcomers. &amp;quot;Retailers who are not affected by the law also look for partners in India. The law doesn't take away the complexity of the market,&amp;quot; Mehta said. Another hurdle is a 15% fall in the value of the rupee since its yearly high in February, which drives up import prices. &amp;quot;The bigger worry is if, going forward, the economy (worsens). That will have a much larger impact than a Rs 500-price hike,&amp;quot; Mehta said."

Acute shortage of coal for power projects as well as worsening health of distribution companies (discoms) remain major worries for the sector. &amp;quot;The government's and companies' continued inability to address the challenges in the power sector may result in significant NPLs (Non Performing Loans) in banking sector over the next 2-3 years,&amp;quot; brokerage firm Kotak Securities has said. In a recent report, the entity noted that new power projects having a total capacity of 40-50 GW could be in danger of defaulting on their debt obligations. &amp;quot;We estimate the banking system's exposure (including loans from PFC and REC) to the power sector will rise to Rs 9 trillion (Rs 9 lakh crore) by the end of FY 2015 from Rs 5.3 trillion (Rs 5.3 lakh crore) at the end of FY 2012 (19% CAGR in FY 2012-15E),&amp;quot; the report noted. PFC and REC are leading state-run lenders to the power sector. Pointing out that the central government's effort to address coal-supply and pricing challenges &amp;quot;is quite timid,&amp;quot; it said that a sharp rise is expected in NPLs in power generation sector as well as increase in SEB (State Electricity Board) losses over the next 2-3 years. &amp;quot;We see several new power generation projects as being unable to meet their debt obligations. Banks may not recognise them as NPLs under various guises but the magnitude of the problem is too large for any quick-fix solution,&amp;quot; it said. Even though, the government is taking initiatives to ease fuel supply scenario for the power sector, many existing and upcoming projects are faced with severe coal shortage. Amid rising concerns about defaults in the banking system, the government is working on plans to restructure the debtburden of state discoms. The precarious health of discoms has been mainly blamed on lower tariff realisation and efficiency issues."

Mukesh Ambani-led RIL that began a buyback programme of Rs 10,440 crore early this year, has so far purchased shares to the tune of Rs 1,929 crore through open market transaction. &amp;quot;We have, to date, bought back 2.7 crore shares at a cost of Rs 1,929 crore - this represents 22.5 per cent of the cap set by the Board in terms of number of shares,&amp;quot; RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said while addressing to the company's shareholders. &amp;quot;The buyback represents highly accretive use of cash by the company. It will supplement earnings growth from operations, for higher EPS, (earning per share)in the near future. &amp;quot;We are also reinvesting our cash flows at accelerated pace in new projects and new businesses. These will bear fruition and growth in earnings over the next few years,&amp;quot; he added. Although, the buyback started in February, it gained momentum last month, when it has bought maximum shares. Market experts are of opinion that the oil and gas giant is buying back shares aggressively from the open market with an aim to shore up stock valuations. However, the buyback programme appears to have provided little respite to the stock price, which has fallen around over 15% since the share repurchase offer announced, under performing the benchmark Sensex that has declined more than 6% during the period. Although, RIL had gained over six per cent since it touched 52-week low of Rs 671 on May 8. The stock had received a setback after credit rating agency Moody's downgraded RIL as credit negative following the downward revision in the company's assessment of natural gas reserve. RIL shares were trading at Rs 723.05 today, which is much below the maximum price of Rs 870 per share fixed for buyback. &amp;quot;Reliance has underperformed the markets during last few years. It is not able to perform on the back of the falling output from KG&ndash;D6. The progress of work seems to be very slow. &amp;quot;Another problem with the Reliance is that it is not able to use cash reserves in a very effective manner,&amp;quot; Wellindia Vice-President Research Vivek Negi said. &amp;quot;Fundamentally, the company is still doing average. But there is no clarity on the future prospects of the company,&amp;quot; he added. RIL's Rs 10,440-crore buyback offer could be the biggest ever in the history of Indian capital market. The buyback programme, which commenced on February 7, is scheduled to continue till January 19, 2013."

Controversial technocrat V K Sibal was the head of Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) which gave RIL approvals for raising the cost on the plea that gas reserves as well as cost of services have gone up.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Operators like RIL are allowed to recover all their cost before sharing profits with the government. Higher capital cost directly impacts the government's revenue. The agency had registered a preliminary enquiry into the case in November 2009 on request of the Oil Ministry following several objections raised by CVC on the KG-D6 deal. CBI sources said that probe has been completed in connection with the case and the matter has been referred to the Attorney General seeking legal opinion in the matter. During its probe, the agency had taken the ministry's assistance to understand the arguments offered by Reliance when it raised the cost of developing Dhirubhai 1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block from USD 2.39 billion proposed in 2004 to USD 5.196 billion in Phase-1 and another USD 3.3 billion in Phase-II.  With exploration and production of oil and gas from deep sea being complex issues, the agency had used the expertise of a domain expert to understand if the expenses proposed by Reliance and approved by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) were justified. Besides, CBI also probed why DGH allowed Reliance to retain the entire KG-D6 block in alleged contravention of the policy that stipulates relinquishing 25 per cent of the area every year. The Central Vigilance Commission had forwarded a complaint in which it was alleged that there was a phenomenal increase in capital expenditure in the project. Reliance had said in a statement, &amp;quot;As aesponsible operator, it has fully complied with the requirements in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) at all times in conducting petroleum operations, and refutes any suggestion to thecontrary. The KG-D6 project has been globally acclaimed for its cost effective, speedy, flawless execution and smooth commissioning.&amp;quot; "

Relogistics Infrastructure Ltd (Relog), a subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani's RGTIL, had in 2007-08 won government authorisation to lay Kakinada-Basudebpur-Howrah pipeline, Kakinada-Chennai line, Chennai-Bangalore-Mangalore pipeline and Chennai-Tuticorin line but physical work on these pipelines haven't yet started. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB)has written to the Oil Ministry recommending cancellation of the authorisation over delays in implementation of the pipelines, a top PNGRB official said. &amp;quot;The Board has taken a view of recommending cancellation of authorisation for the four pipelines. That has been communicated to the government,&amp;quot; he said, adding the licences were given by the government prior to PNGRB began functional and so its cancellation can now be done only by the Ministry. Relog has cited uncertaintly about availability of gas for not building the lines that as per the original authorisation were to be build in three years from date of all approvals. The three year period expires this month. The official said Relog has also refused to furnish bank gurantee, which can be confiscated if the company did not complete the pipeline within the given timeframe. RGTIL says it built the 1,396-km East-West pipeline from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Bharuch in Gujarat to ferry natural gas from eastern offshore KG-D6 fields, in record time. And it is &amp;quot;fully equipped&amp;quot; to complete the four pipelines in 24 months, but wants to synchronise the construction with gas sourcing. The company claims that while demand can be perhaps generated, sourcing of gas is a problem.Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 field output has dropped to 32 million standard cubic meters per day instead of rising to 80 mmscmd.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; KG-D6 and other eastern offshore gas fields were supposed to be the source of fuel for the pipelines but in view of falling output and no other field coming on stream in near future, the pipeline work has been delayed, it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; As per the original authorisation, the pipelines were to be completed within 36 months of the notification of expression of interest or 24 months from the date of 100% availability of right of user (RoU), whichever is later. The twin deadlines expire between June to August for the four pipelines. The official said PNGRB has not yet taken any view on the authorisations granted by state-owned GAIL India Ltd. "

Reliance generates up to USD 1 billion in free cash every quarter and held USD 13.8 billion at end-March, far more than it can put to work under existing investment plans or through an ongoing share buyback programme. &amp;quot;Earlier, investors gave them the benefit of doubt that cash was being deployed in high-margin businesses, but people are questioning that now,&amp;quot; said Michiel van Voorst, a portfolio manager for Asia-Pacific Equities at Robeco Hong Kong. Those questions are likely to get an airing at the company's annual shareholder's meeting on Thursday. Reliance has cooled in its hunt for acquisitions in North American shale gas as US natural gas prices have plunged. At home, investment in its gas blocks has stalled as output slows and it battles the government over gas pricing. The company has so far acquired less than a quarter of the USD 2.1 billion of shares it plans to buy back from investors, even as it raises debt to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Reliance makes much of its plans to spend USD 12 billion over the next few years to boost capacity at its petrochemicals plant and refinery complex, the world's largest, in western India. However, such projects are typically funded about 70% from debt, which leaves plenty of low-yielding cash left over. Last year, Ambani outlined a big drive into consumer-focused businesses, looking to take advantage of rising spending power in Asia's third-largest economy. The problem for investors is that the retail business is loss-making even after six years and Reliance is spending billions to get into a fiercely competitive and unpredictable telecoms sector, with returns a distant and uncertain prospect. &amp;quot;I think most investors feel Reliance should concentrate and not go everywhere, not diversify in every direction,&amp;quot; said Taina Erajuuri, portfolio manager at FIM India in Helsinki. &amp;quot;They've been burning cash on some investments, which I'm not happy (about),&amp;quot; added Erajuuri, who has sold her Reliance shares in the past year. FALLING RETURNS Reliance is widely credited with having one of the savviest treasury operations in corporate India. As returns have dwindled from core businesses, the proportion of profits from its treasury has surged, accounting for as much as 42% in the March quarter, roughly triple the share until a year ago. Return on capital slipped to 11.4% in January-March from 13.8% two years ago. While the slowdown in its energy businesses contributed to that decline, treasury gains also weigh on returns. Its cash pile is about three times what it was two years ago, following the USD 7.2 billion sale last year of 30% in some of its oil and gas blocks to BP Plc. The bulk of Reliance's cash, held in bank deposits, corporate debt and government securities, has an estimated return of 9-11%. The interest cost on its long-term borrowings is 6-8%, giving it treasury gains of around 3 percentage points. The cash hoard has not deterred Reliance from raising more debt. Last month, it raised USD 2 billion in a 13-year loan, taking its debt raisings in the last four months to nearly USD 4 billion and increasing its gross debt to USD 15.4 billion. It is seeking another USD 1 billion loan for capital spending, sources told Thomson Reuters publication Basis Point. &amp;quot;They're generating more profit from cash than from exploration, and almost equal to gains from refining,&amp;quot; said SP Tulsian, an independent market strategist in Mumbai. &amp;quot;Even if these returns are good, is it a comfortable situation?&amp;quot; END OF GROWTH CYCLE? At this week's AGM, Ambani could face questions on the gradually weakening performance in the company's core energy businesses, and on the lack of profits from its push into consumer-focused businesses. Its retail business continues to lose money and, despite 1,300 stores, the company is nowhere close to the scale it aimed for at the time of its launch. Reliance is also spending heavily on telecoms and in January invested in TV18 media group. Investors complain Reliance is looking to bet its future, and its cash, on newer businesses that have long gestation periods, and may see returns flow only after 4-5 years. They are voting with their feet. Reliance shares fell by a third last year. The stock trades near a three-year low and its market value has sunk to below USD 41 billion, dumping Ambani from the top of Asia's rich-list. Tata Consultancy Services, part of arch-rival Tata Group, has unseated it as India's most valuable listed company. Sluggish global growth and a tough regulatory and investment climate at home mean many Indian firms such as Coal India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Infosys have shunned deals and now sit on mounting cash. Reliance's cash-pile is not far short of much larger global energy majors such as Shell with USD 15 billion, Chevron with USD 18.8 billion and Exxon Mobil with USD 21.8 billion. Apple Inc has a record USD 110 billion in cash. &amp;quot;Globally, you're seeing many oil and gas companies giving very high dividends. But that also means admitting they have come to the end of a high growth cycle,&amp;quot; said Robeco's van Voorst. &amp;quot;I don't know if Reliance is willing to admit that.&amp;quot;"

With output from KG-D6 continuing to decline, RIL was against signing new Gas Sale and Purchase Agreements (GSPA) as meeting new supply commitments would have meant cutting gas supplies to existing power plants. But under intense pressure from Delhi government and oil ministry, RIL has now agreed to sign GSPAs for supply of 2.16 million standard cubic meters per day to Delhi's Bawana power project and NTPC, industry sources said. RIL has informed the Delhi government and Pragati Power Corp of its intention to sign GSPA for supply of 0.93 mmsmcd of gas and has forwarded a draft agreement. KG-D6 fields had seen drop from 61.5 mmscmd in March, 2010, to about 32 mmscmd, forcing pro-rata cuts on customers. Sources said the new pacts would mean supplies to 25 power plants who were allocated gas from Krishna Godavari basin fields, further going down. Private power producer Lanco has already warned of power plants, which are currently operating at less than 38%, shutting down if supplies are cut any further. Supplying gas to Bawana and NTPC would mean supplies would further reduce to uneconomical levels of 20-25%. While the KG-D6 gas supplies dropped, the pro-rata cut was applied only to the 25 power plants which had an original allocation of 28.90 mmcmd. Fertiliser plants, which were allocated about 15 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas, did not face such a cut. Supplies to Pragati Power would mean a further drop in supplies to power plants, sources added."

Company sources said the fall in output from eastern offshore KG-D6 field to 32-33 million standard cubic meters per day from 61.5 mmsmd two years ago was due to geological complexities and reservoir not behaving as predicted. The output has fallen because of water and sand ingress in wells and reservoir outside the main channel not participating in the production, they said, adding such erratic and unpredictable behaviour of something which is 2-km below the seabed forced the company to halt drilling of well and do more studies before putting more investment. All drilling cost is recoverable and if the company had gone for indiscriminate drilling, the government's profit take would have been impacted, they said. &amp;quot;We are not suppressing production. If anything, it is the government which is suppressing price,&amp;quot; one of them said. He said the letter the company got from the government approving USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit as the price of KG-D6 gas, clearly stated that if RIL was to get a higher price than the approved rate, the higher would be used for calculation of profit petroleum etc. This essentially meant that the government was open to RIL selling gas at higher rates, he said adding the company is seeking market price for its gas. RIL blamed the oil ministry for artificially suppressing gas prices paid to domestic producers saying the ministry was happy paying USD 16-18 per million British thermal unit for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) but does not want domestic companies to be paid remunerative prices. &amp;quot;Need of the hour is to restore contractual sanctity,&amp;quot; a source said citing from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) which guarantees market price and marketing freedom. Sources said the company was eager to resolve the dispute over cost recovery through arbitration and has requested the government to quickly appoint arbitrators. There was no provisions in the PSC to link cost-recovery to production, they said in reference to the notice oil ministry served on RIL disallowing USD 1.005 billion expenditure for failing to drill 9 out of the committed 31 wells. The PSC, they said, allowed operators to recover all their cost from oil and gas production and the ministry move was illegal. The dispute can be settled through arbitration, they added."

Remember these are midcap ideas not just for the day, but stocks that look attractive in the medium-term as well.  This week, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com, Ashish Kapur or Investshoppe and Saurabh Mittal of Swadeshi Credits battle it out for top honours SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com Buy Mahindra Satyam with a target of Rs 71 and keep a stoploss at Rs 65. The company has posted very good numbers for Q4 where an EBITDA margin has increased by 136 bps on a sequential basis with Q4 EBITDA margins placed at 17.54%. The Q4 PAT of Rs 525 crore will be seen quite positive by the market though it includes an exceptional gain of Rs 109 crore and tax ride back of Rs 94 crore but still overall EPS of Rs 11 plus for FY12 will be seen quite positive by the market. Buy Tech Mahindra with a target of Rs 640 and keep a stoploss at Rs 598. The better result posted by Mahindra Satyam will be having a reflection on the share of this company also because Mahindra Satyam is merging with Tech Mahindra on a swap ratio of two shares of Tech Mahindra for every 17 shares held in Mahindra Satyam. Even the working to be declared by Tech Mahindra on 23rd May for Q4 is likely to be good.  Buy HDFC Warrants with a target of Rs 54 and keep a stoploss at Rs 44. One warrant entitles the warrant holders to subscribe to one share of HDFC at Rs 600 by August 2012. The stock HDFC has been witnessing renewed buying interest after the MSCI goof up and the positive view on the stock is likely to continue. Hence this seems a very good arbitrage play of buying HDFC Warrant instead of HDFC shares. Buy Shalimar Paints with a target of Rs 524 and keep a stoploss at Rs 473. The stock has yesterday seen the informed buying and in fact for last one week the share has been seeing the delivery based informed buying largely because of the better Q4 numbers having posted by the company with EPS of close to about Rs 16 and EPS of close to about Rs 39 for FY12. But it is learnt that the stake sell by the promoters are likely to happen in the near future and hence the share is seen under accumulation by the informed circle. Disclaimer: He has a holding in HDFC Warrants. Stocks discussed may have been recommended to clients. _PAGEBREAK_  Ashish Kapur or Investshoppe Buy DB Realty with a target of Rs 79 and keep a stoploss at Rs 71.50. This company has got beaten down very badly over the last one year due to various controversies surrounding it including the telecom scam. But all that seems to be passed with release of Mr. Balwa. I think the fact is that this company is available now at a very cheap valuation. It has a lot of prime residential space especially in south and Central Mumbai which augers very well because that is a premium part of Mumbai. So we feel that all the negatives are already factored in.  Buy Max India with a target of Rs 208 and keep a stoploss at Rs 189. The company is slowly and steadily getting out of its unrelated businesses like polypropylene film, specialty films division and that&rsquo;s going to result in a significant cash flow for the company. Second is that New York life recently exited the company and sold its stake to Mitsui Sumitomo. The value of the business of Max India is nearly the same as market value of the total company.  Short JSW Steel with a target of Rs 568 and keep a stoploss at Rs 622. We remain bearish on JSW Steel because this is one company which has a very high leverage on its balance sheet, is not fully integrated. So we will get impacted by the rising or any change in the cost of raw materials. Also the company is yet to recover fully from the impact of the mining ban in Karnataka. Though there has been a resolution to it but by the time the issue is completely resolved it may take some more time.  Short Patel Engineering with a target of Rs 80 and keep a stoploss at Rs 88.50. Patel Engineering is one infrastructure company where the future looks very bleak at least for the near term. The company is carrying a huge amount of debt. Has a stretched working capital cycle and also many of their projects are facing rough weather and they have been in news recently for wrong reasons. So there is ample reason to believe that any weakness in the market would result in further slippage in prices of Patel Engineering. Very safe stock to go short on if you want to hedge your portfolio.  Disclaimer: He holds Max India and JSW Steel. _PAGEBREAK_  Saurabh Mittal of Swadeshi Credits Buy Unitech with a target of Rs 23 and keep a stoploss at Rs 20.50. Unitech showed some strength couple of trading sessions back and it has taken a big beating in the last couple of months and I think it&rsquo;s ready for a technical bounce once the market behaves or if there is a technical bounce in the market I think Unitech will show decent appreciation.  Buy Tata Global with a target of Rs 112 and keep a stoploss at Rs 105. Tata Global is also one of those stocks that trades between a range of about an Rs 100-120 and has fallen and it showed some strength couple of trading sessions back. So I expect this to go up with the market for another three or four percentage points in today&rsquo;s trade. Buy Reliance Industries with a target of Rs 700 and keep a stoploss at Rs 678. Reliance Industries also has not performed well for the last few months and I think all the bad news is out for the stock. It has started showing some strength in the last couple of trading sessions and the markets were down, this stock held up and I expect it to show some further strength for today&rsquo;s trade. Short BPCL with a target of Rs 728 and keep a stoploss at Rs 745. BPCL and the oil marketing companies have shown decent strength with the fall in crude prices overseas. I think that has played out for a while and you might see some sort of profit booking and a little bit of downside for these stocks. So for today&rsquo;s trade I am shorting BPCL.

Sources further say that the oil ministry is yet to formally discuss the price hike. Also, the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) will take up the law ministry's opinion when it meets next. In the existing formula for the KG-D6 gas price, crude price has been capped at &amp;amp;#36;60 even if you take &amp;amp;#36;120 as the price of crude. The gas price as per this approved formula comes to only &amp;amp;#36;4.48/mmbtu. With the law ministry opining that the KG-D6 gas price can be revised, we should perhaps expect RIL submitting a new formula in the past. In the past it has asked the government to increase the gas price to &amp;amp;#36;6.  RIL has been arguing its gas is the cheapest in the country and at par with APM gas. Other refiners like Essar Oil get over &amp;amp;#36;4 for their gas. If you go by the approved KG-D6 price formula, the gas price comes to only &amp;amp;#36;4.48.  It may be noted that RIL and its partner BP were seeking a higher gas prices and the oil ministry was against hiking price and had said hiking price would increase subsidy burden. It may&amp;amp;nbsp; also be recalled that in January this year, RIL had given the government 90 days to arrive at a decision over the pricing of gas and had stated that the current price of gas was no longer viable. In February, the government had rejected RIL's demand for a revision in the KG-D6 gas price, saying the USD 4.2 per mmBtu rate for five years was not only agreed to by company but also upheld by the Supreme Court (SC). The Ministry on January&amp;amp;nbsp; wrote to RIL quoting from the May 7, 2010, Supreme Court judgement in the gas row between the company and Anil Ambani's Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) to assert that &amp;quot;any price revision proposal will be examined by the government after expiry of five years from commencement of supply.&amp;quot; By this logic RIL can revise price only after 2012 as it started gas production from the block in April 2009  &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Reliance said in a statement late on Friday that the oil ministry has proposed to &amp;quot;disallow certain costs&amp;quot;, without quantifying how much the company was planning to recover. These &amp;quot;issues will be resolved through arbitration process&amp;quot; initiated by the company in November, it said. The ministry has so far refused to join the arbitration. Reliance &amp;quot;continues to maintain that a contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the production sharing contract and there are no provisions that entitle the government to disallow recovery of any contract cost,&amp;quot; the company said. The petroleum ministry has allowed Reliance to recover costs only for building infrastructure used for gas production and not for the wells that have not been drilled and have not added to output, the oil ministry source told reporters. Reliance is currently producing about 27 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) from its key natural gas field in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin, the source said, far lower than the 80 mmscmd gas it had planned to produce from April this year. Under India's exploration policy, the government allows companies to first recover their cost from oil and gas revenue, and subsequently share profits with the government. Reliance's growth outlook has been marred by falling gas output from its huge gas fields, with production less than half of what was originally estimated. The Comptroller and Auditor General last year criticised both Reliance and the government over development of the KG gas field, and the company's shares slumped by a third in 2011. The company has earlier said unexpected geology has caused the decline in output and drilling more wells would not help, but this has been rejected by the oil ministry."

Gas output from KG-D6 in the week ended April 1 dropped to 33.89 mmscmd from 34.09 mmscmd in the previous week, according to a status report filed by the company with the Oil Ministry. KG-D6, where water and sand ingress coupled with drop in pressure has led a drastic fall in per-well output, had produced 34.62 mmscmd in the begging of March. Production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3, the largest among the 19 oil and gas finds RIL has made in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, slipped to 27.52 mmscmd during March 26 and April 1.

Together with 6.37 mmscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 produced 33.89 mmsmcd during the week ending April 1. The KG-D6 output has fallen since hitting peak of 61.5 mmscmd in March 2010 as RIL shut wells after wells on water and sand ingress. During the week under review, &amp;quot;total 12 wells were on production and 6 wells (A2, A6, A10, B1, B2 &amp;amp;amp; B13) were kept closed due to high water cut/sanding issues,&amp;quot; the report said. The output from KG-D6 is short of the 70.39 mmscmd-level (61.88 mmscmd from D1 and D3 and 8.5 mmscmd from the MA field) envisaged by now as per the field development plan approved in 2006. While Reliance holds 60% interest in KG-D6, UK's BP Plc holds 30% and Niko Resources of Canada the remaining 10%. The report said one out of the six well on MA field had to be shut due to water loading. The field produced an average of 11,071 barrels per day of oil in the week and 1,627 barrels per day of condensate. Of the 33.89 mmscmd of production, 12.71 mmscmd was sold to fertiliser plants at government approved rate of USD 4.20 per million British thermal unit. Another 18.10 mmscmd was sold to power plants and the remaining 3.08 mmscmd was consumed sectors such as LPG. RIL projected an output of 33.7 mmscmd during the month."

Essar has just completed a USD 1.6 billion overhaul and expansion at the Vadinar refinery, raising capacity to around 360,000 barrels per day from 280,000 bpd and adding units that can process cheaper, heavier crude into fuels. The refinery would reach 400,000 bpd capacity in September, Managing Director Lalit Kumar Gupta said. &amp;quot;The difference in our margins and those in our neighbouring refinery, which is as complex as we are today, has been about USD 3 to USD 4/bbl. We should be able to bridge that gap now,&amp;quot; Gupta told Reuters in an interview. The refinery would gain another USD 1 a barrel in margins through using a coal-fired power plant to provide electricity, which would save on fuel costs, Gupta said. Essar had earlier forecast a 35% jump in revenues for the fiscal year that started on April 1. Revenues for the previous fiscal year were around &amp;amp;#36;9.5 billion. Essar plans to sell a stake of around 15% by June 2013, as required by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to reduce the stake held by founding shareholders to 75% from nearly 90% now. The company believes its shares are trading below value and the price will improve after investors see it operate the newly expanded refinery for two quarters, Gupta said. That would be a better time for any stake sale, he added. Given the full expansion will be completed in September, that would push any possible stake-sell to close to the deadline. &amp;quot;We will come to market when we are rightly priced. At the current price we think we are heavily undervalued. We see significant upside in our refinery business,&amp;quot; Gupta said. Essar Oil's market valuation stands at USD 1.3 billion and its shares have barely changed so far in 2012, closing on Thursday at Rs 50 a share, a fraction of the peak in 2008 of nearly Rs 356. Essar, 87% owned by London-listed Essar Energy , is one of only two private refiners in India. The other is Reliance Industries, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar and has among the best margins in the industry. Reliance reported gross refining margins of USD 7.60 a barrel for the March quarter, down from USD 9.20 a year ago. Margins Gupta said he expected refinery margins to rise in coming quarters as the northern hemisphere summer driving season demand kicked in and improved profits for making gasoline. &amp;quot;Going forward, once the gasoline cracks are better, margins can only go up,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Definitely complex refineries have to make more margins.&amp;quot; The company is currently negotiating with the government in Gujarat more time to repay a USD 1.24 billion sales tax due after the Supreme Court dismissed Essar's petition seeking a review of an earlier verdict to defer payment. Essar, which has already booked a Rs 4000&amp;amp;nbsp;crore loss in its books for the tax liability, hopes to service repayments from the increased cashflows of its expanded refinery, but is also in talks with several banks to raise funds for the payment, Gupta said, but declined to name the banks. &amp;quot;If the Gujarat government insists on some interest, to that extent our earnings will definitely get impacted. But going forward, we see strong cash flows and earnings, so we are not unduly worried,&amp;quot; Gupta said. Essar will be able to use heavy crude for almost 80% of its capacity and is gradually shifting to Latin American oil from Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. &amp;quot;Middle East crude slowly will get reduced in our basket. If they are not low API, if they are costlier, we will reduce. Ultimately, it's a question of optimising margins,&amp;quot; Gupta said. Essar is also reducing dependence on oil from Iran, its single largest supplier, in line with plans by other Indian refiners as international sanctions target the flow of Iran's exports. The US and its allies aim to reduce Iran's oil revenues to pressure Tehran not to build nuclear weapons. Essar had renewed a contract with Iran in January for 100,000 bpd, Gupta said, the same volume as last year. Iranian crude would account for around 25% of Essar's supplies when the expansion was completed, down from around 40 percent, he added. Industry sources have told Reuters Essar plans to cut 15% from its 100,0000 bpd contract, which runs from April 2012 for a year. Gupta declined to comment. Earlier this month, data published by a leading industry consultant showed India has vaulted to the top of the list of Iran's oil customers, overtaking China, in a first-quarter buying surge ahead of tighter sanctions against Tehran this summer. India's Iranian crude imports could fall around 25% from April, when new annual contracts take effect."

Ambuja Cements: Plans to increase its capacity with brownfield expansion at Sankrail grinding unit in the eastern region adding 0.8mtpa capacity and a Greenfield expansion project to set up 2.2mtpa clinkerization unit in Nagaur district (agreement signed with Rajastan Industrial Development and Industrial Corporation in 2010). The Rajasthan plant is expected to come on stream by 2015. The company also plans to start production of coal for the coal block allotted in the state of Maharashtra (in a JV with IST and Lafarge) by 2015. The total capex for these projects is estimated to be at Rs27bn. The funding for the project would be through internal accruals as Ambuja&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents for CY11 itself stood at Rs 29bn. Though Ambuja&rsquo;s 1QCY12 performance was boosted by lower costs helping expansion in margins, we expect margins to come under pressure in the ensuing quarters as the recent cost increases like railway freight hike (+23% effective from March 6, 2012) &amp;amp;amp; excise duty hike (+200 bps increased on March 16, 2012)) are yet to reflect completely. CIL&rsquo;s coal price hikes post its wage hike would also add further pressure on energy costs. Revenues at Rs26.3bn grew 19.3% yoy as cement volumes grew 9.6% yoy while realizations at Rs4262/t grew 8.9% yoy and 4.3% qoq. We believe that the stock&rsquo;s valuations at 8.3X EV/E &amp;amp;amp; EV/T of USD163 does not factor in these margin risks and leaves little upside from current levels. Maintain Reduce. Hindustan Zinc: During FY12 annual production capacity of lead was enhanced to 193kt (from 93ktpa, silver capacity enhanced to 500tpa (from 250ktpa), while a zinc smelter of 60ktpa (from total capacity of 879ktpa) brought under ramp down. The mining plan of their mine (largest mine namely Agucha) warrant development activities during H1FY12 at the site which could adversely affect production before it restarts at full rate during H2FY12. The lead business would ramp up steadily during FY13. We expect silver business to grow slowly clocking 300 ton in FY13 and 350 ton in FY14 (Co has however guided 350ton in FY13).  Focus currently lies on systematic greenfield exploration opportunities over 4500 sq km of area on which they have Reconnaisance Permits (RPs). It has also sought new RPs for around 18700 sq km. It is quite evident that additional refined metal capacities will be taken up only after they have access to fresh mining sources. With the strong balance sheet and cash of Rs180bn as on 31st March 2012 possibility of growth through acquisition cannot be ruled out. They have also announced dividend policy envisaging about 20% PAT as dividend payout. At the CMP of Rs 126, the stock is trading at 8.2x its FY14E EPS and 3.8x FY14E EV/ EBITDA. We value the stock at 5x FY14 EV/ EBITDA. Maintain Buy with a revised target price of Rs 147/ share. Reliance Industries (RIL): Reported its numbers above our expectations and in line with market expectations. GRMs surprised on upside with higher margins QoQ despite benchmark Singapore GRMs being lower QoQ and light-heavy crude spread worsening. Company reported GRM of &amp;amp;#36;7.6/bbl v/s &amp;amp;#36;6.8 in Q3FY12 and &amp;amp;#36;9.2/bbl Q4FY11. Higher Other Income at Rs23bn v/s Rs9bn in Q4FY11 stalled the decline of net profit to Rs42bn, a decline of 21%yoy and 5%qoq. Going ahead we remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of weak demand and/or new capacities additions. While the concerns on declining gas production in KG basin have remained, RIL stock has under performed by 12% / 20% in the last 3months/12months. Also a weak refining and petchem margin scenario has not helped the stock. Going ahead we see refining segment on a weak footing on the back of weak demand. Refining margins may gain some support from refining mothballing in US and Europe, however we suspect the sustainability of such support. As of now about 2mbpd of refining capacity in US and Europe is either shut down and looking for buyer or operating at lower capacity. (Refer our Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas update dated 18th April 2012). In case of petchem, demand remains a concern and any weakness in demand could impact any sustained recovery in margins. With the likelihood of gas production declining further, the stock is likely to remain weak and underperform going ahead. Going ahead we remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of new capacities and/or weakening demand. We now factor in lower GRMs and built in flat margins from petchem for FY13E and FY14E. The stock currently trades at FY13E and FY14E PE multiple of 11.7x and 11.2x, we maintain our reco to Hold and cut our target price to Rs835 (Rs.879 earlier), says Emkay Global Financial Services research report.

GRM is the difference between the cost of crude and the price of refined products. This is what experts believe must have led to better GRMs for RIL SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com says: Market has not expected GRM to cross &amp;amp;#36; 7bbl as crude cost went up. Between January and March, the price of brent crude rose 15.6% to &amp;amp;#36;122.88 each barrel. Dealing a double blow, the rupee strengthened against the dollar by around 5%, which made crude more expensive. However,&amp;amp;nbsp; he points out that despite better-than-expected GRM, the net profit was short of the expectation, that indicates that probably the petchem has taken more hit than what it was expected. &amp;amp;nbsp;Energy expert Narendra Taneja believes: The sources of crude and also finding better markets where they were able to actually get better price for petroleum products such as the United States and also certain markets in the Middle East. Brokerages had estimated RIL&rsquo;s GRM to come in at &amp;amp;#36;6.5 per barrel, below the benchmark GRM of &amp;amp;#36;7.6 per barrel. &ldquo;RIL&rsquo;s GRM could be 30% lower than the year ago, BoA-ML report had said. &amp;amp;nbsp;RIL&rsquo;s refinery at Jamnagar is one of the most complex plants in the world and can process heavier (impurer and cheaper) crude to yield a product slate of the same quality that other refiners produce using lighter (purer and more expensive) crude. Soaring international prices of crude lead to the price differential between light and heavy crude narrowing, since demand for the latter rises as it&rsquo;s cheaper. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Reliance Industry quarterly results 1. The Reliance Industries results for the Q4FY12 have been in-line of the estimates. 2. While most of the parameters have been in-line of the estimates, there is definite positive surprise on the GRM (Gross Refining Margins). While the estimate of GRM was below US&amp;amp;#36; 7 per barrel, the company has posted GRM of US&amp;amp;#36; 7.6 per barrel. That&rsquo;s definitely positive during this quarter. 3. One more interesting aspect of the financials is the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; segment. The relevance of &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; has been substantially increasing with each passing quarter. The company has huge cash pile of about Rs 70,252 Crores. This is resulting into huge &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; on the ample cash balances on the balance sheet of about Rs 2,295 Crores. 4. Just to put the things in perspective regarding the growing significance of &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; in the performance of Reliance, would like to mention a quick statistic. Profit Before Tax of the company is about Rs 5,431 Crores and &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; is about Rs 2,295 Crore. That means, about 42% of Profit Before Tax is coming from the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot;. I can't think of any other company of the size of Reliance who gets such a massive proportion of Profit from &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot;. 5. To put in other words, the &amp;quot;core business&amp;quot; of the company is contributing just about 58% of the Profit Before Tax and the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; is contributing about 42% of the Profit Before Tax. 6. To summarize, Reliance is making more and more money out of money, less and less money out of oil. 7. Probably, it is high time that the company has to clearly pronounce the cash deployment plan regarding how are they going to use Rs 70,252 Crores. Else, this factor may remain to be huge overhang on the performance of the stock.

RIL, after ruling out any amicable settlement on the dispute, has knocked the doors of the Supreme Court.  Find out what eventually led the energy giant to approach the apex court In January 2011, RIL had said it will hit peak output of 80 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) from 60 mmscmd from its eastern offshore KG-DG fields in FY2012-13. But in February 2011, it issued a statement saying that&amp;amp;nbsp;the output from KG D6 has slipped due to technical problems to about 52 mmscmd. In the same month, RIL roped in British Energy giant BP which picked up 30% stake in 23 of RIL&rsquo;s oil blocks including the big gas producer D6 in the KG basin. While announcing this, RIL had said, it will use BP's technical expertise to boost output at DG block. But, even after the tie-up, output declined almost 20% month-on-month and remained pretty much stagnant in the following months. RIL expressed inability to firm up appropriate drilling locations due to geological complexities at the basin. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGK) blamed RIL for drilling fewer wells as against the 31 approved under&amp;amp;nbsp;the field development plan.&amp;amp;nbsp;Despite RIL's repeated argument that technical glitches were leading to a decline in their&amp;amp;nbsp;output, the DGH remained unfazed. June 2011 onwards, the blame game between the government and&amp;amp;nbsp; RIL intensified&amp;amp;nbsp;wherein RIL kept pointing out at excessive water/sand ingress as reasons for declining output, and the government maintained that RIL neither drilled the remaining nine oil producing wells nor took any alternative action such as revisions of the field development plan as per the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract. The PSC mentions that RIL would start sharing profits after it had recovered 100% of its drilling costs. But peeved at the way RIL was functioning, the ministry sratred moving toward restricting the 100% cost-recovery clause. Instead, it&amp;amp;nbsp;wanted to modify the existing clause and share profits in proportion to gas output from the KG-D6 fields.  But RIL, according to reports,&amp;amp;nbsp;communicated to the oil ministry that as per the PSC it should be allowed to recover 100% of its exploration and production costs and the government should not link cost-recovery to output. RIL argued that it had envisaged a gas output of 80 mmcmd by 2012 from an investment of &amp;amp;#36;8.8 billion. However, it could invest only &amp;amp;#36;5.8 billion so far and output is only about half of the desired target. To protect its interest, RIL sent an arbitration notice to the oil ministry, which the latter ignored citing it as non-event."

R K Global estimates on Reliance Industries for Q4FY12: Revenue to grow 2.8% Y-o-Y We estimate RIL to post net revenue of `747059mn during Q4FY12, reporting 2.8% Y-o-Y growth. The subdued growth in revenue is attributed to production decline in its refinery segment primarily on account of 3 week maintenance shutdown of one crude distillation unit at its SEZ refinery this quarter. We expect RIL&rsquo;s crude throughput to be at 15.3MMT this quarter as against 16.7MMT in Q4FY11. We see petchem volumes to be lower this quarter at 4.8MMT as against 5.2MMT. Subdued refinery and petchem margins to impact profitability Decline in Arab L-H differentials and weakness in distillate cracks will continue to put pressure on the refining margins in Asia-Pac region. We expect RIL&rsquo;s refinery margin to be at USD 7.6/bbl for this quarter. While in petchem segment, margin pressure was felt in PE and PP while PVC margins saw some improvement. We expect RIL&rsquo;s Operating Profit and Net Profit to decline 28.9% Y-o-Y and 32.0% Y-o-Y to Rs 76555mn and Rs 36571mn respectively.

We expect RIL to report net profit of INR40.9b (v/s INR53.8b in 4QFY11 and INR44.4b in 3QFY12).

Crude oil saw a signficant increase during the quarter, with Brent oil prices averaging at US&amp;amp;#36;118.5/bbl. Prices were high on account of geopolitical tension building between Iran and Western countries. GRMs witnessed marginal contraction on account of weakness in the distillates cracks. In the Petchem segment, global cracker margins improved, while the pressure was felt in PE and PP margins. The PVC margins witnessed an improvement.  Crude oil witnessed significant increase during the quarter, with Brent oil prices increasing to an average of US&amp;amp;#36;118.5/bbl, with prices ranging between US&amp;amp;#36;108- 126/bbl. The main drivers of the oil prices were supply-led concerns, led by Iran-EU tension over oil sanction and Sudan-South Sudan dispute over transit fees. EU has banned Iranian crude imports at the end of January 2012 and gave six months grace period for the EU members to end oil contract by July 1. In response, Iran warned to close the Strait of Hormuz, the main crude shipping lanes and prepared to stop oil exports to the EU immediately. The action has tightened crude oil market as the EU usually imports crude from Iran at around 400-500 thousand barrels per day. Light-heavy differentials declined on a QoQ basis, with AH-AL spread averaging at US&amp;amp;#36;3.3/bbl as against US&amp;amp;#36;3.9/bbl. The spreads between Dubai Fateh-AH declined to US&amp;amp;#36;(0.7)/bbl as against US&amp;amp;#36;0.5/bbl in the previous quarter. The same is likely to adversely impact the performance of RIL as the premium over the Singapore GRMS is likely to further decline in the current quarter as RIL procures heavy grade of the crude with API similar to Arab Heavy crude.

RIL-BP propose to drill one gas production well on the MA oilfield in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block besides intervention jobs in at least two of the existing six wells on the fields, sources privy to the development said. MA is the only oil find made by RIL in the 7,645 square kilometre KG-D6 block. The field produces about 11,200 barrels a day of along and associated gas of 6.45 million cubic meters per day. MA field makes up for about one-fifth of the 34.09 mmcmd of current gas output from KG-D6 block. Sources said six wells had been drilled on MA field, of which one had to be closed because of water loading and sand ingress. RIL-BP plan to do workover (intervention activity involving invasive techniques to raise output) on the closed well and at least one more well facing similar problems. This together with a seventh well, which would only produce gas unlike the current five wells that produce both oil and gas, would help the field raise output to 8 mmcmd. MA field had begun oil production in September 2008 and gas in April 2009 and in 2010 had averaged 8 mmcmd of gas output. Sources said the revised FDP for MA field was submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) in February and RIL-BP have made technical presentation.  Also, RIL-BP are working on an integrated and capital efficient plan for block development, involving production from all the 18 gas discoveries in KG-D6. They projected first gas from R-Series, the third largest gas find in KG-D6 block, by 2015 and production from satellite fields by 2016 subject to timely regulatory approvals. RIL began production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields, the largest among the 18 gas and one oil find, in April 2009 but output has fallen from a peak of 54 million cubic meters per day in March 2010 to 27.64 mmcmd this month. Together with 6.45 mmcmd of gas production from D-26 or MA oil field in the same area, block output is 34.09 mmcmd. The plan would help in cost savings of over USD 1 billion due to integration and optimisation. In addition, un-incurred phase-II cost of D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 field development plan (USD 3.1 billion out of total cost of USD 8.8 billion) would not be required to be spent, they said. Sources said RIL-BP plan to connect R-Series and four satellite fields, for which a USD 1.529 billion field development plan was approved by the government in January, to the existing infrastructure used to produce gas from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and MA. Also, other satellite fields would be hooked up to these. R-series and four satellite fields alone have potential to add 30 mmscmd of output.&amp;amp;nbsp;"

The Canadian firm in a statement said it expects a drop in reserves at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3), the largest of the 18 gas finds in KG-D6 block. &amp;quot;Production performance at the D1/D3 fields within the D6 block indicates the need for a revision to the current geological model. While analysis continues, Niko anticipates a drop in its reserves for the D1/D3 fields,&amp;quot; the company said without giving details. D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 had previously been stated to hold about 11 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. Niko, which holds 10% stake in the RIL-operated KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block off the Andhra coast, had last month stated that gas production in the October-December quarter from the D6 block averaged 40.49 million cubic meters per day, as compared to 55.21 mmcmd in the year-ago period. D6 gas production in December averaged approximately 137 mmcfd (38.79 mmcmd for the entire block), Niko had said. &amp;quot;Declines are expected to continue until workovers are completed and/or additional wells are tied in,&amp;quot; it had added. The current output is less than half of the peak 80 mmcmd that RIL had projected as fewer wells were drilled than planned and seven wells ceased to produce due to the entry of sand or water. RIL has so far drilled 22 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 but only 18 were put on production. Of these, six have ceased due to water/sand ingress. The company is to do workovers or maintenance of these well, which may raise the output, Niko said. MA oilfield in the same block had seen one out of the five wells cease due to the same reasons. The Canadian firm today said plans were approved for the development of the first four satellite discoveries around the currently producing D1&amp;amp;amp;D3. Besides sizeable production would come when R-Series fields in the block are developed. &amp;quot;On the positive side, as development plans are approved, Niko contemplates additional reserves from the R complex, satellite fields and full block development,&amp;quot; Niko said.&amp;amp;nbsp; These fields can add up to 30 mmcmd to the output. RIL holds 60% interest in the 7,645-sq-km D6 block after farming-out 30% stake in BP Plc of UK.

The pre-Budget policy document said gas production from KG-D6 fields during April-December 2011-12 was about 12.36 billion cubic meters against the production of 15.82 BCM during the same period in 2010-11. &amp;quot;The gas production has reportedly decreased due to drop in pressure in the wells and increased water ingress leading to lower output of gas per well,&amp;quot; it said. Drop in KG-D6 production pulled down nation's gas output during first nine months of the current fiscal to 36.19 BCM as compared to 39.68 BCM during the same period last year. &amp;quot;The projected production for natural gas, including coal bed methane (CBM) for 2011-12 is 51.67 (BCM), which is 1.05% lower than the actual production of 52.22 BCM in 2010-11,&amp;quot; it said. During the current fiscal, production of crude oil is estimated at 38.19 million tonnes, which is about 1.33% higher than the 37.70 million tonnes produced during 2010-11. Domestic crude oil production during April-December was 28.70 million tonnes showing a growth of 1.9% over the same period of the previous year. Oil production from Cairn India's prolific Rajasthan block was 4.80 million tonnes in nine months of current fiscal against total production of 5.148 million tons during full 2010-11 fiscal. The Survey said a total of USD 15.88 billion investment has been made in 235 blocks awarded in eight auction rounds under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) since 1999. &amp;quot;Under NELP 103 oil and gas discoveries have been made by private/joint venture (JV) companies in 34 blocks and more than 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent hydrocarbon reserves have been added,&amp;quot; it said. India has the fourth largest proven coal reserves in the world and holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. Under the CBM policy, 33 exploration blocks, the Survey said, adding 8.92 Trillion cubic feet output of prognosticated resources of about 92 Tcf, have sofar been established. &amp;quot;Commercial production of CBM in India has now become a reality with current CBM gas production of about 0.23 million cubic metre per day,&amp;quot; it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The document said shale gas can emerge as an important new source of energy in the country.

The contract for eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block provides for all actual expenditure incurred to be first recovered from sale of oil/gas before profits are split between the contractor and the government. Reddy said RIL has claimed USD 9.47 billion in cost of developing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields, MA oilfield and exploration in the 7,645 sq km block in Bay of Bengal. Of this, it has recovered USD 5.26 billion even though the Management Committee, which overseas operations of the block, has approved only USD 3.99 billion cost recovery up to 2007-08 fiscal. &amp;quot;While contractor (RIL) has claimed an expenditure of USD 9.47 billion and cost recovered USD 5.26 billion up to 2010-11, the MC has approved only USD 3.99 billion up to financial year 2007-08,&amp;quot; he said in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha. Of the USD 9.47 billion, RIL and its partners had incurred USD 5.7 billion in developing D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields and another USD 1.73 billion in bringing MA oilfield into production. &amp;quot;The audited accounts are placed before MC for adopting the same as provided under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). MC has approved the said audited accounts upto the year 2007-08,&amp;quot; he added without details of accounts of subsequent years. The auditors appointed by the Government had audited accounts of KG-D6 block up to 2006-07. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) carried out a special audit of the block for 2006-07 and 2007-08 and has agreed to conduct regular audit for the block for 2008-09. Reddy said while CAG in report had observed that large procurement contracts were given on single bid basis, the top auditor &amp;quot;has not quantified any loss of revenue to the Government.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The report of the CAG is under consideration of Public Accounts Committee (PAC),&amp;quot; he added.&amp;amp;nbsp; Natural gas production at KG-D6 has fallen to about 35-36 million standard cubic meters per day from 61.5 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. While RIL says output has fallen because of fall in reservior pressure and ingress of water and sand in wells, the oil ministry and its technical arm Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) believes it is due to the company drilling less number of wells.  &amp;quot;DGH under this ministry has reported that the reasons for lower gas production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in the block KG-DWN-98/3 may be attributed to drilling of less number of development wells (producers) as compared to that envisaged in the MC approved Addendum to Initial Development Plan,&amp;quot; Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singhsaid in reply to a separate question.  In addition, six out of 18 producing wells in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields have ceased to produce gas due to water loading/sand ingress, he said. In case of MA field in the same block, one oil/gas producing well out of six oil/gas producing wells has also ceased due to water loading in the well, he said.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;As per approved AIDP, contractor is required to drill, complete and put on production total 22 wells by March 2011 and 31 wells by March 2012. &amp;quot;The contractor has, however, drilled total 22 wells so far, out of which 18 wells were put on production. Balance four wells are to be completed or connected for production,&amp;quot; he added. RIL, he said, has been asked to &amp;quot;increase the gas production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields by adopting appropriate measures such as well drilling, well intervention etc.&amp;quot; "

RIL currently buys 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) or 4 million tonnes a year crude from Rajasthan, that it processes at its old 33 million tonnes a year domestic tariff area (DTA) refinery on the West Coast. It has now applied to the government to buy another 30,000 bpd of Cairn crude for turning it into fuel at its 29 million tonnes SEZ (Special Economic Zone) refinery adjacent to the old unit. Official sources said the company's request would be considered by the Board of Approval, headed by Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar, next week. Any sale to a SEZ or only-for-exports unit is considered outward shipment or exports out of India. The current policy does not allow export of domestically produced crude oil. RIL's request comes just when Cairn is beginning to ramp up production from Rajasthan fields. Cairn currently produces 125,000 barrels per day from Mangala oilfield, the largest find in the Rajasthan block. Another 20,000 bpd is produced from Bhagyam fields. Mangala can go up to 150,000 bpd or 7.5 million tonnes a year anytime now while Bhagyam has an approved peak of 40,000 bpd and can go up to 60,000 bpd with more investments. Sources said Cairn currently sells 15,000-20,000 bpd to state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and another 30,000-40,000 bpd to Essar Oil. RIL's refinery complex at Jamnagar, consisting of the old DTA refinery and an SEZ unit, are connected by a heated pipeline to the Mangala field in Rajasthan. Rajasthan crude is very heavy with API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity between 25-30. Also, waxiness of the crude turns it into solid at room temperature. Transportation of the Rajasthan crude therefore, requires special heating arrangements in the pipeline to keep the crudein a liquid form. Most Indian domestic refineries lack the configuration to process Rajasthan crude due to its quality. Others face logistical issues. Sources said RIL's SEZ refinery, which is designed to process far heavier crudes, is unable to use Rajasthan crude as the same has been classified as a restricted item under the current Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) provisions. The unit has, therefore, sought approval of the BoA for the importing crude oil from Cairn India. "

RIL had on January 6 written to the Oil Ministry and the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) seeking a gas price revision, saying the current USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit rate for KG-D6 gas was &amp;quot;sub-market&amp;quot; price compared with three times higher price being paid for imported gas (LNG). The PMO subsequently asked the oil ministry to legally examine if the government can allow RIL to increase the price. The government had in 2007 fixed USD 4.20 per mmBtu as the price of gas produced from KG-D6 fields for first five years of production. KG-D6 fields started production in 2009. But the Oil Ministry's letter on October 10, 2007, informing RIL of the pricing decision did not stop at this and went on to state that if the company was to realise a price higher than USD 4.20 per mmBtu, then that rate would be used for determining government's take from KG-D6 block. Sources said it is perplexing why this clause was inserted if the gas price was to be USD 4.2 per mmBtu for five years as the Oil Ministry is insisting now. RIL had originally proposed a rate of over USD 4.3 per mmBtu for first three years of production which was later tweeked by an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) to USD 4.2 per mmBtu for five years. &amp;quot;If the actual price at which any supplies made to any consumer happens to be higher than the one arrived at by (the formula approved by the EGoM), then the higher price shall be taken for purposes of the Government take for that quantity,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote to RIL on October 10, 2007. This clause in the oil ministry letter may be the reason behind RIL's January 6 letter seeking revision of &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sub-market&amp;quot; price for KG-D6. Sources said the ministry is not inclined to accept RIL request on the grounds that RIL had accepted to keep price stable at USD 4.2 per mmBtu for five years. It is also relying on the Supreme Court's May 7, 2010 judgement in the gas row between RIL and Anil Ambani's RNRL that stated that government alone has the right to fix the selling price of gas from all fields including KG-D6. When the nation can pay USD 12-14 per mmBtu price to overseas producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the domestic gas producers too deserve an equivalent price. While high imported LNG price gives no incentive to the government, a higher domestic price would fetch it higher revenues in form of royalty, taxes and profit petroleum."

The D6 gas output has been declining for more than a year, resulting in a sharp fall in India's gas output and forcing the country to resort to increased imports of expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet demands of its expanding economy. Gas output, currently around 37-38 million standard cubic meters a day (mscmd), may average 27.60 mscmd in the fiscal year starting April, about 66% lower than initially estimated, a government source said earlier this month. &amp;quot;It will maximise use of the entire existing infrastructure to produce the balance of the discoveries and minimize new infrastructure needed,&amp;quot; BP India head Sashi Mukundan told reporters. A single development plan for the entire KG D6 block, compared to current norm of field-wise plans, will bring more certainty and comfort to customers, he said. BP acquired stake in 23 oil and gas blocks in India, some in the KG block, from Reliance Industries in a USD 7.2 billion deal last year. The two companies aim to boost production to a sustainable level from both the existing fields and the next wave of developments -- D6 satellites &amp;amp;amp; R Series and the NEC-25. Reliance, India's biggest company by market value, has been under pressure from the government and investors because of the falling gas output, and its market value tumbled 35% in 2011, underperforming the main Mumbai market. Earlier, Mukundan said the British oil and gas major wanted a predictable pricing regime for natural gas in India, as this is vital for developing future projects in the country. &amp;quot;Clarity on gas pricing is vital for the development of the 'next wave' of projects, which will add production beyond 2015 but for which investment decisions need to be made now,&amp;quot; he said at an event. Gas prices in India are set between USD 4 to USD 6 per million British thermal units (MBTU) but are far below double-digit prices globally, in part to be competitive with cheap local coal.

In this year it fell to 37 mmcmd. In this regard, we are going to issue notice (to Reliance),&amp;quot; Reddy told reports during his maiden visit to KG-Basin. The Oil Ministry and its technical arm - the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) - blame the fall in output from KG-D6 fields to 34.5 million cubic meters per day instead of 70.39 mmcmd planned for now, and 80 mmcmd by April, due to RIL drilling fewer wells than it had committed. The ministry is consulting with legal experts on sending the notice to RIL and will go through the normal legal process, Reddy had said last week. DGH wants USD 1.235 billion, out of the USD 5.7 billion expenditure already made in KG-D6, to be disallowed as RIL has drilled and completed only 18 wells as against the agreed upon 31 wells in the block, resulting in lower gas output. Anticipating such a move, RIL had on November 24 slapped an arbitration notice saying the Production Sharing Contract allows 100 per cent of the expenses to be recovered and has no provision to restrict cost recovery in proportion to output. RIL says it has not drilled the committed number of wells as the reservoir has not behaved as predicted and output dipped due to a fall in pressure and water and sand ingress in wells."

RIL, in a status report filed with the Oil Ministry, stated that natural gas production from the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields and the MA oilfield in Block KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6, in the Krishna-Godavari Basin of the Bay of Bengal, was 35.77 mmscmd in the week ended February 5. Sources said the output dipped to 34.5 mmscmd in the subsequent week. The output during January 30 to February 5 comprised of 29.22 mmscmd from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields and 6.55 mmscmd from the MA oilfield. The KG-D6 production is lower than 61.5 mmscmd rate achieved in March, 2010, before a drop in pressure in the wells and increased water and sand ingress pulled down per-well gas output. The report said of the 18 wells drilled, completed and put on production in the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, six wells -- A2, A6, A10, B1, B2 and B13, were kept closed due to high water cut/sanding issues. Sources said till last month 13 wells were producing and a sixth well -- A6 -- was shut recently. In its projections for next two fiscal, RIL has stated that the KG-D6 output will fall further to 27.60 mmscmd in 2012-13 and to 22.60 mmscmd in 2013-14. This will be the lowest production level since RIL began production from KG-D6 block in April 2009. Sources said RIL in its projections has stated that output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 in 2012-13 would be 20.20 mmscmd and another 7.40 mmscmd will come from MA oilfield. In the subsequent year, production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 would further drop to 14 mmscmd, while MA oilfield is expected to produce 8.60 mmscmd. The output from KG-D6 is short of the 70.39 mmscmd (61.88 mmscmd from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and 8.5 mmscmd from MA field) level envisaged by now as per the field development plan approved in 2006. Production was to touch 80 mmscmd by April, 2012 after all the 31 wells envisaged in the development plan are drilled and brought to production. RIL has so far drilled 22 wells on Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas finds in the KG-D6 block that have been brought to production, but only 18 were put-on production. Of these 18, six have ceased due to water/sand ingress. MA oilfield in the same block had seen one out of the five wells cease due to the same reasons. RIL is the operator of the 7,645-sq-km D6 block with 60 per cent stake while London-based BP plc has 30 per cent interest. The remaining is with Niko Resources of Canada. According to RIL status report, the MA oilfield, where one of the five oil wells had been shut due to water loading, produced about 11,882 barrels of crude oil per day in the week ending February 5. In addition, 1,578 barrels of condensate are produced from the field every day. The report said 14.66 mmscmd of the gas output was sold to fertiliser plants and 18.02 mmscmd to power plants. The remaining 3.09 mmscmd was consumed by other sectors, including compressors and internal use of the East-West pipeline that transports gas from the East Coast to consumption centres in the West. Niko had last week warned that KG-D6 fields may see a further decline in output until new wells are brought to production. The Canadian firm said its share of D6 gas production in December averaged approximately 137 million cubic feet per day mmcfd (38.79 mmscmd for the entire block). &amp;quot;Declines are expected to continue until work overs are completed and/or additional wells are tied in,&amp;quot; it said, adding that RIL was to do workovers or maintenance of the six closed wells which may raise the output."

The sixth well was shut last week, the source with direct knowledge of the development, said. Reliance, the operator of the D6 block, had earlier shut five of 18 producing wells at D1 and D3 gas fields until December. Declining gas output from the D6 block has impacted expansion plans of many power companies, and spurred demand for costly liquefied natural gas imports. Gas output from D6 may average 22.6 million standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) in the fiscal year starting April 2013 from the current 37-38 mmscmd, a government source said on Thursday. Shares of Reliance closed 2.9% lower in a week Mumbai market. The gas output may fall to 27.60 mmscmd in 2012/13, about 66% lower than initial estimate. Reliance has informed the upstream regulator, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), that output from D1 and D3 gas fields may fall to 14 mmscmd and that from MA field would be 8.60 mmscmd in the year beginning April 2013, the source said. Reliance last year brought in the offshore expertise of BP , which paid USD 7.2 billion to invest in 23 oil and gas blocks with the Indian firm, to help it arrest the decline. Reliance and BP are jointly studying the reservoir profile of D1 and D3 fields. &amp;quot;The study should be completed by July-August. The output cannot be predicted now,&amp;quot; said the first source. Currently, the only hope to produce more gas is linked to the development of four satellite fields and R-1 gas discovery at the block. The satellite fields are estimated to hold about 0.6 trillion cubic feet (TCF) gas reserves. Reliance, which earlier this year got approval to develop the four satellite fields, plans to produce gas from these facilities around 2015. &amp;quot;Initial production will be less but in 2-3 years it will touch a peak rate of 10 mmscmd. The plateau production will last for 6 year,&amp;quot; the source said. Reliance's efforts to raise output of D6 block are restricted due to narrow window of fair weather in the east coast. The DGH recently approved Reliance's R-1 gas discovery as commercially viable. Reliance has one year to submit field development plans of the discovery estimated to hold 1.6 TCF gas reserves. Canadian oil and gas producer Niko Resources Ltd, which holds 10% in the Reliance-operated D6 block and posted a quarterly loss due to the reduced production in the block, earlier this month warned that output decline could continue at the site."

The Oil Ministry had on October 10, 2007, written to RIL fixing USD 4.20 per million British thermal unit as the price of gas from KG-D6 fields for first five years of production, informed sources said. The letter however did not stop at this and went on to state that if RIL was to realise a price higher than USD 4.20 per mmBtu, that rate would be used for determining government's take from KG-D6 block. &amp;quot;If the actual price at which any supplies made to any consumer happens to be higher than the one arrived at by (the formula approved by the Empowered Group of Ministers), then the higher price shall be taken for purposes of the Government take for that quantity,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote to RIL on October 10, 2007. It is perplexing why this clause was inserted if the gas price was to be USD 4.2 per mmBtu for five years as the Oil Ministry is insisting now. Sources said the ministry's has prepared a draft reply rejecting RIL's demand for revision in KG-D6 price citing a letter the company wrote on October 24, 2007 accepting the terms set out in the government's October 10, 2007 letter. But the ministry's October 10, 2007 letter alluding to RIL realising a price higher than the one fixed by the EGoM headed by the then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, is equivocal. This may be the reason behind RIL's January 6 letter to the ministry seeking revision of &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sub-market&amp;quot; price for KG-D6, where gas production started in April 2009. It cited liquefied natural gas (LNG) being imported by public sector firms at triple the KG-D6 price to seek a revision. Sources said the ministry's draft rejecting reopening of price before 2014, also relies on the Supreme Court's May 7, 2010 judgement in the gas row between RIL and Anil Ambani's RNRL that stated that government alone has the right to fix the selling price of gas from all fields including KG-D6. RIL, they said, has never questioned the right of the government to approve the gas price and it does not propose to sell fuel without government approval. It has approached the ministry with a request for review of the gas price and would sell the fuel at higher rates only after its nod. Stating that the current price of gas was no longer viable, the company had in the January 6 given the government 90 days to reach an &amp;quot;amicable settlement&amp;quot; over gas pricing. Under the dispute resolution process detailed in the Production Sharing Contract, parties are required to try for reconciliation of differences for three months before heading for arbitration. RIL may be thinking of arbitration on the issue."

We are ready and willing to provide all three.&amp;quot; A government panel on Tuesday approved allowing India's cash-starved airlines to import their own jet fuel, a move that could help them cut fuel costs -- which account for about half of their operation costs -- by up to 20 percent. The decision, which needs cabinet approval, will allow airlines to avoid various federal and state taxes levied by state-run oil firms, but will require carriers to set up extensive infrastructure to store and transport the fuel. Indian airlines are likely to lose up to USD 3 billion in the fiscal year ending March, according to the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, as carriers struggle due to high fuel costs, cutthroat competition and a slowdown in the economy. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

But RIL says raising the price to&amp;amp;nbsp;USD 6 per unit is a viable option as they have run into cost overruns on the project. It may be recalled that RIL had written to the ministry late last year that it is the only gas company which is sharing profits with the government on selling gas from KG-D6 at USD 4.20 per unit. The energy giant had also contended that it has not yet recovered cost on this project and hence it needs to hike the price of the gas It also pointed out in a communication with the ministry that there are public run companies like ONGC who do not split any profits with the government and hence they should be treated at par with private companies like theirs. Hence, to resolve this cost recovery issue so as not to hinder future investments in this block, the company has begun arbitration proceedings against the government. Under the KG-D6 production sharing contract (PSC) signed between RIL and the government, RIL was allowed to recover the complete expenditure that it had incurred to develop the fields before it started splitting its profits with the government.  However, RIL said that&amp;amp;nbsp; production from the field is receding and it need to cover up its cost. So far, RIL has incurred a capex of around &amp;amp;#36;5.8 billion, of which it has recovered up to &amp;amp;#36;5.2 billion for a targeted production of 60 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of gas, said the head of research of a leading international brokerage.

RIL, in an advertisement issued in national and regional dailies, asked consumers to quote a figure in US dollars per million British thermal units that can be added to the price at which Petronet LNG ships gas in its liquid state (liquefied natural gas or LNG) from Qatar under a long-term contract. While its eastern offshore KG-D6 gas price is fixed at USD 4.205 per mmBtu for the five years ending March 31, 2014, RIL had on September 16 demanded that coal bed methane (CBM) it plans to produce from its Sohagpur block in Madhya Pradesh should be priced by the same formula as Petronet's Qatar LNG deal. It had sought 12.67 per cent of the average price of crude oil imported into Japan (called Japan Crude Cocktail, or JCC) plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. Petronet pays RasGas of Qatar a price of 12.67 per cent of JCC, besides incurring a USD 0.26 per mmBtu cost on transporting the gas in ships. At a USD 100 per barrel JCC average, CBM -- according to RIL's September formula -- would cost USD 12.67 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, totalling USD 12.93 per mmBtu.&amp;amp;nbsp;Great Eastern Energy Corp (GEECL) is selling CBM produced from its Raniganj block in West Bengal at USD 6.79 per mmBtu, while domestically produced natural gas is priced at USD 4.2 to USD 5.73 per mmBtu. Essar Oil has proposed a price of USD 4.20 per mmBtu for its CBM. RIL, in today's advertisement, has retained the pricing formula and asked users to quote a positive or negative number that can be added to this pricing formula. The company is also demanding a marketing margin of USD 0.15 per mmBtu from CBM users, even though its USD 0.135 per mmBtu marketing margin charged on KG-D6 gas has been sent to oil regulator PNGRB for review. Sources said the Oil Ministry was reluctant to approve the price sought by RIL in September last year as nowhere in the world is domestic gas priced at LNG rates. Moreover, LNG costs more than domestic gas because of the huge investment that goes into putting up a liquefaction plant that turns natural gas into a liquid state by cooling it at sub-zero temperatures so that it can be shipped. The ministry scoffed at the price sought by RIL as RasGas supplies gas rich in ethane (C2) and propane (C3), which are useful in the manufacture of LPG and petrochemicals. On the other hand, CBM is just methane (C1) with no properties to make LPG/chemicals. RIL, in today's advertisement, said it will produce a peak output of 3.5 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the Sohagpur blocks by the second half of 2014."

RIL would buy back up to 12 crore equity shares worth Rs 10,440 crore from the open market at a maximum price of Rs 870 apiece in its first share buyback since 2005.  &amp;quot;The buyback is expected to increase shareholder value.

The shares were quoted at Rs 781.80, higher by 1.40 per cent, on the BSE. Analysts said share buyback could be aimed at helping the stock regain its lost glory, given their sharp plunge of 35 per cent last year, against a fall of about 24 per cent in the market benchmark Sensex. Shares of the company had tumbled by 3 per cent on Monday after the company reported its first drop in quarterly profit in more than two years due to falling refining margins. Analysts had also attributed to the fall in share price to size of the buyback, which represented 3.7 per cent of the company's equity capital. RIL had in December, 2004, offered to buyback 10 per cent of its equity at Rs 570 per share. "

I. On Quarterly Results 1. The Reliance Industry results for the Q3 FY 12 have been below estimates, in terms of several operational metrics. 2. It seems that the company had challenging quarter in terms of GRM (Gross Refining Margins), Gas Output, PetChem margins, etc. 3. However, the positive surprise came from the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; segment, as the company was surely benefitted by the treasury income on the ample cash balances on the balance sheet of Rs 74,539 Crores. The &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; has increaed from Rs 741 Crores (in Dec 2010 quarter) to Rs 1717 Crores (in Dec 2011 quarter), showing a jump of 131.7%. 4. Hence, it can be said that, whatever profitability squeeze that company was facing on the operational front, is being compensated to some extent by the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot;. 5. Just to put the things in perspective regarding the growing significance of &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; in the performance of Reliance, would like to mention a quick statistic. The &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; in the current quarter constitutes 30% of the Profit Before Tax. That is quite a significant percentage for the size of the P&amp;amp;amp;L of Reliance. 6. To put in other words, the &amp;quot;operational business&amp;quot; of the company is contributing about 70% of the Profit Before Tax and the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; is contributing about 30% of the Profit Before Tax. 7. Further, if one observes the segmental reporting, the share of three core operational business in profit before tax is as follows: Petro Chemicals (Rs 2,157 Crores), Refining (Rs 1,685 Crores) and Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas (Rs 1,294 Crores). Whereas the Other Income is at Rs 1,717 Crores. Meaning thereby, the Other Income is contributing more than the core business segments of Refining, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas. 8. To summarize, Reliance is making more and more money out of money, less and less money out of oil. II. On the Buyback 1. The details of buyback announcement by Reliance in terms of the Buyback size (at Rs 10,440 Crores) and Buyback price (at Rs 870 per share) are in line with our estimates. 2. The modus operandi the company has choosen for buyback is &amp;quot;Open Market Purchase&amp;quot;. 3. Hence, the company will buy the shares from the open market, at the market prices. Meaning thereby, the maximum buyback price of Rs 870 per share is only &amp;quot;maximum buyback price&amp;quot; and not necessarily &amp;quot;actual buyback price&amp;quot;. 4. However, this buyback will surely provide the sentimental boost that the company is ready to buy the shares if the share price of the company comes down sharply. 5. As far as the stock price performance is concerned, it seems that the challenging impact of results may overshadow the positive impact of the buyback.

The company, India's biggest by market capitalisation, has approached Den Networks , Digicable Networks, Hathway Cable and Datacom , IndusInd Media and Communications Ltd. and several independent multi-system operators (MSOs), the report said, quoting two unnamed sources. A Reliance Industries spokesman, told Reuters, that the company was in talks with various operators for partnerships and content deals. He declined to provide further details, including the names of the firms Reliance was in talks with and the nature of discussions, citing confidential clauses. The operators could not be immediately contacted by Reuters for comments. Unlisted Infotel Broadband Services Ltd. is Reliance's vehicle for its telecom space foray. Earlier in January, Reliance said it would invest in media group TV18's two main companies, marking a major foray into the media sector by the energy-focused conglomerate and giving a boost to its plans to launch 4G services. There are more than 6,000 cable operators in the country, Business Standard said in its report. In 2010, Reliance Industries, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani had agreed to buy Infotel Broadband, making his return to telecom after the business was handed over to younger sibling Anil following a family spilt. Reliance Industries had paid about 48 billion rupees for fresh equity in Infotel to get a 95 percent stake."

In a letter to RIL executive director P. M. S. Prasad, on Thursday, the Ministry wrote that the question of the quantum of marketing margin applicable on sale of gas by any marketer has since been considered in the Ministry and a decision has been taken to refer the matter to the PNGRB.  Earlier the petroleum ministry, which had long held that the marketing margin was a bilateral issue between the buyer and seller of gas, referred it to the PNGRB after user industries like fertilisers sought a clarification on the legality of the levy. The ministry's technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), too, is of the opinion that RIL should share a part of these earnings with the government. It wants the marketing margin to be added to the gas sales price of &amp;amp;#36;4.20 per mmBtu and profit-sharing between the contractor and the government to happen at the combined rate of &amp;amp;#36;4.335 per mmBtu. At present, RIL and the government split profits at the gas sales price of &amp;amp;#36;4.20 per mmBtu after deducting the project cost. However, according to sources, in a letter written to the ministry on December 20, RIL has said that even gas utility GAIL India charges up to &amp;amp;#36;0.18 per mmBtu as a marketing margin on gas it transports and none of it is shared with the government. RIL, while defending its decision to impose a marketing margin over-and-above the government-approved sale price for KG-D6 gas has said that the levy was to cover for the risk and cost associated with marketing of gas. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company has also contested DGH's view, saying the marketing margin was a cost levied beyond the gas delivery flange and as such, was not regulated by the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The PSC provides for fixation of the gas price at the delivery point-- the point at which an upstream operator transfers custody of gas to a marketing and transportation agency. That point for the eastern offshore KG-D6 gas is Kakinada, in Andhra Pradesh, and the government had in 2007 approved a gas price of &amp;amp;#36;4.205 per mmBtu at the delivery point."

The bank has cut its price target for the company to Rs 650 from Rs 921. &amp;quot;We highlight that two of three Reliance's core divisions -- refining and petrochemicals -- face near-term headwinds,&amp;quot; it said in a note. Here are factors that prompted Morgan Stanley to downgrade RIL Weak outlook for GRMs (gross refining margins) and petrochemical netbacks&amp;amp;nbsp; We believe GRMs peaked in 2011 given shutdowns from Japan and a slowdown in additions from China. We reckon the reverse will happen in 2012, with Japan production expected to ramp back up by 2H12, and China and India setting up new capacities. We remain bearish on petrochemicals in the near term as the group will be driven by demand slippage due to global slowdown. RIL has high sensitivity to both the GRMsand petrochemicals. Exploration and Production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) volumes continue to slideFrom a peak of 80 mmscmd (touched briefly for facilities testing purpose) in Dec-09,&amp;amp;nbsp; volume from KG-D6 has slipped to ~40 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day)&amp;amp;nbsp;currently. Although we view this as the bottom for volume slippage, the sale of a 30% stake to BP should lead to a lower contribution from E&amp;amp;amp;P in F2013 as compared to F2012. Earnings growth for the company is tapering off Our prior overweight call on RIL hinged on organic growth at the company across its energy space. We now see short- and medium-term headwinds in all the businesses, however, and have cut our F2012-14e EPS by 9%, 13%, and 19%, respectively. Absolute stock price level seems attractive, but is notRIL is trading at a P/E of 11.5x on our F2013 estimates, implying a ~25% discount to its historical average. However, relative to the market the stock is trading broadly in line with its historical average. In the past, RIL has shown strong earnings growth compared to the current situation of virtually no growth next year.  Cash flow is greater than capexAnd a significant part of incremental cash flows are being driven to non-corebusinesses, which in our view are return dilutive. We estimate both ROCE (returns on capital employed) and RONW (return on net worth) falling from 12.5% and 14.1% in F2011 to 11.45% and 10.8%, respectively, in F2014."

Oil prices resilient, but Singapore GRM down 15% QoQ to USD7.8/bbl: Amidst continued European/MENA/Iran crisis, Brent crude averaged USD110/bbl (USD102- 116/bbl range) in 3QFY12 v/s USD113/bbl in 2QFY12. The regional benchmark Reuters Singapore GRM averaged USD7.8/bbl v/s USD9.1/bbl in 2QFY12. The decline was led by sharp fall in gasoline and naphtha cracks. However, we expect GRMs to remain in the range of USD7-9/bbl in the medium term, as shutdown of ~2.5mbpd capacity would help absorb new capacity coming up in 2012-13. Petchem spreads (except PVC) sustain, but volume sustenance at risk post 21% QoQ jump in 2QFY12: In polymers, PE and PP spreads over naphtha were up 2-9% QoQ but PVC spread was down 39% QoQ (at decade-low levels). Integrated polyester spreads were up 2-5% QoQ. Post the double-digit QoQ volume growth in 2QFY12, sustenance is at risk (amidst continued supplies from the Middle East); we suspect that producers might have given discounts over the list price to sell. Ad-hoc under-recovery sharing to continue in 3Q; full-year under-recoveries to cross INR1.3t: We expect under-recoveries to increase 56% QoQ to INR336b, led by high oil prices, increased international diesel prices and rupee depreciation. Under-recovery sharing would again be ad-hoc, and like the previous years, would be finalized in the last quarter. We model upstream sharing at 40%/38.8% and downstream sharing at 2%/ 10% for FY12/FY13, with the balance being the government's share. However, given that the government is already reeling under high fiscal burden, we believe there remains upside risk to our FY12 upstream sharing estimate. Valuation and view: With deterioration in the government's fiscal health, ONGC's earnings seem more vulnerable, as upstream share in overall under-recoveries is likely to be higher than our assumption of 40% in FY12. OMC stocks will be under pressure due to uncertain subsidy-sharing, poor GRM and increased borrowing costs, led by delay in compensation from the government. We maintain Neutral on GAIL and GSPL, asoperational earnings are unlikely to surprise positively, led by headwinds for incremental gas availability in India. Strong earnings sustainability augurs well for Petronet LNG. Though RIL has benefited from the rupee depreciation, we maintain Neutral to reflect reduced KG-D6 production, uncertain GRM environment, non-clarity on cash utilization, RoE reaching sub-15% and increased share (80%) of cyclical refining and petchem businesses in earnings. Cairn India, being an upstream pure play, is the largest earnings beneficiary of higher oil prices and rupee depreciation. With the closure of Cairn-Vedanta deal, we expect ramp-up in production and decision on investing in new areas, with huge free cash flows. Also, we await likely reserve upgrade and dividend policy. Our key assumptions: Our crude price assumption for FY12/13/14/long term is USD111.3/100/95/90/bbl. We expect the regional benchmark, Singapore Reuters GRM to remain in the range of USD7-9/bbl in the near term. We model Singapore GRM at USD8.4/bbl in FY12 and USD8.2/ bbl in FY13.

According to the research firm, For Q3FY12, under-recoveries on sale of HSD, SKO and LPG have increased to Rs.300bn as against Rs.214bn in Q2FY12. For Q3FY12, under-recoveries on sale of HSD, SKO and LPG have increased to Rs.300bn as against Rs.214bn in Q2FY12. Although oil prices have marginally averaged lower QoQ, under-recoveries have increased on account of weak rupee averaging at Rs50.8/&amp;amp;#36; in Q3FY12 as against Rs45.8/&amp;amp;#36; in Q2FY12.  There is no clarity on the subsidy sharing mechanism. However for our estimates, we assume 33.3% sharing by upstream companies (Rs.99bn). We also and account for 1HFY12 support of Rs150bn for OMCs announced by government in 3QFY12.&amp;amp;nbsp;  During the quarter, the benchmark refining margins declined to US&amp;amp;#36;6.25/bbl, compared to US&amp;amp;#36;8.8/bbl in 2QFY12 mainly on account of decline in gasoline and naphtha cracks. Also petchem margins too declined sequentially during the quarter on the back of weak demand. For RIL, we factor in lower GRMs for YoY and QoQ at US&amp;amp;#36;7/bbl, on the back of decline in benchmark Singapore refining margins and in light-heavy crude oil differential. Although rupee depreciation would benefit RIL as its product realisations are linked to dollar, decline in core margins for both refining and petchem would result in lower profitability sequentially and highlight possibility of a negative surprise to our net profit estimate of Rs52bn.

Currently, RIL charges &amp;amp;#36;0.135 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) market margin to cover for the risk and cost associated with marketing of gas. The Oil Ministry, which had long held that the marketing margin was a bilateral issue between the buyer and seller of gas, referred it to the EGoM after user industries like fertilisers sought a clarification on the legality of the levy. The ministry's technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), too, is of the opinion that RIL should share a part of these earnings with the government. It wants the marketing margin to be added to the gas sales price of &amp;amp;#36;4.20 per mmBtu and profit-sharing between the contractor and the government to happen at the combined rate of &amp;amp;#36;4.335 per mmBtu. At present, RIL and the government split profits at the gas sales price of &amp;amp;#36;4.20 per mmBtu after deducting the project cost. However, according to sources, in a letter written to the ministry on December 20, RIL has said that even gas utility GAIL India charges up to &amp;amp;#36;0.18 per mmBtu as a marketing margin on gas it transports and none of it is shared with the government. RIL, while defending its decision to impose a marketing margin over-and-above the government-approved sale price for KG-D6 gas has said that the levy was to cover for the risk and cost associated with marketing of gas. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company has also contested DGH's view, saying the marketing margin was a cost levied beyond the gas delivery flange and as such, was not regulated by the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The PSC provides for fixation of the gas price at the delivery point-- the point at which an upstream operator transfers custody of gas to a marketing and transportation agency. That point for the eastern offshore KG-D6 gas is Kakinada, in Andhra Pradesh, and the government had in 2007 approved a gas price of &amp;amp;#36;4.205 per mmBtu at the delivery point.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; "

The interested companies will submit non-binding bids for the 65% stake in the gas distribution company on Tuesday, the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. They declined to be named as the information is not public yet. Two of the sources said Indian energy major Reliance Industries had been keen on acquiring the stake, but a company spokesman denied any interest in the deal. Two European companies are also expected to submit bids, the sources told Reuters. They did not name the companies. BG India, a unit of the British oil and gas company, announced in November it was interested in selling its 65% stake in Gujarat Gas, a western India-focused gas distribution company. BG India, which acquired the stake in 1997, is looking to sell the stake as part of restructuring its asset portfolio. Globally, BG Group focuses on exploration &amp;amp;amp; production activities and liquefied natural gas. &amp;quot;We have started a process aimed at evaluating the potential sale of our interest in GGCL (Gujarat Gas). We will inform the market when we have something to announce,&amp;quot; a BG India spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. Most bids for the Gujarat Gas stake are likely to come around USD 600 million, the sources said, valuing the transaction, including the subsequent mandatory open offer, at close to USD 900 million. A GAIL spokesman was not immediately available for comment, while an Adani group spokeswoman and officials at GSPC could not be reached. Gujarat Gas, set up in 1980, currently supplies piped gas to 317,000 domestic and industrial customers and compressed natural gas to 144,000 users, mostly across Surat, Bharuch and Valsad in the western state of Gujarat. The company also operates a 3,700 kilometre-long gas pipeline network. It reported a net profit of 805 million rupees in July-September, on sales of 6.4 billion rupees. India's current gas demand of 166 million cubic metres a day (mmscmd) is projected to rise to 443 mmscmd by 2017, due to the growing number of power plants, industries and vehicles in Asia's third-largest economy. Slowing gas output from the Krishna Godavari gas fields, off India's east cost, has forced increasing imports of expensive LNG to feed demand in the fast growing economy. On Monday, shares in Gujarat Gas, which has a market value of USD 919 million, ended 0.3% lower at Rs 382 in the main Mumbai market that fell 0.2%."

A) Refining Segment 1) GRM for Q3FY12 would remain in range of &amp;amp;#36;5.9-6.9/bbl. Pressure on middle distillates will continue for remaining period of the year due to addition of new refining capacity in CY12 of 0.8mnbpd across the world. 2) Petcoke &amp;amp;amp; Sulphur spreads are continuously in negative zone and heavy weightage to LPG, Naphtha &amp;amp;amp; gasoline in RIL�s product slate is dragging RIL�s GRM discount to Singapore complex GRM (&amp;amp;#36;7.8/bbl in Q3FY12). 3) Flexibility in reconfiguration of RIL�s refinery product slate is limited to 10% only 4) Arab Heavy- Light differentials are on downward trend (&amp;amp;#36;3.2/bbl in Q3FY12). 5) Domestic gas (KG-D6) is totally replaced by Imported LNG (Contracted+Spot) for refinery captive power plant. Going forward we do not see any domestic gas flow to power plant. B) Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production Segment No positive guidance on gas output from KG-D6. The company has guided for gas production to be in the range of 40-45mmscmd in FY13. Ramp up in gas production is expected only in FY14. The company is negotiating current gas price (&amp;amp;#36;4.2/mmbtu) with government, which is based on crude prices at level of &amp;amp;#36;60/bbl. The company is demanding the revision of the prices to the current crude prices of &amp;amp;#36;110/bbl. Shale gas production is expected to touch 350-400bcf by the end of FY14. The company is also planning to acquire more shale gas assets in US. Q3FY12 avg gas output is seen at 41mmscmd. C) Petrochemical Segment: Polyester &amp;amp;amp; Polymer deltas are showing negative trend during Q3FY12. D) Deal with TV18:-RIL plans to invest in the range of Rs 1700-4000cr in TV18/Network18 promoter group. Network18 and TV18 together are issuingrights worth Rs 4000cr to fund the ETV acquisition.

This is something that RIL has been seeking permission to carry out for over one year. In fact this issue is expected to be discussed at today's meeting of the KGD6 management committee, which is made up of representatives of RIL, BP, DGH and oil ministry.  Even sources at RIL said they have been getting positive feelers from the oil ministry since yesterday on the pre-development issue.&amp;amp;nbsp; The ministry has been saying pre-development is not explicitly permitted in the production sharing contract. But now sources say acknowledges it as an activity RIL and BP need to carry out to increase gas production. As recently as Nov 25, that is two days after invoking arbitration against the government, RIL had once again asked for pre-development approval on a priority basis so that it can meet the Dec-April weather window.

ONGC believes that UD-1 gas discovery in the southern part of its Block KG-DWN-98/2 can produce for 14-15 years with peak of about 20 million cubic meters per day (mmcmd) lasting for five years, official sources said. The company detailed the production profile and the likely investment in the revised proposal for declaring the UD-1 find as commercial (called Declaration of Commerciality). Block KG-DWN-98/2 sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block where drop in reservoir pressure and water/sand ingress has seen output dip by over 35% to just over 39 mmcmd. UD-1 is the deepest gas discovery ever made in the country and ONGC estimates it may hold 4.257 Trillion cubic feet of inplace gas reserves, source said adding the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has accepted the DOC but with lower inplace volumes of 3.938 Tcf. Of the inplace reserves, ONGC estimates 2.55 Tcf can be recovered while DGH puts the figure at 2.315 Tcf. Sources said ONGC plans to drill 11 wells to bring the field to production by 2016-17 with an output of 585 million cubic feet per day (16.5 mmcmd). The production would rise to 715 mmcfd (20.24 mmcmd) in the second year and stay there for five years. Output from the seventh year would start dipping and it would be 86 mmcfd (2.4 mmcmd) in year 15. DGH, they said, found the discovery commercial after considering cumulative production of 2.315 Tcf with recovery of 58.5% for 15 years. It estimated a net present value (NPV) yield for ONGC at USD 200 million after considering USD 2.984 billion of capital investment and another USD 1.77 billion in operating expenses. ONGC has said Development Plan at this stage of the project remains conceptual and may change based on new data. Further as on date, there is no off-the shelf commercial production technology available with any company in the world to produce gas in such deep waters (2,841 meters), sources said adding ONGC believes that technological solutions would be available in next three years. The block KG-DWN-98/2 is divided into two - Northern Discovery Area and the Southern Discovery Area. The northern part has nine discoveries - Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1, R-1 (Annapurna), E-1, A1, U1, W1 and D-1/KT-1. The southern part holds the UD-1 discovery at a record depth of 2,841 metres."
