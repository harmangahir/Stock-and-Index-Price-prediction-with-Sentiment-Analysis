Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;had announced that it would launch commercial 4G telecom service of RJio in 2015 entailing investment of Rs 70,000 crore.

The top four telcos' 2015 average operating EBITDA margin will be mostly unchanged at 32-33 percent (2014: 32 per cent) as a decline in data tariffs will offset a gradual rise in voice tariffs,&amp;quot; it said.

This compares to double-digit penetration in other emerging economies such as Brazil (20 percent) and even higher for developed countries such as US and Japan.This has prompted concerns whether Indian subscribers will adopt 4G in any meaningful way. But analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a report that the markets may be overlooking the &amp;amp;ldquo;evolution of the Indian telecom industry towards 4G&amp;amp;rdquo; and the associated financial implications for stocks.The four-point explanation is this.The international perspectiveSouth Korean operators launched 4G in the fourth quarter of 2011 and its 3G net subs additions turned negative starting from second quarter 2012. &amp;amp;ldquo;At the end of first quarter 2013, after five-six quarters of launch, total 4G subs were much ahead of total 3G subs (about 35 percent more than 3G subs). Also, the 4G net additions are consistently higher than decline in 3G subs -- subscribers shifted directly from 2G to 4G skipping 3G,&amp;amp;rdquo; analysts wrote.A similar experience was seen in Japan and China.The behavioural perspectiveIf companies are able to launch 4G serves which deliver superior data experience (say five times faster than 3G) while being priced slightly higher, will it not achieve an attractive price-value equation? Analysts asked, while admitting that ultimately the data experience will also depend on the operator in question.How will 4G succeed when 3G has failed? JPMorgan wrote that the failure of mass adoption in 3G was partially a result on users perceiving that the 3G experience was not a significant improvement in experience over 2G as a result of lack of operator investments in technology and also because early on, 3G handset affordability was a concern (which is now no longer becoming an issue).&amp;amp;ldquo;Channel checks in China suggest that price points for 4G-enabled handsets have come down steeply. Tri-mode handsets are already available at about USD65 (RMB400 or INR4,000), while quad mode and penta-mode (five-mode) devices are available at about USD 160 (RMB1,000 or INR10,000),&amp;amp;rdquo; JPMorgan wrote.Is the market for data big?Finally, analysts suggest that the concern about low data use (on average, the Indian subscriber uses 85 MB data per month on 2G and 350 MB on 3G) may be confusing cause and effect.That is, &amp;amp;ldquo;once better quality data is available at much higher speeds, there is no reason why for example, YouTube user count and usage (interestingly Facebook, for which India has second largest subscriber base, also drives traffic to Youtube through video sharing) cannot increase significantly,&amp;amp;rdquo; they asked.The report does not focus per se on the strategy of to-be-launched Reliance Jio, owned by Reliance Industries, but says the company, which has a pan-India licence to offer 4G services, may &amp;amp;ldquo;provide the trigger/impetus for the non-linear migration&amp;amp;rdquo; from 2G to 4G. Airtel&amp;amp;nbsp;is also another player with large 4G plans.The other viewOthers have their concerns about whether 4G could disrupt the traditional telco business model.&amp;amp;ldquo;India is a voice-centric market, with 85 percent of sector revenue being voice. As a result, a new entrant with no viable low-cost voice strategy may struggle to get subscriber traction as a pure data approach has struggled globally,&amp;amp;rdquo; analysts at HSBC wrote.They pointed to the fact that long-term evolution (LTE) technology can only be used to offer data services, and even in developed markets such as US, the voice-over-LTE technology that 4G operators have rolled out (which involves making voice calls using data, similar to applications such as Skype) is too recent to be judged a success.&amp;amp;ldquo;RJio has the alternative to sign 2G roaming agreements with any of the incumbent operators (such as RCom) for voice services. Though there are no indications of any such agreement currently, we expect RJio&amp;amp;rsquo;s strategy to evolve over time,&amp;amp;rdquo; JPMorgan analysts wrote. &amp;quot;How RJio will provide voice services in the absence of legacy 2G/3G services remains the most critical and &amp;amp;lsquo;make-or-break&amp;amp;rsquo; question.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;ldquo;We think if RJio gets its initial service right at the appropriate price-value equation, it could provide the &amp;amp;lsquo;nudge&amp;amp;rsquo; towards 4G investments in the sector. Thus, we do not see any reason why 4G cannot surpass 3G in terms of subscriber count/revenues within 3 years of its launch,&amp;amp;rdquo; they added.

However, shale gas revenues increased by 2% qoq to &amp;amp;#36;270mn on the back of an increase in sales volume by 10% qoq to 41.4bcfe. Hence, EBIDTA grew by 1% to &amp;amp;#36;201mn qoq. However, realisation came lower from &amp;amp;#36;7/mcfe to &amp;amp;#36;6.58/mcfe. Cumulative investments in shale gas stood at &amp;amp;#36;7.6bn across JVs. Substantial part of Pioneer and Carrizo JV capex met through cash from respective JV operations. While Chevron JV continues to account for substantial part of ongoing capex and funding needs. RIL's decent performance during the quarter has largely been the result of lower depreciation and interest cost. However on margin front, it is too early to expect a sustained recovery in GRM. We maintain our weak/stable outlook on the refining cycle for the near term on the back of a higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. The incremental net refining capacity additions are expected to be 1.7mbpd in the current year as against demand growth of 1mbpd. However, in petchem, it is too early to expect a sustained recovery in demand and margins. In the case of petchem, demand remains a concern. Any weakness in demand could impact a sustained margin recovery. Gas production from the KG basin is expected to increase in the coming quarters from MA field (D26; part of KGD6). However, incremental production from other fields, mainly Rseries, Satellite Field, etc. is expected by 2016, but would be subject to regulatory approval. Although a positive government stance on RIL's E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts in terms of project approvals and gas pricing approval augurs well for the company. We remain cautious about RIL's refining and petchem margins for the near term, due to new capacities and/or weakening demand. However, with the expected improvement in RIL's business profile in the next 2 years, potential upsides from positive developments in E&amp;amp;amp;P and attractive valuations, we maintain an Accumulate rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1046(on FY16 SOTP).

This would mean muted trend in global GRMs. For RIL though, we expect substantial improvement in GRMs leading to widening of its spread when compared with international benchmarks. The key drivers for this growth include 1) commencement of petcoke gasification project in FY17, which would replace expensive RLNG with gas produced from petcoke leading to incremental US&amp;amp;#36;2/bbl GRM (management guidance of US&amp;amp;#36;2.5/bbl), 2) efficient crude sourcing, 3) high complexity at its refineries allowing it to meet the rising demand for cleaner fuels and 4) amongst the lowest operating costs in the world.&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ldquo;In recent times, petrochemical segment performance has been under pressure owing to weak domestic demand environment, rising feedstock prices and surplus capacity situation globally.

It is expanding capacities across products and is also setting up a large off gas cracker. The cost dynamics of this cracker will be similar to gas based plants in Middle East. Resultantly, the margin profile of this plant would be substantially better than RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s existing petrochemical assets.&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ldquo;With flat earnings profile in the past three years, RIL stock has grossly underperformed the broader indices.

Another 10 percent interest was given to Norway's Norsk Hydro (now Statoil Hydro).",,"Business, DGH, KG-D5, NDA, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Petroleo Brasileiro, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/oil-min-frustrated-kg-gas-project-ongc_1167774.html,"As Oil Ministry looks into reasons for delay in ONGC's KG basin gas development, the state-owned firm says it lost three years because the ministry and DGH refused to approve its partnership with Norway's Statoil and Petrobras of Brazil for the block. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had in 2007 farmed out 15 percent stake in the KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block, to Brazil's state-controlled oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA or Petrobras. Another 10 percent interest was given to Norway's Norsk Hydro (now Statoil Hydro). The two firm, who are among the biggest deepsea developers in the world, were to bring in technology and expertise to development of gas discoveries in KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block of ONGC. However, the ministry and its technical arm Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) did not approve the equity participation of the foreign companies, leading to inordinate delays in clearing of drilling programme, ONGC sources said. Frustrated at delays, the two firms finally walked out of the block in 2010. KG-D5 block was originally planned to start producing gas from 2014 with a peak of about 20-25 million standard cubic meters per day. Now, the block will not produce before 2018. After the pullout of Petrobras and Statoil, ONGC, which does not have the technology to produce gas from deepsea in geologically hostile KG basin, tried to rope in other foreign energy majors but its attempts were frustrated as it could not get approvals, sources said. After the new government took over, the Oil Ministry is looking into reasons why ONGC has not started natural gas production from KG-D5, where 11 oil and gas discoveries have been made so far. In contrast, RIL's neighbouring KG-D6 block started gas output in April 2009. Shortly after the pullout by Petrobras and Statoil in 2010, the then ONGC Chairman R S Sharma had shot off an angry letter to the oil secretary saying red tape was making international oil majors apprehensive over sharing exploration risks in acreages where they pick up stake. &amp;quot;This was done by ONGC as a part of its strategy to capitalise on the technological experience of international companies of repute in the development of deepwater discoveries,&amp;quot; Sharma wrote. He stated that although the farm out agreements with Petrobras and Statoil were signed in August/September, 2007, &amp;quot;Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) could not be signed with both these companies, initially, due to 9 months taken in obtaining approval on assignment of participating interest, and then one year in signing amendment to the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) from various parties, including government.&amp;quot; ONGC has made 11 oil and gas discoveries in the Block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5. The block is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). It plans to invest USD 9 billion in producing from discoveries in NDA, sources said. ONGC is looking at producing 2.5-3 million tonnes of oil per annum and 9-10 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the Northern Development Area of KG-D5 block. NDA holds an estimated 92.30 million tonnes of oil reserves and 97.568 billion cubic metres of inplace gas reserves spread over seven fields. Sources said ONGC has submitted to the DGH a Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) for the oil find in the NDA and a detailed field development plan will be submitted by year-end. ONGC bought 90 percent interest in Block KG-D5 from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn still holds 10 percent in the block. Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area - Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna). Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries - E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1 and KT-1 in NDA and the first ultra-deepwater discovery UD-1 at a record depth of 2,841 metres. The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U, A, while the ultra deepsea UD find lies in SDA. ONGC, sources said, is looking at producing oil and gas from NDA using a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit. An investment plan for UD-1 will be submitted separately, they added."

Imported Ethane will substitute its current propane imports and a portion of naphtha used for ethylene production. &amp;quot;Given depressed US ethane prices and rising production, we estimate an annual saving of USD 450 million from this feedstock substitution from FY18,&amp;quot; CLSA said in a research report. Reliance recently announced its plans to import 1.5 million tons per annum of ethane from North America which will be used as a feedstock in its existing crackers in India. The company has executed storage and capacity agreements for liquefaction of ethane with a North American terminal and has also ordered six VLECs (Very Large Ethane Carriers) for transporting ethane to India.  Imports could start from end-2016. CLSA said: &amp;quot;While propane is a globally traded commodity, trade of ethane is a relatively new trend as it needs very low temperatures (minus 89 degrees Celsius) to be maintained.&amp;quot; Reliance's current ethylene capacity stands at about 1.9 million tons per annum. Of this, 0.8 million ton (40 percent) is gas (C2-C3) based while the remaining uses naphtha as a feedstock. &amp;quot;As per our estimate, domestic natural gas makes up about 35 percent of current feedstock for its gas based capacity with imported Propane accounting for the rest,&amp;quot; CLSA said. Reliance is also likely to convert a large portion of its 0.9 million tons naphtha based Hazira cracker into dual feed to enable acceptance of imported ethane as a feedstock. &amp;quot;Given current US ethane price of about USD 3, we estimate landed ethane price of USD 9 per million British thermal unit. Using current imported propane and naphtha price of USD 17 and 20 per mmBtu respectively, this arbitrage will reduce RIL's FY18 blended feedstock cost significantly. We estimate annual savings from FY18 of USD 450 million (USD 240 per ton) i.e. 8 percent of FY14 Ebitda,&amp;quot; CLSA said. This implies an attractive 3.3 years payback to USD 1.5 billion estimated investment on the project. The cracker will be commissioned in the second half of 2016. It will nearly double its ethylene production capacity to 3.3 million tons a year. The company has ordered six very large ethane carriers from South Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries for USD 723 million. The vessels of 87,000 cubic meters each, will be the world's first very large carriers of ethane. Disclosure: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is now part of the Reliance Group."

We also have a decent exposure to outsourcing stocks.&amp;amp;rdquo; the report said.Kotak expects the market to be range-bound until the government announces the next set of reforms and/or the RBI adopts a looser monetary policy.&amp;amp;ldquo;The Indian market is reasonably valued and we see limited scope for earnings upgrades over the next six-nine months.&amp;amp;rdquo;Economic reforms were India&amp;amp;rsquo;s only hope for higher GDP growth in the medium term due to the lack of options available in fiscal and monetary policies, according to Kotak.&amp;amp;ldquo;Thus, we wait for more reforms but retain faith in the currency government&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability and willingness to deliver progressive economic policies over the next few quarters.&amp;amp;rdquo;"

This is primarily on the back of Infrastructure Management Services growing substantially higher than the company's average growth rate. The Management noted that growth in revenue from software services will pick up when the respective component in the large deals won recently ramps up. We believe that sustaining the run-rate of large deal wins is a healthy sign and should translate into better revenue visibility for the company in FY2015. We expect HCL Tech to post a USD and INR revenue CAGR of 12.7 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively, over FY2014&amp;amp;ndash;16E and remain watchful of the company's performance in the core software services. On the operating front, we remain skeptic on the company's ability to sustain operating margins at current levels with it going for hiring (with increase in demand) and wage hikes going ahead as attrition continues to remain sticky. We value the company at 14.5x FY2016E EPS and give it a target price of Rs 1,560. We recommend an Accumulate rating on the stock.&amp;quot; Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;(RIL) &amp;quot;For 4QFY2014, RIL's Petrochemicals and Refining segments' profit reported improvement; however, its Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment's profitability continued to decline on a yoy basis due to decline in production from its KG D6 block. Looking ahead, we expect production from the KG D6 block to increase gradually from FY2015. Moreover, higher gas prices and the recent improvement in GRMs are likely to drive earnings growth in FY2015-16. Hence, we recommend an Accumulate rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,042&amp;quot;, says Angel Broking research report.

RIL had found gas in the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 wells in October 2002 and were declared commercially viable finds between April 2003 and March 2004. It in May 2004 claimed the finds to hold 8.3 trillion cubic feet of inplace gas reserves, the CAG said in a draft audit report of KG-D6 block. Also Read: Reliance to shut refining units for maintenance in March The DGH approved a USD 2.47 billion initial development plan for the two finds by lowering the inplace reserves to 5.45 Tcf and recoverable resource to 3.81 Tcf with first gas coming in August 2006. However, before the start of commercial production, RIL in October 2006 submitted changes in the development plan by raising the capex requirement to USD 8.8 billion in two phases and putting recoverable reserves at 12.04 Tcf out of inplace volumes of 14.164 Tcf. A management committee, comprising representatives of DGH, oil ministry and the operator, in December 2006 approved the revised plan putting recoverable reserves at 10.03 Tcf and doubling of output to 80 million standard cubic metres a day. However the fields, which began production in April 2009, did not behave as predicted and output slumped within a year, forcing RIL and its new partner BP to restate the reserves at 2.9 Tcf. The CAG in the report said the production sharing contract stipulates that a contractor should submit an appraisal programme to reassess the extent of the discoveries. &amp;quot;There was no appraisal programme in respect of D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas discoveries as required under PSC. The operator moved directly from discovery to commercial discovery. &amp;quot;Appraisal programme would have enabled the operator to delineate the petroleum reservoirs to which the discovery related in terms of thickness and lateral extent besides determining the characteristics thereof and quality of recoverable petroleum therein,&amp;quot; it said in the report. The CAG said it was not clear how DGH had assured itself of the reliability of the development plan, as well as the estimates of reserves, production rates and costs in absence of the appraisal programme. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 output has fallen to about one-tenth of the 80 mmscmd production that RIL had estimated for this time. &amp;quot;It is not clear how DGH had ensured accuracy and realistic nature of the data before agreeing to the approval of Addendum to the Initial Development Plan (AIDP),&amp;quot; the auditor said. The CAG has sought comments of the Oil Ministry on its draft report before finalising a Performance Audit report."

While India is surplus in petroleum products, production of LPG in the country is lower than the demand. The deficit is met through imports which have to increased if any of 20 refiners in the country produces less than projected LPG. Sources said modern refineries have flexibility of changing product slate and often LPG production is pushed down in favour of high value petrol and diesel. Change in production profiles of refineries especially private sector units, has in the past led to LPG scarcity and the resultant delays in delivery of domestic cooking gas. To tide over this, the Oil Ministry last month sought law ministry's opinion if the government can under the Essential Commodities Act of 1955 ask both public and private sector oil refineries to produce a certain volumes. Sources said the Law Ministry in its opinion has stated that petroleum and petroleum products are among the essential commodities defined under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Section 3(1) of the Act empowerd the Union government to provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution of essential commodity and trade for maintaining or increasing supply of any essential&amp;amp;nbsp; ommodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability. Also read: ATF price hiked by 1%, non-subsidised LPG rate cut by Rs 53 The government, the law ministry opinion said, can issue an order for LPG under Section 3(1). &amp;quot;In view of the above provision of the Act it appears that the Central government may by an order under the (Essential Commodities) Act mandate a minimum percentage of LPG production from all the refineries,&amp;quot; it said. Against a projected demand of 16.5 million tonnes, indigenous availabilty of LPG is only 10.4 million tonnes during the current fiscal. The remaining 6.5 million tonnes is being met through imports. Sources said while petrol production by refineries has risen by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9 percent in five years beginning 2007-08, CAGR in LPG production was only 1.5 percent. Diesel too has shown a CAGR of 7.2 percent. Government has drawn an ambitious target of increasing LPG penetration in the country to 75 percent of the population by releasing 5.5 crore new connections by 2015. Focus of Vision 2015 is to extend the usage of LPG for cooking purposes in rural/under- served areas so that standard of life in rural areas improves by switching from kerosene or firewood to environmental friendly fuel, they said. To achieve this, domestic production has to increase, they added. Presently, 16.24 crore domestic LPG connections cover about 62 percent of the population."

Sources said the technicalities of submission of bank guarantee had been used by the Oil Ministry in not announcing the new price that will be applicable from April 1. On January 10 the ministry had notified that all domestically produced natural gas will be priced at an average of international hub rates and price at which India imports gas in its liquid form (LNG).

Mukesh Ambani-led RIL had sought the reversal of 1,383.68 acres - from Reliance Haryana SEZ Ltd (RHSL) to the Haryana State Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) - saying that the project had become unviable. An official release said the SEZ Project at Gurgaon had &amp;quot;been rendered economically unviable due to the mid-term corrections in the SEZ Policy viz. imposition of the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), withdrawal of the Tax holiday, slowdown in the global economy, prohibitively high prices of land and other problems associated with aggregation of land through private negotiations&amp;quot;. Sensing the difficulties posed in this behalf, the Chief Minister had requested Reliance to return the HSIIDC land, it said. &amp;quot;As such, RHSL offered to return the HSIIDC land and abandon the SEZ project in Gurgaon vide their letter of January 2012,&amp;quot; the release said. &amp;quot;RHSL had requested for refund of the amount paid by them to the HSIIDC and re-imbursement of expenditure incurred on the site, apart from interest on the said amount aggregating to Rs. 1,172 crore,&amp;quot; it added. The proposal was considered at the level of the Haryana Investment Promotion Board, headed by the Chief Minister, after examining all the legal aspects of the Joint Venture Agreement, it said, adding that HIPB recommended acceptance of the return offer strictly in accordance with the provisions of the JV agreement. &amp;quot;Accordingly, the Haryana Cabinet&amp;amp;nbsp;Saturday approved the return of the land to HSIIDC, in lieu of payment of an amount of Rs. 343.51 crore to RHSL as against Rs. 399.85 crore paid by RHSL at the time of transfer of land and the demand of Rs. 1,172 crore by RHSL,&amp;quot; the order noted. &amp;quot;The claims on account of Administrative charges forming price of the subject, refund of the Stamp Duty, re-imbursement of development expenditure and interest amount have not been accepted. The refund amount has been worked out strictly as per the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement date 19th June 2006 signed between the HSIIDC and RVL.&amp;quot; HSIIDC and Reliance Ventures Ltd, wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, had entered into a JV Agreement on June 19, 2006 for setting up of the SEZ over an area of 25,000 acres in Gurgaon and Jhajjar districts. HSIIDC had transferred about 1,383.68 acres at Village Garhi Harsaru to the special purpose vehicle floated by HSIIDC and RVL for implementing the project - Reliance Haryana SEZ Ltd, for about Rs.399.85 crore. The project configuration was subsequently changed to SEZ in Gurgaon district over 12,500 acres and a Model Economic Township over 12,500 acres in Jhajjar district. Reliance was able to purchase, and aggregate, about 7,100 acres in Jhajjar, and another about 1200 acres in Gurgaon, but it was not contiguous. RHSL also paid Annuity to the landowners whose land was acquired/procured in Gurgaon &amp;amp;amp; Jhajjar amounting to Rs. 50.71 crore up to March 31, 2013. It included Rs. 17.61 crore on HSIIDC land in Gurgaon and balance amount of about Rs. 33.10 crore in Jhajjar where they had procured land through direct negotiations. Soon after the Haryana government received the land return offer from RHSL, it has been engaged in discussions with the Union Ministry of Commerce &amp;amp;amp; Industry for the best utilisation of the subject land, the release said. &amp;quot;It has been agreed with the Ministry of Commerce &amp;amp;amp; Industry to use the subject land for establishment of a state of the art Global City Project as a send investment node under the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) Project,&amp;quot; it further said. &amp;quot;The Global City is envisaged to be developed as a high value added manufacturing infused area which, apart from adding to the economic development, would also help in generating skilled employment in Haryana.&amp;quot; Mr Hooda said the land acquired for the Reliance project would not be returned to the original owners of the land. The new project is envisaged to be an integrated model township in Gurgaon, comprising of the exhibition and convention centre, high value innovation and knowledge industries, central business district and township facilities.

This makes Sinha only the second Sebi chief after DR Mehta to be heading the regulatory body over three years. Sinha took over the Sebi reins in February 2011, succeeding CB Bhave. Before being appointed the boss, he was the Chairman and Managing Director of UTI Mutual Fund. Credited with an effort, sometimes acting tough, to bring more transparency to stock markets, we take a look back at this career bureaucrat&amp;amp;rsquo;s tenure as the Sebi chief. *After taking his office, Sinha introduced rules to improve corporate governance and disclosure standards. *Under his regime, Sinha unveiled reforms like change in policies for mutual funds (MFs) and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) * Sebi became tough on new fund launches. The regulator said it would not allow asset managers to launch funds if their existing portfolio includes a fund with same or similar strategy. At a public event Sinha had said that Sebi does not want &amp;amp;ldquo;new funds unless they have a separate (different) style of investment&amp;amp;rdquo;. *During his tenure, Sebi also came up with new rules aimed at curbing improper selling by distributors. *In 2009, Sebi had banned fund houses from charging entry load from new investors and had put curbs on the exit load. This hit the asset management industry. However, Sinha allowed MFs to charge additional fees from existing investors. *In order to attract more foreign investors and fund flow, Sebi unified the investment route by FIIs and qualified foreign investors by unveiling a uniform entry norm. *Under Sinha, Sebi asked for special powers for investigations and enforcement by the government. The finance ministry has sought law ministry&amp;amp;rsquo;s opinion regarding re-promulgation of the Sebi ordinance. The ordinance authorises Sebi chairman to investigate, conduct search and seizure under the Sebi Act and crack down on Ponzi schemes. *Sinha found himself entangled in controversy. In 2011, Former Sebi board member KM Abraham had alleged that the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, his officer of special duty (OSD) Omita Paul and Sebi chief UK Sinha had pressured Abraham to go easy against some corporate interests, including the Sahara Group, Reliance, and MCX. However, the finance ministry rejected Abraham&amp;amp;rsquo;s allegations claiming it to be &amp;amp;ldquo;defamatory, devoid of any truth and are a complete distortion of facts&amp;amp;rdquo;. *Currently Sebi is fighting some high profile legal cases like &amp;amp;ndash; Subrata Roy (Sahara case),&amp;amp;nbsp;Reliance Industries (Mukesh Ambani),&amp;amp;nbsp;Financial Technologies (Jignesh Shah) &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Fuel retailing in India is permitted to companies who have invested Rs 2,000 crore in oil and gas infrastructure in the country.&amp;quot;They are entitled to it (retailing license) and they will get this entitlement,&amp;quot; Rae said. A BP spokesperson confirmed BP's intent to enter into the aviation business through the company's subsidiary, Air BP. &amp;quot;Air BP, our global aviation services division continues to grow in new locations. As part of this growth, we plan to expand our footprint into material emerging markets in the world, including India. With that long term intent, we would like to secure a license to market ATF in India,&amp;quot; the spokesperson added.BP, the spokesperson said, was not interested in auto fuel retailing (setting up petrol pumps) in the country. &amp;quot;BP's potential entry in retail fuel marketing is entirely speculative. We have no such plans at the moment.&amp;quot;Rae said ATF sale is a deregulated sector and any company which is able to tie-up logistics can enter the sector. While jet fuel bunkering at most of the airports in the country are owned and controlled by state-owned firms, the refueling infrastructure at new airports being built by private firms is bid out and allows third party access to the infrastructure. &amp;quot;BP can either buy ATF from local refineries like Reliance Industries or can import. That is not an issue,&amp;quot; Rae said.The third party access to the storage and refueling infrastructure at the airports would allow BP access but the challenge would be to arrange for logistics to carry the fuel from refinery or port of import to the airport because unlike state-owned firms, BP does not own pipelines to transport it.India had in 2002 allowed private companies entry into fuel retailing subject to the minimum investment criteria. Reliance Industries,&amp;amp;nbsp;Essar Oil and Royal Dutch Shell got licenses and opened petrol pumps. However, RIL shut pumps and other companies went slow on expansion as government gave huge subsidised to state-owned firms, practically making it impossible for private companies to compete. BP in 2011 agreed to acquire a 30 percent stake in blocks operated by Reliance Industries for &amp;amp;#36;7 billion. The UK-based energy firm has also formed a 50:50 joint venture with Reliance for sourcing and marketing gas."

However in petchem, it is too early to expect a sustained recovery in petchem margins. In the case of petchem, demand remains a concern. Any weakness in demand could impact a sustained margin recovery. We maintain our weak outlook on the refining cycle for the near term on the back of a higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. The incremental net refining capacity additions are expected to be 1.7mbpd in the current year as against demand growth of 1mbpd. Gas production from the KG basin is expected to increase in the coming quarters from MA field (D26; part of KGD6). However, incremental production from other fields, mainly Rseries, Satellite Field, etc. is expected by 2015-16, but would be subject to approval of terms and conditions of the bank guarantee.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Although a positive government stance on RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts in terms of project approvals and gas pricing approval augurs well for the company. We remain cautious about RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s refining and petchem margins for the near term, due to new capacities and/or weakening demand. However, with the expected improvement in RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s business profile in the next 2 years, potential upsides from positive developments in E&amp;amp;amp;P and attractive valuations, we maintain an Accumulate rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 982.

Wipro remains confident of improving revenue growth trajectory ahead driven by a better demand environment, a healthy deal pipeline across multiple verticals as well as Infra Services (hitherto an area of strength, however company was lagging peers on growth here through the past 2 years).&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We tweak our FY15/16E earnings higher by 4/7 percent higher to Rs 38/41 respectively driven largely by higher revenue/margin assumptions (refer table below). Valuations remain attractive given improving operating performance (read revenue growth trajectory). We raise TP to Rs 615 (V/s Rs 550 earlier), based on 15x FY16E earnings. Wipro remains our 2nd most preferred bet in the Tier I space after Infosys. Accumulate the stock.&amp;quot; HDFC Bank &amp;quot;HDFC Bank, we are quite cognizant of the fact that the growth in the operating revenues for HDFCB has decelerated materially, 16 percent yoy for M9FY14 vs. 18-25 percent in FY12-13. However, the core operating profit has grown by 24 percent for M9FY14 vs. 15-22 percent in FY12-13. And hence, we aren&amp;amp;rsquo;t unduly worried about few basis points drop in NIMs as notwithstanding the same, the RoAs have remain superior at 1.8-1.9 percent (in fact topped at 2.1 percent for Q3FY14).&amp;quot; &amp;quot;HDFC Bank commands valuation premium over its peers owing to its a) ability towards healthy loan growth and across all segment ie retail and corporate b) NIM at 4 percent+ levels c) stable asset quality with healthy PCR and d) adequate capital for growth with superior return ratios.

The quarterly net revenues stood at Rs 1.03 lakh crore, up 10 percent year-on-year.&amp;amp;nbsp;Brokerage house Antique has maintained a &amp;amp;lsquo;hold&amp;amp;rsquo; on Reliance Industries but revised its target price higher. &amp;amp;ldquo;We slightly revise our SOTP-based target price up from Rs 940 to Rs 950 assuming a weaker rupee.

He was scheduled to participate in a session on 'Eurasia: The Next Frontier?' at WEF, and was also expected to hold a number of private meetings on the sidelines. These meetings would have been significant as it was to be Sharif's first outing to such a large global business summit ever since he won an historic election in Pakistan last year.

However, both of them are expected to be separately attending a number of private meetings with businessmen and political leaders from across the world, which assume significance in the wake of overseas revenues accounting for a bulk of the respective top-lines of their groups. The two top Indian industrialists are expected to come face to face also at a number of dinners and receptions hosted on the sidelines of WEF summit, including one hosted by Mistry himself on behalf of his group's IT arm TCS and an India Reception by industry body CII.&amp;amp;nbsp; While nearly 40 heads of state and more than 1500 global CEOs are scheduled to be present, some big names are absent from the final list. These include chiefs of technology giants like Microsoft (although founder Bill Gates is present), Google, Facebook and Apple, but Yahoo's young CEO Marissa Mayer is one of the co-chairs alongwith Infosys' Kris Gopalakrishnan. Vodafone chief is also not here, although heads of PepsiCo, Coca Cola, Wal-Mart and ArcelorMittal are expected to be here. Once a regular, Citibank's former CEO Vikram Pandit is also missing, while his successor and incumbent chief of global banking giant Mike Corbat has also given this summit a miss. As yet, more than 100 business leaders from India are expected to be present, along with five union ministers -- P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma, Kamal Nath, Praful Patel and Jyotiraditya Scindia -- and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

With Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily approving of the remedial measures that were pending for nearly 18 months, RIL-BP last week added the first production well on the block in more than four years to ramp up output by over 15% to 13.7 million standard cubic metres per day. Also Read:&amp;amp;nbsp;RIL, BP to give &amp;amp;#36;1.2 bn bank guarantee for higher gas price This well, which will add up to two mmmscmd to the output, as well as water pluggings adding smaller volumes, could have come a year back and averted complete stoppage of gas supplies to power plants. BP India head Sashi Mukundan said the two partners are currently attempting to cut off water ingress into three wells on the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields and if successful will do the same on a similar number of wells in 2015. In between, they will also install a compressor at the onshore terminal to pull the gas up from the wells that are over a kilometre below the sea. On MA field, also in KG-D6 block, RIL-BP added the MA-8 well on January 2 and plan to do drill a branch well (called side tracking) later this year by re-entering a shut well. He said, &amp;quot;this is part of the next phase of producing the gas in the MA field after the oil has been produced&amp;quot;. A similar side-track well is planned on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 in 2015 and another one may be looked at on MA in 2015 if the results of the one planned this year is successful, he said. &amp;quot;We are currently doing water shut-off (WSO) job on three wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields before we install a compressor in first half of 2015,&amp;quot; he said. The KG-D6 fields had scaled to become India's largest producing gas fields in March 2010 but in less than a year it witnessed unanticipated water and sand ingress shutting down well after well. BP, which bought 30% stake in KG-D6 and 20 other blocks of RIL for USD 7.2 billion, flew in a number of experts from its worldwide operations and on its part RIL experts engaged at BP's deep water technical facilities in Sunbury, UK and in Houston, Texas to look for remedies. The situation demanded immediate interventions like re-entry into the water flooded wells to plug seepage and install compressor that could pump out the gas. However, approvals for the remedial actions which otherwise should have come as part of routine annual budgets, were blocks by both the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons and the Oil Ministry over a dispute about CAG auditing RIL accounts. This resulted in the shut-in of more wells. With 10 out of the 18 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 shutting down and a third of the six on MA closed due to water and sand ingress, there appeared on the horizon a situation where systems would shutdown if just a tenth of the gas flowed in a design capacity of 80 mmscmd. &amp;quot;RIL as operator with the support of BP experts have worked very hard to avert a shutdown,&amp;quot; he said."

The well has potential to produce 1 million to 2 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas from the well and the output is expected to stabilise by the middle of the month, the Reliance official said. Reliance is currently producing about 10 mscmd gas from the KG D6 block, sharply lower from the 60 mscmd production at the end of 2010. Reliance and partner BP have cited geological complexities for the fall in output but the oil regulator believes they have failed to drill enough wells. Falling output had already prompted the government to disallow proportionate cost recovery to Reliance, leading to arbitration proceedings over the issue. Last month, India allowed Reliance to charge higher prices for gas from April only after the company offered financial guarantees to the government to settle any claims against it over a shortfall in its gas output."

The SAT concluded the hearing on the matter under which RIL challenged Sebi's decision to take the case out of the consent mechanism process saying the amount involved is too large. Also read: Insider trading laws difficult, India no exception: Expert Senior RIL counsel Janak Dwarkadas requested Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) to ask the Sebi to fix a time-table for hearing the consent application once again. The consent mechanism allows companies and individuals to settle their disputes with the Sebi by paying a sum without admission or denial of the alleged wrongdoing, but disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. The matter dates back to 2007, when RIL, prior to the merger of Reliance Petroleum with itself, allegedly short-sold 4.1 per cent stake in RPL valued at Rs 4,023 crore to prevent a slump in the stock. The RPL shares were sold first in the futures market and later in the spot market, covering the share sales in the futures market, it was alleged. In 2008, Sebi initiated a probe into the matter and in 2010 initiated quasi-judicial proceedings and said it had found that RIL had booked a profit of Rs 513 crore in the futures segment through this deal worth Rs 4,023 crore. The Sebi argued that the company was aware of the sale of shares and sold futures ahead of that, therefore amounting to insider-trading and sent a show-cause notice to the company. RIL had challenged the Sebi show-cause notice in December 2010. Following this, Sebi ordered a probe and found that RIL had violated insider-trading norms. Though RIL moved Sebi for consent settlement, the regulator did not entertain the application, forcing RIL to move the SAT. Arguing RIL's case, Dwarkadas today asked, &amp;quot;What is the difficulty if Sebi now fixes a meeting of the internal committee and decides on the consent application, now that the inspection of documents is finally over.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sebi can reject our application, but at least they should hear us out,&amp;quot; Dwarkadas argued. He also claimed that Sebi was wrong in saying that RIL's application could not be dealt with under the new consent mechanism, saying the company was clearly told on April 15, 2011 that it could apply for a settlement via consent. In response to the RIL charges and demand, senior Sebi counsel Darius Khambata said, &amp;quot;Sebi cannot be compelled to settle a case through consent as the consent norms are administrative guidelines and cannot be challenged in court.&amp;quot; To substantiate his argument, Khambata cited a Bombay High Court order in favour of Sebi in a similar case involving Shilpa Stock Brokers. Khambata also said the consent norms do not give an entity the right to ask Sebi to take up its case for settlement. &amp;quot;It's absolutely Sebi's discretion to take a call and it can refuse to settle a case under consent anytime in public interest,&amp;quot; Khambata said. In May 2012, Sebi tightened the norms for settlement through the consent framework. As a result, many cases, including those related to insider trading, are not being settled through this mechanism."

RIL and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources have spud the seventh well on the MA oil and gas field in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin. The well, MA-8, is likely to be put on production this month, sources with direct knowledge of the development said. MA-8 is projected to produce a minimum of 1 mmscmd and a maximum of 3 mmscmd, they said. Also read: Reliance likely to surge in 2014; cautious on retail: HDFC At 3 mmscmd, MA-8 will be RIL's biggest gas producer well on KG-D6 currently. Production at KG-D6 has dropped to just about 12 mmscmd and MA-8 will help reverse the falling trend of last three years. The current output is made up of about 8.5 mmscmd from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas field and about 3.3 mmscmd from the MA field in the same block. Sources said RIL is also repairing a third of the wells shut at its main D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas field to boost output by March. RIL had to shut 10 out of the 18 producing wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 due to sand and water flooding. It had also shut two of the six wells at the MA field due to high water and sand ingress. MA-8 will be the seventh well on the field. The KG-D6 fields, which began gas production in April 2009, hit a peak output of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down well after well. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, produced 66.35 mmscmd, while 3.07 mmscmd was the output from the MA field, the only oil discovery on the block. Besides the fall in output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, gas production from the MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, has dropped. Of the current gas production from KG-D6, 11.7 mmscmd was sold to urea manufacturing fertiliser plants and the remaining consumed by the pipeline that transports the KG-D6 gas, sources said. The company has so far made 18 gas and one oil discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin block in Bay of Bengal. While the lone oil find, MA went on stream in September 2008, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 were put on production in April 2009."

At current rate of production of about 8 million standard cubic meters per day, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 will produce about 0.3 Tcf in the next three years - the time that may be needed to settle the issue of gas hoarding charges.The bank guarantee for 0.3 Tcf comes to USD 1.2 billion, they said. Of this, the share of RIL, which holds 60 per cent stake in KG-D6, will come to USD 60 million per quarter. BP has 30 per cent interest and the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko.D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the first of the 19 discoveries in eastern offshore KG-D6 block that was put on production in April 2009, originally was estimated to hold 10.03 Tcf of reserves. But these were last year slashed to 2.9 Tcf based on production data for first three years when wells were shut one after another following water and sand sweeping inside along with sharp drop in reservoir pressure.Of the re-stated reserves of 2.9 Tcf, about 2.2 Tcf have already been produced in first four-and-half-years and balance of about 0.75 Tcf remains to be produced.Sources said the new rate will apply to all other fields in KG-D6 without any preconditions. The currently producing MA oil and gas as well as fields like R-Series and satellite discoveries that will come into production in 2016-17 will also get the new rates without any preconditions.The government, sources said, has already imposed a penalty of USD 1.78 billion on RIL and its partners for producing less-than-stated production targets during last three years. The bank guarantee is an addition to this.While RIL blames unseen geological complexities for production not matching the pre-stated targets for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the Petroleum Ministry and its technical arm DGH hold the company for not drilling the committed number of wells, resulting in output fall.With both sides not budging from their positions, the issue has been referred to arbitration which may take anywhere between 2 to 3 years to arrive at final verdict.Prodded by the Finance ministry, the Oil ministry had initially proposed to deny the new gas prices that will kick in from next fiscal till such time that RIL either made up for the shortfall in output during past three fiscals, or it is proved that the company was not responsible for production falling below targets.The issue had held up notification of the new gas pricing formula that will be applicable to all producers - public and private - and all forms of gas - conventional and unconventional forms like coal-bed methane and shale gas.As a way out, it was proposed that RIL and its partners BP and Niko be asked to give bank guarantees for the incremental revenue they will get till the hoarding issue is resolved through arbitration and validation by independent international experts.The government in June approved the Rangarajan formula for pricing of all domestically produced natural gas at an average of global gas hub rates and price at which India imports LNG (gas in liquid form).The rate in April 2014, when the new pricing is to be implemented, will be about USD 8.2 to 8.4 as against the current USD 4.2.Prices of natural gas, which is an input for manufacturing fertiliser and electricity generation, will be revised every quarter based on the average of the past four quarters, with a gap of one quarter."

An intra-court appeal against the order is pending before a larger bench.However, the year was tough for Sahara India Parivar as Roy was not only restrained from leaving India but he and his group firms were accused of taking the apex court &amp;quot;for ride&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;playing hide and seek&amp;quot; in the case relating to refund of Rs 20,000 crore to investors in which they are facing contempt proceedings.More trouble came when the apex court said that contempt proceedings can go ahead against Roy and his two employees for interfering with the investigation into the 2G spectrum case.The 2G spectrum scam also forced&amp;amp;nbsp;Bharti Cellular CMD Sunil Mittal, Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia and&amp;amp;nbsp;Reliance ADAG chief Anil Ambani to rush to the apex court in the wake of special CBI court issuing them summonses to appear as accused and witnesses respectively.While Mittal and Ruia got a temporary relief from the apex court which stayed the proceedings against them in additional spectrum scam in which they have been summoned as an accused, Ambani failed to convince the court to give an order against the trial court directing him to appear as a witness in the 2G case involving former Telecom Minister A Raja and others, including three top executives of his group.A day after ADAG chief's testimony, his wife Tina Ambani also made her appearance in the Patiala house court and recorded her statement which was described as &amp;quot;better than her husband&amp;quot; in answering questions by special judge O P Saini.Government's controversial decision to hike the price of natural gas reached the Supreme Court which agreed to examine the issue raised by CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta who filed a PIL accusing Petroleum Minister M Veerappa Moily of allegedly favouring Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which have been refuted by them.If 2012 was the year of 2G scam, then 2013 would be recorded in the history of the apex court for coalgate case and CBI's clamour to attain autonomy and free itself from its political masters to investigate top bureaucrats.The high voltage hearing in the coal scam saw the apex court taking strong exception to the interference into its probe by the then Law Minister Ashwani Kumar, who was forced to resign.CBI, which was termed as &amp;quot;caged parrot&amp;quot; by the apex court during the hearing in the coal scam, came out all guns blazing and named corporate bigwigs Naveen Jindal and Kumar Mangalam Birla in separate FIRs registered in connection with the case.The controversy surrounding former corporate lobbyist Niira Radia's tapped conversations was dealt by the apex court and after long hearing, it directed CBI to probe some key issues in which names of some big corporates, politicians, bureaucrats and journalists cropped up. Nokia, which, as per the Income Tax department, owes it Rs 21,153 crore as total tax liability (existing and anticipated), including penalty during a seven-year period from 2006-2013, had moved the court with its plea for lifting of stay on sale of the assets.The controversy surrounding the AirAsia deal reached the Delhi High Court after the apex court asked BJP leader Subramanian Swamy to approach the high court.The high court sought responses from Civil Aviation Ministry and DGCA on the plea which has sought a direction against grant of further approvals on the ground that the deal was contrary to the applicable FDI policy and DGCA guidelines.During the year, the functioning of UK-based multinational accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Pvt Ltd and its network audit firms in India came under judicial scrutiny with the apex court agreeing to hear a petition for a probe against them for allegedly indulging in financial irregularities and fudging of accounts.The court issued notice to Centre, RBI, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), PwC and the audit firms sharing its brand name saying the issues raised in the petition need &amp;quot;examination&amp;quot;.In the issue of arbitration proceedings of dispute between Antrix Corporation, the commercial arm of ISRO, and Devas Multimedia regarding scrapping of 1,000 crore deal for scarce S-band spectrum, the apex court held that it can take place at International Court of Arbitration in London.The court had dismissed Antrix's plea which had contended that according to their agreement and tender conditions, the place of arbitration was Bangalore and sought seeking its direction for conducting arbitration proceeding in India."

The Minister said the option before the country was to either keep the finds in the ground and continue importing gas at USD 12-13 or pay much lesser than this price to domestic producers to bring the discoveries to production and cut foreign exchange outgo on imports. &amp;quot;We may end up importing 100 percent (of our needs) if we don't encourage exploration,&amp;quot; Moily said. The reserves in the discoveries not viable at current price equals the remaining resources in the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields in RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 block. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on June 27 approved pricing of domestically produced gas at an average of imported LNG and international benchmarks from April 1 2014. Accordingly, the price in April would be about USD 8.4. While the decision was to apply to all public and private producers of conventional gas and non-conventional fuel like coal-bed methane and shale gas, the decision was not notified as the Finance Ministry felt RIL should not get the benefit because it has in past three years produced less than targets. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs yesterday allowed RIL the new rates provided it gave a bank guarantee to cover its liability if gas-hoarding charges are proved. The bank guarantee, which will be equivalent to the incremental revenue that RIL will get from the new gas price, will be encashed if it is proved that the company hoarded gas or deliberately suppressed production at the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields in KG-D6 block since 2010-11."

However, a distinction has now been made in the gas produced from fields given to ONGC on nomination basis. Any gas that came into production after 2010 is being treated differently than APM gas for which the government decides the price as well as marketing margin. Gas from the fields of ONGC that came into production after 2010 are being termed as non-APM gas and GAIL has been since November billing higher marketing margin of Rs 10.21 per mmBtu on such fuel sold to consumers, sources said. Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers&amp;amp;nbsp;Ltd (RCF) and&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are among the consumers who have got two bills for November quoting the higher marketing margin. While RCF refused to pay the higher charges, RIL paid the first bill in protest but when the second bill came it deducted the higher charges it had paid earlier, they said. Non-APM gas coming from the nomination fields of ONGC is distributed to consumers by GAIL although a small volume is directly sold to consumers by ONGC itself. Also read: Essar Energy reiterates outlook, shares rise While ONGC has not changed the marketing margin on the volumes it trades directly to consumers, GAIL has been since November billing consumers a higher marketing margin. GAIL, sources said, has reasoned that the higher marketing margin is at par with the rate it charges for its effort on sale of gas from western offshore fields of Panna/Mukta and Tapti. At the time of revising APM gas price to USD 4.2 per mmBtu in May 2010 (effective from June 1, 2010), the Oil Ministry had directed that marketing margin of Rs 200 per thousand cubic metres would be charged from customers by the company marketing the gas produced by national oil companies (ONGC and Oil India Ltd). Subsequently, in June 2010, the Ministry again clarified that marketing margin shall be charged by ONGC and OIL in cases where they are directly selling gas to end customers and in other cases, the marketing margin would be charged by the companies marketing the gas ie GAIL. The Ministry had last month ordered that allows marketers freedom to fix marketing margin on sale of gas to consumers other than urea manufacturing units and LPG plants. Oil regulator PNGRB will decide marketing margin for urea and LPG plants."

The excess area being taken away holds five discoveries -- D-4, D-7, D-8, D-16 and D-23 -- with 0.805 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, or about one-fourth of the restated reserves in the producing Dhirubhai 1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields in the KG-D6 block, and is worth USD 10 billion.

The five discoveries, he wrote, are non-associated natural gas find, which under the Production Sharing Contract, the company was entitled to retain as a discovery area. Stating that all timelines prescribed in the PSC were followed, he said RIL submitted the proposal to declare the finds commercial within the stipulated three years and a FDP for the five finds along with four others on July 14, 2008, within the prescribed one year. RIL said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) communicated that the discoveries are unviable at the current price of USD 4.2 only on March 31, 2009, as against the PSC stipulated timeline of deciding the issue within 180 days from the submission and 90 days from receipt of additional information. &amp;quot;The DGH evaluation using a gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units ignored the fact that the gas price of USD 4.2 was valid only until March 31, 2014, and that the competitive arm's length or market price for gas might increase,&amp;quot; Ganguly said. Following the DGH advice, RIL submitted an optimised field development plan on December 19, 2009, for the big four out of the nine discoveries and left the rest for being tied up at a later date. RIL said the original FDP of July 2008 for the five finds was still valid and had not been withdrawn and the DGH assertion that no development plan was submitted for D-4, D-7, D-8, D-16 and D-23 was not true.

The Ministry, which has been for past two years grappling with the issue of marketing margin charged by gas producers and sellers like Reliance Industries and GAIL India, last month ordered that the margin to be charged over and above the gas sale price be fixed between seller and buyers in sectors other than urea and LPG.  Official sources said the Ministry on November 21 asked the oil regulator PNGRB to determine the marketing margin for supply of domestic gas to urea and LPG producers through its independent process. The rates determined by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) would thereafter be notified by the government, they said.  Also Read: RIL-BP JV can quadruple natural gas production by 2020 In other cases, the Ministry ruled that the marketing margin should be determined by the buyer and seller and any complaints about exercise of monopoly power should be addressed to PNGRB and/or the Competition Commission of India.  Presently, marketing margins charged by producers and sellers of gas are in the range of 11 cents to 20 cents per million British thermal unit (mmBtu). Fertiliser plants had opposed RIL charging 13.5 cents per mmBtu as marketing margin over and above the government fixed price of USD 4.205 for KG-D6 gas.  The Oil Ministry on December 26, 2011, asked PNGRB to determine the quantum of marketing margin chargeable on sale of natural gas to end consumers by a marketing entity. The Board on February 14, 2012 issued notices to companies like RIL and GAIL seeking information on cost of production or import or acquisition of natural gas, the selling price of the fuel to end consumers and itemised detailed break-up of the difference between the two.  However, later in the year, it refused to fix the marketing margin saying it cannot decide on the issue as natural gas as a product has not been formally notified by the government for adjudication by the Board, sources said. On a second reference, the PNGRB advised the government to stipulate a uniform marketing margin for all sellers of domestic gas, while giving free hand to sellers of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and firms selling CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.  This was strongly opposed by RIL, which said the stipulation was discriminatory. RIL, whose 13.5 cents per million British thermal unit as marketing margin on KG-D6 gas is higher than 11 cents charged on gas produced by ONGC/OIL but lower than 20 cents that GAIL charges for western offshore gas and imported LNG, said there was no legal basis to regulate the levy.

The bank guarantee will cover the difference between the current gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units and the rate of USD 8.2-8.4 per million Btu, which will come into effect from April 1. Also read: RIL's KG-D6 output slips to 10 mmscmd  &amp;quot;We are awaiting Finance Ministry comments before a final note is taken to the Cabinet,&amp;quot; the official said, adding that the new gas price, which will be applicable uniformly to all producers, will be notified thereafter. The Oil Ministry had previously proposed that RIL be forced to sell gas from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields at the current rate until it is proved that the 80 per cent fall in output at the fields was due to natural reasons or it makes up for the shortfall in production since 2010-11. This would have meant pronouncing RIL guilty even before trial, he said. The veracity of allegations that RIL hoarded gas in anticipation of a price hike can be established by arbitration or a third-party expert, a process that can take 1-2 years. &amp;quot;If we forced RIL to sell gas at USD 4.2 and at a later date it was established that output had fallen due to geological reasons and there was no hoarding, then who would make good the difference between USD 4.2 and the price they are actually eligible from April 1, 2014?&amp;quot; The official said the government cannot ask consumers to pay a higher price for gas consumed in the period taken to decide on the hoarding charge. The government, he said, could have charged customers the higher price from April 1 and paid RIL the lower rate while keeping the difference in an escrow account until the issue was sorted out. However, the production sharing contract does not provide for escrow accounts. The bank guarantee will be calculated quarterly as the gas price will change every three months, based on average international hub prices and the rate at which LNG (liquefied natural gas) is imported in India. The bank guarantee will be about USD 90 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014-15, considering an anticipated output of less than 8 million metric standard cubic meters perday (mmscmd) from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, after netting the excess royalty that RIL will pay at the higher price.  The official said it is a win-win situation for both sides. The bank guarantee secures the government's interests and the higher gas price protects the operator's interests. If the hoarding allegations are true, the bank guarantees will be encashed, with interest, for the period from April 1 to the date the charges are proved. From April 1, all domestic gas will be priced at an average of international hub prices and imported LNG costs. Prices will be revised quarterly and will be based on the previous one-year average. RIL will have to furnish a bank guarantee of over USD 90 million, assuming a gas price of USD 8.4 per million Btu in April. A lower gas price would have been the second penalty imposed by the Oil Ministry for RIL falling short of stated production targets. It had already levied a USD 1.8 billion&amp;amp;nbsp; penalty for the output drop, an issue that is in arbitration. Gas production from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields fell to 8.7 mmscmd this month from a peak of 54 mmscmd in March 2010. Production has been below target since the latter half of fiscal 2010-11 and should currently have been 80 mmscmd, as per the 2006 investment plan. Output from the MA oil and gas field in the KG-D6 block, too, has fallen over 62 per cent. However, the ministry and the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, the oil regulator, have agreed with RIL's reasoning that geological complexity was responsible for the drop and approved the higher price for the MA field's output.

Asked about the fresh USD 792 billion penalty that the government slapped for producing less than the target in 2012-13, Ganguly said the issue will be part of the arbitration RIL had initited against the previous USD 1.005 billion penalty imposed for output being less than target in 2010-11 and 2011-12. &amp;quot;It is part of the existing arbitration,&amp;quot; he said. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields have in the first fours years of production (2009-10 to 2012-13) produced a total of 1.853 Trillion cubic feet of gas, 1.196 Tcf short of 3.049 Tcf that RIL had committed to produce in the 2006 development plan.  But for the first year, the output has lagged the targets in all subsequent years, which has led to a huge chunk of facilities built lying untilised, according to oil ministry. RIL had built facilities to handle 80&amp;amp;nbsp; mscmd of gas. The company says it did not drill the committed quota of wells as gas reserves are a third of 10.03 Tcf estimated in 2006. It says the production sharing contract does not provide for levy of penalty for producing less than output estimates. "

According to the ministry, while the proposed bank guarantee would secure the government's interests on one hand, the higher pricing would protect the interests of RIL on the other. The bank guarantee is being sought as the government feels that the steep fall in KGD6 gas output is not because of geological reasons, as is being claimed by RIL, but on account of the company's hoarding gas with to make a windfall gain from next April when gas prices will be doubled. If the hoarding allegations are true, the bank guarantees would be encashed with interest for the period from April 1 to the date the charges are proved. Moily met investors, financial institutions and analysts here last night ahead of the forthcoming NELP Round X auctions beginning mid-January. He said unlike the flurry of negative news regarding the issues between the government and RIL, the only major issue is the arbitration settlement, which is pending with the courts now. &amp;quot;We have, over the past few months, cleared as many as USD 7 billion worth investment proposals submitted by RIL,&amp;quot; the minister said, adding that the media was only headlining the negative news. Moily said he expects the Supreme Court to appoint a third arbitrator at the earliest so that the issues between the nation's largest private company and the government could be resolved at the earliest. The ministry had recently asked RIL to provide a bank guarantee of USD 135 million every quarter to get a higher price for natural gas from April 1. The guarantee will be encashed if it is proved that RIL hoarded gas or deliberately suppressed production at the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) -- main gas fields in its Eastern offshore KG-D6 block. It will cover the difference between the current gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units and the proposed new rate of USD 8.4 per million Btu. The ministry had earlier proposed that RIL should be forced to sell gas from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields at the current rate until it is proved that the 80 per cent fall in output was due to natural reasons or it makes up for the shortfall in production since 2010-11. The penalty in the form of the lower gas price would have been the second imposed by the ministry on RIL for falling short of the stated production targets. It had already levied a USD 1.8 billion penalty for the output drop and the issue is before arbitration. Gas production from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields has fallen to less than 10 million standard cubic metres per day from the peak of 54 mmscmd in March 2010. Production has been lower than the target since the latter half of the 2010-11 fiscal and it should currently have been 80 mmscmd, as per the 2006 investment plan. Output from the MA oil and gas field in the KG-D6 block too has fallen by over 62 percent. However, the ministry and the oil regulator-rectorate General of Hydrocarbons - have agreed with RIL's reasoning of geological complexity being responsible for the drop and has approved the higher price for the MA field's output."

The bank guarantee will cover the difference between the current gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units and the rate of USD 8.4 per million Btu, which will come into effect from April 1. The Oil Ministry previously proposed that RIL be forced to sell gas from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields at the current rate until it is proved that the 80 per cent fall in output at the fields was due to natural reasons or it makes up for the shortfall in production since 2010-11. &amp;quot;This, if implemented, would have been nothing short of pronouncing RIL guilty without trial,&amp;quot; the official said. &amp;quot;Suppose we forced them (RIL) to sell gas at USD 4.2 and at a later date it was established that output had actually fallen due to geological reasons and there was no hoarding, then who would make good the difference between USD 4.2 and the price they are actually eligible from April 1, 2014?&amp;quot; The official said the veracity of allegations that RIL was hoarding gas in anticipation of a higher price can be established either by arbitration or by appointing a third-party expert, a process that can take over a year. The government, he said, could have charged customers the higher price applicable from April 1 and paid RIL the lower rate while keeping the difference in an escrow account until the issue was sorted out. However, the production sharing contract does not provide for escrow accounts. Alternatively, the government can allow RIL the increased price, provided the company furnishes a bank guarantee for the incremental amount, which can be encashed if the hoarding charges are proved true later. &amp;quot;The second option is a win-win for both sides - the bank guarantees secure the government's interests and higher gas price protects the operator's interests,&amp;quot; the official said. He added that if the hoarding allegations are true, the bank guarantees would be encashed, with interest, for the period from April 1 to the date the charges are proved. From April 1, all domestic gas will be priced at an average of international hub prices and the cost of LNG imported into India. Prices will change quarterly, based on the previous one-year average. RIL will have to provide a bank guarantee for USD 135 million, presuming a gas price of USD 8.4 per million Btu in April.

The committee also note that the action taken by the ministry in respect of cost disallowance of USD 1.005 billion to contractor based on the arbitration procedure, it said. &amp;quot;In view of the above the committee is of the opinion that non-adherence by the contractor to approved field development plan should be construed as 'default' and not just failure and remedial action by the Ministry in this regard must be premised on 'default' by the contractor not on 'failure',&amp;quot; the committee said. Somabhai Gandalal Koli Patel, Lok Sabha member from Surendranagar constituency of Gujarat, was the acting chairman of the standing committee. Congress MP Vundavalli Arun Kumar, who was chairman of the committee when it was formed, said the recommendations were submitted to the Speaker's office and the Government will have to give the action taken report on the recommendations. The committee observed that the KG D-6 is one of the successful discoveries in the NELP regime which gave hope to the country in its quest for exploration of hydrocarbon resources. According to the committee report, the planned production as per the approved field development plan was 33.83 mmscmd in 2009-10 and to go up to 86.73 mmscmd in 2012-13. However, the production for the KG D-6 basin started declining as the actual production 55.89 in 2010-11 to 26.18 mmscmd in 2012-13. The committee said the contractor has not adhered to the measures suggested by the regulator DGH to drill wells to increase natural gas production. &amp;quot;Also coincidently the demand of the increase in the price of natural gas by the contractor over and above the discovered price by arm length mechanism as provided in the PSC has also brought question mark regarding the interest of contractor to abide in the sanctity and stability of the PSC,&amp;quot; it said. The committee also observed that the study conducted by the expert appointed by the DGH on the decline concluded that the reserves as estimated earlier which are around 10 TCF (Trillion Cubic Feet) are still available and remedial measures will help the production to go up. The cost disallowance of USD 1.005 billion imposed up on RIL was taken for arbitration by the company."

Workover is the process of performing major maintenance or remedial treatment on an oil or gas well. Niko, which holds a 10 percent interest in the KG-D6 block, said in its second-quarter earnings statement that the workovers will &amp;quot;contribute&amp;quot; to an increase in gas production. BP Plc of UK holds the remaining 30 percent in KG-D6. RIL, the operator of the block with a 60 percent stake, produced 12.26 mmscmd from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields and the MA oil and gas field in the block in the Bay of Bengal in the week ended October 27, according to a status report of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). RIL had also shut two of the six wells at the MA field due to high water and sand ingress. The DGH report said the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields produced 9.39 mmscmd of gas, while the remainder came from the MA field.

D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, produced 66.35 mmscmd, while 3.07 mmscmd was the output from the MA field, the only oil discovery on the block. Besides the fall in output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, gas production from the MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, has dropped. Niko said a development well, MA-8, has been spud at the MA field. &amp;quot;The well is expected to be on-stream in December.&amp;quot; The well and the workovers will help reverse the drop in output at KG-D6. Sources said the workovers had been stuck for almost two years as the Oil Ministry and the DGH refused to approve their budgets. They were cleared only after Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily intervened. The DGH report said 12 mmscmd of the last reported output at KG-D6 was sold to urea manufacturing plants and no sale was made to power plants. The remaining production was consumed by the pipeline that transports the KG-D6 gas, it said."

He said the relinquished area will be auctioned in subsequent licensing rounds. The relinquished area does not contain any producing fields. Total reserves in these five discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin are estimated to be 805 billion cubic feet, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Moily in the October 9 order, however, agreed with RIL's contention that the company would retain D29, D30 and D31 gas finds to conduct tests for their confirmation, sources said. Also Read: RIL-BP to invest &amp;amp;#36; 8-10 bn to produce more gas RIL, as per the contractual requirement of retaining only the area where discoveries have been made, had offered to give up or relinquish 5,367 square kilometres out of the total 7,645 sq km area in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block. However, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) wanted another 1,130 sq km of area, which contained these 8 finds, to also be taken away from RIL on the grounds that the timeline to develop the fields had expired. RIL and its partner BP Plc officials on September 18 made a detailed presentation to the Minister, Oil Secretary Vivek Rae and DGH Director General R N Choubey, contending that it had not deviated from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and had the right to retain the 1,130 sq km area. Sources said Moily after examining the issue wrote on the file that, &amp;quot;the contractor should be asked to relinquish corresponding areas pertaining to 5 discoveries (814 sq km) with immediate effect&amp;quot; as RIL had not submitted the field development plan for these within the stipulated timeframe. He wanted this area to be to be offered for bidding on a priority basis. For the balance three finds covering an area of 316 sq km, he agreed with RIL-BP that the DGH had not been insisting on drill stem test (DST) for confirmation of a discovery in the past and had decided to rake up the issue of in absence of DST in case of D29, D30 and D31 finds after 8 months of commerciality documents being submitted and around 40 months from the discovery. &amp;quot;There has been practice in the past not to insist for the DST for declaration of the commerciality (a prerequisite before investment plans are considered) by the DGH and a circular to that effect is still in existence,&amp;quot; Moily wrote. He noted that RIL had submitted declaration of commerciality (DoC) for three finds within time and there was delay on part of the DGH in reviewing them. &amp;quot;Therefore, a fair and balanced approach could be to allow the contractor to conduct DST now and review the DoC on the basis of outcome of these tests,&amp;quot; Moily wrote. Depending on the outcome, the matter may be taken up before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for its information, he added. RIL has 18 oil and gas finds and one oil discovery in the eastern offshore KG-D6. Of these, D26 or MA oil discovery started pumping oil in September 2008 while D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields were put on production in April 2009. The government approved three separate field development plans for six discoveries (D2, D6, D19, D22, D42 and D34). So, the total area of 1,446.12 sq km (corresponding to discoveries D1, D3, D26, D2, D6, D19, D22, D42, D34, D29, D30 and D31) is at present being considered as discovery and development area out of the contract area of 7,645 sq km, sources said. The remaining 6,198.88 sq km is to be relinquished by RIL, they added."

To enable early monetisation of discoveries, Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily on October 21 approved 5-page guidelines for production and development of oil and gas discoveries made within an already producing field. The Ministry had in February allowed companies to explore for more reserves within a currently producing oil and gas field. This permission had led to RIL finding more gas reserves 2 km beneath the currently producing gas fields while Cairn found more oil within its prolific Rajasthan fields. Also Read: Cairn India Q2 net up 8% at Rs 3,385 cr on weak rupee The ministry has now approved a mechanism to enable early monetisation of the finds contained with an already producing area, official sources said. It allowed companies the option to &amp;quot;submit an integrated development plan (IDP) encompassing multiple new discoveries&amp;quot;. Currently, every discovery is treated as a separate factory and operators are required to first get approval of they being commercially viable and then seek approval for an investment plan, called a field development plan (FDP). The Ministry allowed &amp;quot;submission of declaration of commerciality (DOC) and FDP/IDP together by subsuming DOC within the FDP/IDP&amp;quot;. Cases with single discovery will be termed as FDP and in cases of multiple discoveries, it will be termed as IDP, the guidelines said.&amp;amp;nbsp; Sources said the investment required in bringing the discoveries to production can be submitted along with the annual work programme and budget for that block for approval of the block oversight panel, called the Management Committee. &amp;quot;For early monetisation of new discoveries in a mining lease (or producing) areas, the contractor, on his request, may be allowed by the MC to produce hydrocarbons from the&amp;amp;nbsp; notified new discoveries, pending approval of FDP/IDP,&amp;quot; the guidelines said. This is subject to condition that the contract has taken approval of the MC for the annual work programme, budget and program quantity for such new discoveries, it said. These guidelines are path-breaking as it would lead to early monetisation of discoveries. Currently, an operator upon finding oil and gas in a well, has to inform the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), which would recognise it as a discovery only if it gets evidence of physical flow of hydrocarbons on surface. After this, the companies are required to get their commercial viability approved, called Declaration of Commerciality. Once DoC is approved, it submits a FDP for approval and can begin work on bringing the find to production only after the investment plan is approved by MC headed by DGH. "

KGD6 production at 14mmscmd vs. 15mmscmd QoQ continued its declining trend With expected improvement in RIL's business profile in the next 2 years, limited downsides, potential upsides from positive developments in E&amp;amp;amp;P and attractive valuations. Reliance Industries Ltd.'s (RIL) GRMs were in line with our and street expectations. Sequentially, GRMs decreased from USD8.4/bbl to USD7.7/bbl on the back of a decline in product spreads of light/mid-distillates, especially gasoline and FO. This, in turn, caused a dip in EBIT margins by 30bps on a QoQ basis to 3.3 percent to Rs31.7bn. RIL GRM was further dented by a weak light and heavy crude oil spread, which declined by USUSD0.3bbl to USUSD3.7/bbl Benchmark Singapore refining margins also dipped in Q2FY14, averaging USUSD5.4 as against USUSD7/bbl QoQ. This decline was the result of a steep fall in&amp;amp;nbsp; gasoline spreads to USUSD9.7/bbl vs. USUSD11.7/bbl QoQ, and FO spreads to USD-12.3/bbl vs. USD-3.6/bbl QoQ, which forms a higher proportion of the Singapore GRM product slate. Refinery throughput for Q2FY14 stood at 17.7mnt as against 17.1mnt QoQ. RIL's strong performance during the quarter has largely been the result of the weak rupee and better petchem margins. However, it is too early to expect a sustained recovery in petchem margins. In the case of petchem, demand remains a concern. Any weakness in demand could impact a sustained margin recovery. We maintain our weak outlook on the refining cycle for the near term on the back of a higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. The incremental net refining capacity additions are expected to be 1.7mbpd in 2013 as against demand growth of 1mbpd. Gas production from the KG basin is expected to increase in the coming quarters from MA field (D26; part of KGD6). However, incremental production from other fields, mainly Rseries, Satellite Field, etc. depends on gas pricing approval. &amp;quot;Although a positive government stance on RIL's E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts in terms of project approvals and gas pricing augurs well for the company, final results on pricing are yet to be declared. We remain cautious about RIL's refining and petchem margins for the near term, due to new capacities and/or weakening demand. However, with the expected improvement in RIL's business profile in the next 2 years, limited downsides, potential upsides from positive developments in E&amp;amp;amp;P and attractive valuations, we maintain an Accumulate rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs982.

Also read: DGH shifting goalposts to strip off our discoveries: RILSAT has been hearing the appeal filed by RIL against Sebi in the insider-trading case related to its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) dating back to 2007. The company is also contesting the regulator's decision of last May to keep the case out of the consent mechanism, suggesting the amount involved is too high. Under Sebi's consent mechanism, companies can seek to settle cases with the regulator after paying certain charges and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. Hearing the arguments, which have been adjourned eight times in recent past alone, SAT presiding officer J P Devadhar said: &amp;quot;Without going into the merits of the case, we want to know if Sebi can consider RIL's consent application in the interest of justice.&amp;quot;  In response to this, Sebi senior counsel Darius Khambata said he will inform the tribunal after discussing the suggestion with the regulator. Following this, SAT adjourned the further hearing on the petition to October 29. The case dates back to 2007, when before the merger of the RPL with itself, RIL sold 4.1 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum for Rs 4,023 crore in the futures market to allegedly prevent a price correction and later in the spot market, covering the share sales in the futures market. As per the Sebi findings, the company booked a profit of Rs 513 crore in the futures segment through this deal. RPL was later merged with RIL. Sebi claimed that the company was aware of the sale of shares and sold futures ahead of that, therefore amounting to insider trading. Following this Sebi ordered a probe and found that RIL had violated insider-trading norms. Though it approached Sebi for consent settlement, the regulator did not entertain the application, forcing RIL to move SAT. At the last hearing on September 25, SAT had asked Sebi to produce the file on the alleged RIL insider trading case and the notings of the committee that decided to withdraw the company from the consent mechanism. Under the consent mechanism companies/individuals can seek to settle cases with paying a fine but without admitting to or denying any wrongdoing. In case the allegations are proved, then a company may end up paying up to three times the profit made from the illegal trade practices. Accordingly, in the case of RIL, the company could pay over Rs 1,500 crore, as it has been alleged that it booked Rs 513 crore from insider trading. RIL has challenged the show-cause notice issued by Sebi in December 2010 citing that it was not given adequate access to the documents on which the show-cause was based. RIL has also challenged Sebi for taking the case out of the consent process and also for changing the norms governing this mechanism, especially when the case was already under its consideration. In May 2012, Sebi had tightened the consent mechanism framework. As a result, many cases, including those related to insider trading, are not being settled through this mechanism.  On January 3 this year, Sebi published a list of 149 consent pleas, including 16 from entities related to the RIL Group, which it had not found suitable for consent settlement.  These include applications of RIL itself and that of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani's close aide Manoj Modi. At the last hearing, SAT had rejected an intervention petition filed in the case by a little-known Urdu daily editor M Furquan who claimed that there could be possible collusion between Sebi and RIL to settle the matter.  The matter was last heard by SAT on February 21, when the tribunal sought time to study the application, which Sebi termed as &amp;quot;not maintainable&amp;quot;. Since then RIL has been seeking adjournments. The case has been adjourned every month since March. "

RIL as per contractual requirement of retaining only the area where discoveries have been made, had offered to give up or relinquish 5,367 square kilometers out of the total 7,645 sq km area in the block. But the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) wants another 1,130 sq km of area, which contains the 8 discoveries, to also be taken away from RIL on the grounds that the time line to develop the fields had expired. RIL in a presentation to Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily and his top ministry brass last month, said it had not deviated an inch from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and had the right to retain the 1,130 sq km area. If DGH is to carve out this area and auction it, the new company will not be able to produce from these before 8-10 years, it said. RIL on the other hand plans to integrate the finds, which are small or marginal in nature and &amp;quot;unviable&amp;quot; on standalone basis, with other finds in the block and produce by 2017-18. Of the eight discoveries in 1,130 sq km area, the DGH refused to consider investment plans for five, with 0.805 Tcf of reserves, saying they were not viable at the current price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units. The regulator refused to recognise the other three as discoveries in the absence of prescribed tests to confirm them and then disallowed pleas by Reliance and partner BP Plc for time to do the tests. RIL said the declaration of commerciality (DoC) - a prerequisite before investment plans are considered - for D-29, 30 and 31 was &amp;quot;submitted in February 2010 and DGH raised requirement of DST (Drill Stem Test) after 8 months of DoC submission and around 40 months from discovery well.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;PSC also leaves selection of testing to the contractor's best technical judgment. Contractor conducted Modular Dynamic Test (MDT) and is of the opinion that DST is not required,&amp;quot; it said, adding that to resolve the impasse and to expedite development of resources it has offered to carry out DST as well. For the balance five finds (D4, 7, 8, 16 and 23), it said DGH in March 209 found USD 4.2 price &amp;quot;uneconomical&amp;quot; for their development along with five other discoveries and asked RIL to optimise the field development plan. RIL in December 2009 submitted a optimised field development plan, proposing to develop four finds (D2, 6, 19 and 22) first and balance 5 (D4, 7, 8, 16 and 23) later and disagreed with evaluation of USD 4.2 per mmBtu. It said the development plan was neither denied nor withdrawn and so area of the five discoveries is valid and cannot be taken away."

We don't want to prevent any truth from coming out,&amp;quot; he told reporters on the sidelines of a conference organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce. Oil regulator DGH has blamed RIL's failure to drill committed wells for the gas output falling by 80 percent to 10 million standard cubic metres per day from the main D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 fields in KG-D6 block, instead of rising to the planned 80 mmscmd. On the other hand, RIL and its partner BP plc of UK feel that the reserves have dropped one-third to under 3 trillion cubic feet due to previously unknown geological factors and the undrilled quota of 11 wells would not increase production. Moily's ministry has been mulling appointing an international reservoir expert to ascertain facts. &amp;quot;Truth is truth, nobody can prevent it, nobody can manoeuvre it,&amp;quot; he said adding his ministry was &amp;quot;consciously&amp;quot; working towards unravelling the truth. DGH wants USD 1.786 billion penalty to be levied on RIL for its &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot; to produce projected quantity of gas as Oil Ministry in a parallel move wants the company to be denied the benefit of gas price revision upon expiry of current USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit rate in April 2014. &amp;quot;The question is that if gas is available, yes gas is available.

A KG-D6 block oversight panel headed by DGH had earlier this week refused to take a view on appointing renowned reservoir consultants Ryder Scott, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&amp;amp;amp;M), Gaffney, Cline &amp;amp;amp; Associates (GCA) or Netherland, Sewell &amp;amp;amp; Associates to validate reasons for the fall in gas output. Oil Ministry officials - Aramane Giridhar, Joint Secretary (Exploration); S C Khuntia, Additional Secretary &amp;amp;amp; Financial Advisor and VLVSS Subba Rao, Advisor (Finance) - attending the one-hour long MC meeting did not convey any decision. RIL-BP feel drilling of the remaining 11 wells would require over USD 1.65 billion investment while the currently available reserves can be produced by spending around USD 0.5 billion in repairs and compression of existing wells. The appointment of an independent international expert, which RIL-BP have been pressing for several months now, would establish who is right and who is wrong, sources said. "

Moily's ministry sees production not meeting stated targets are breach of contract and has levied USD 1.786 billion in penalty by way of disallowing cost incurred in past three fiscal. Also, it plans to deny RIL benefit of new price after the current USD 4.2 expires in April next year. &amp;quot;A double penalty to the contractor: On one hand cost recovery being disallowed on the other market price being denied,&amp;quot; RIL said in the presentation. It said under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), output figures in a development plan are only estimates and not commitments. &amp;quot;There is no provision in the PSC that allows Government to penalise the contractor if production shortfall is caused by geological complexities,&amp;quot; it said adding the contract allows RIL to recover all its costs. On move to disallow new USD 8.4 per million British thermal unit price for gas from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, RIL said, &amp;quot;there appears to be significant contradiction to the government's positions with regards to PSUs who have been granted a nearly 2.5 times price increase despite shortfall in production.&amp;quot;  RIL said geological surprise has led to decline in production and subsequent downgrading of reserves. Stating that it had on numerous occasions requested to appoint an independent international expert to verify its claims, the company said, &amp;quot;Reluctance to appoint a third party exert despite repeated requests and delay in approval of revised field development plan has led to a negative propaganda perpetrated by detractors.&amp;quot; . The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons had in July recommended to the Oil Ministry that USD 781 million of the cost RIL has incurred in KG-D6 fields be disallowed for producing only an average of 26.07 million cubic meters per day of gas as against the target of 86.73 mmcmd in 2012-13. This will be in addition to USD 1.005 billion in cost recovery already disallowed for output falling short of targets during 2010-11 and 2011-12. Parallely, the Ministry is moving Cabinet to deny RIL a higher price of gas produced from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields till the dispute over the reasons for output not matching targets is resolved. It wants the current rate of USD 4.2 to continue to apply for gas produced from Dhirubhai-1 (D1) and D3 fields even after expiry of the current term on March 31, 2014. The government had in late June approved pricing of all domestically produced natural gas at an average of international hub rates and actual cost of LNG into India from next fiscal. The new rate, according to this formula, would be around USD 8.4 per mmBtu. The new rates were to apply uniformly to gas from RIL fields as well as those of state-owned ONGC. Now, the Ministry wants the old rates to continue for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields but the new price would apply to all other fields in the KG-D6 block including the currently producing MA oil and gas fields."

But finance ministry had some constraints... so we bifurcated that allowing national oil companies first,&amp;quot; Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily said on the sidelines of the HSE Conference organised by Cairn India here. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Tuesday approved the long-awaited shale gas and oil exploration programme to boost domestic output.In the first phase, state-owned ONGC and OIL have been permitted to explore for and produce shale oil and gas from onland blocks that were allotted on a nomination basis before advent of the New Exploration Licensing Policy in 1999. The government will offer shale oil and gas blocks to other companies through an auction planned after such a policy is taken to the Cabinet for approval in the next few weeks.  The policy for allowing private firms to also explore and produce shale oil and gas &amp;quot;will come very soon,&amp;quot; he said. Shale gas, or natural gas trapped in sedimentary rocks (shale formations) below the earth's surface, is the new focus area in the US, Canada and China as an alternative to conventional oil and gas for meeting growing energy needs. As per available data, six basins -- Cambay (in Gujarat), Assam-Arakan (in the North-East), Gondawana (in central India), KG onshore (in Andhra Pradesh), Cauvery onshore and Indo-Gangetic basins, hold shale gas potential.  Various studies have estimated recoverable reserves of shale gas at between 6 trillion cubic feet and 63 trillion cubic feet. Shale production will be taxed at par with conventional fields. &amp;quot;Initially, I was in favour of an integrated shale gas policy but due to certain issues we decided to take the first step (of allowing state-owned firms to explore),&amp;quot; Moily said."

Reliance Executive Director P.M.S. Prasad on August 24 wrote a strongly worded letter to Oil Secretary Vivek Rae, questioning the intent of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) in asking the company to give up 6,601 sq km out of the total 7,645 sq km area in the block on the grounds that the time line to develop the fields had expired.  Of the eight discoveries in the area, the DGH refused to consider investment plans for five, with 0.8 trillion cubic feet of reserves, saying they were not viable at the current price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units.  Also read: OilMin seeks legal opinion on levying &amp;amp;#36;781mn penalty on RIL The regulator refused to recognise the other three as discoveries in the absence of prescribed tests to confirm them and then disallowed pleas by Reliance and partner BP Plc for time to do the tests.  &ldquo;In spite of the PSC providing for sale of gas at market prices, and the approved price of USD 4.2 being only valid until March 31, 2014, DGH insisted on evaluating the proposed development plan (of five discoveries) at a gas price of USD 4.2 and declared them to be unviable,&rdquo; Mr. Prasad said, adding this was done even after the knowledge that the field would start production much later than April 2014.  Mr. Prasad said Reliance-BP had agreed to carry out the DGH-prescribed drill stem test to confirm the three discoveries but the regulator never approved them and was now insisting on relinquishment of the areas.  In the 11-page letter with point-by-point rebuttals to the DGH claims, a copy of which was marked to Oil Minister M. Veerappa Moily, Mr. Prasad asked Mr. Rae to &ldquo;advise the concerned to rectify the errors and remove the hurdles which are needlessly delaying further progression in these discoveries.&rdquo;  RIL had offered to relinquish 4,233 sq km of &ldquo;low prospectivity area&rdquo; in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in keeping with the contractual requirement to retain only portions needed to produce oil and gas.  The area RIL is seeking to retain contains the 20 oil and gas finds it has made till date.  &ldquo;Needlessly projecting RIL as a defaulter and forcing the contractor to relinquish discovered resources will not only hurt the investor but considerably reduce the chances of many of these discoveries ever being produced,&rdquo; Mr. Prasad said.  &ldquo;Contractor (RIL) is of the view that the action is clearly an afterthought, based on arbitrary decision and tantamount to disputing completely valid discoveries made at the contractor&rsquo;s risk,&rdquo; he wrote.  Mr. Prasad said the discoveries were unilaterally declared unviable by the DGH without a discussion by the block oversight panel or taking its views into consideration.  &ldquo;Under normal course it would be considered bad faith to take a biased unilateral view, which...delayed further progress for development, and then turn around to blame the contractor for expiry of time period,&rdquo; he said.  RIL, he said, had &ldquo;spent enormous amount of time and money on bringing these discoveries to fruition&rdquo; and would &ldquo;suffer immensely if pushed to a situation of forced relinquishment of rightful discoveries.&rdquo;  The area proposed for cessation has at least 1.15 trillion cubic feet of known recoverable gas reserves valued at USD 4.83 billion at current prices.  Of the 20 finds, RIL began crude oil production from MA field in September 2008. It started gas output from MA field and Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3, the largest of the gas discoveries in the block, in April 2009.  The DGH proposed that RIL should retain only an area of 1,044 sq km, which holds the currently producing D1 and D3 gas and MA oil and gas fields, besides a cluster of four satellite fields (D-2, 6, 19 and 22) and another D-34 discovery.  RIL had in its March 13 proposal wanted to retain 3,412 sq km containing all the oil and gas finds made till date.  Contractually, companies are required to relinquish 25 per cent of the area in an oil and gas block at the end of the first phase of exploration that spans three years.  At the end of second phase, 50 per cent of the area is to be given up. By the third phase, only the area needed for development and production of a discovery is allowed to be retained. The second and third phases are of two years duration each.  RIL was awarded the KG-D6 block in 2000. The three-year first phase ended on June 7, 2003, and the third phase ended on June 7, 2007.  Sources said the DGH in 2006 agreed to RIL&rsquo;s proposal to declare the entire area as a discovery, allowing the company to retain it. The decision was ratified by a committee headed by additional secretary in the ministry and by the Oil Minister thereafter.  However, the decision was questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the government auditor, as only 79 per cent of the block area had been covered by 3D seismic survey at the end of the third phase and yet it had been declared a discovery area.  The CAG, in its performance audit in 2011, had asked the ministry to review the determination of the entire KG-D6 contract area as a &lsquo;discovery area&rsquo;  &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Also Read: Govt move to force old gas price for KG-D6 gas illegal: RIL The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons had in July recommended to the Oil Ministry that USD 781 million of the cost RIL has incurred in KG-D6 fields be disallowed for producing only an average of 26.07 million cubic meters per day of gas as against the target of 86.73 mmcmd in 2012-13. This will be in addition to USD 1.005 billion in cost recovery already disallowed for output falling short of targets during 2010-11 and 2011-12. The arbitration has not begun because the two arbitrators appointed by RIL and the government are yet to agree on a neutral presiding judge for the proceedings. CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta has previously alleged that Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily was scuttling the arbitration proceedings but when RIL moved the Supreme Court seeking appointment of the third arbitrator at the earliest, he too moved the Apex Court seeking stay on the arbitration proceedings. Officials said since arbitration proceedings on the previous penalty issue are yet to commence, it was thought prudent to seek opinion of the Law Ministry on levying further penalty.  DGH blames RIL for not drilling its committed quota of wells for the fall in production that has resulted in a large chunk of production facilities lying unused or under-utilised.  RIL has built infrastructure to handle 80 mmscmd of output but is currently producing less than 14 mmscmd.  As per the production sharing contract, RIL and its partners BP Plc and Niko Resources are allowed to deduct all of the capital and operating expenses from sale of gas before sharing profits with the government.  Creation of excess or unutilised infrastructure impacts government's profit share and this is being sought to be corrected by disallowing part of the cost. DGH, the official said, stated that after cost disallowance, RIL would be required to pay USD 114 million in additional profit petroleum to the government for 2012-13 in addition to USD 103 million that was already due. RIL and its partners have so far undertaken USD 5.768 billion investment in developing the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas field in KG-D6 block and another USD 1.74 billion in the MA oilfield in the same area. Another USD 1.774 billion has been spent as production expenses or operating cost. The Ministry had in May 2012 slapped a notice disallowing USD 457 million of cost till 2010-11 and USD 1.005 billion till 2011-12. The average gas production from KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6 block) during the current year should have been 86.92 mmcmd as per the approved field development plans for D1, D3 and MA fields in this block, which are currently on production.  The output has dropped after hitting a peak of about 62 mmcmd in August 2010. The production has fallen as half of the wells of D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and a third of those in MA field have shut due to water loading/sand ingress. Additionally, DGH blames RIL for not drilling all of its committed 31 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3.  RIL on the other hand attributes the fall to substantial variance in reservoir behaviour and character than previously predicted sharp decline in pressure and early water production in some wells."

G-4 gas field lies about 10-km away from RIL's facilities in the offshore.  Aker Solutions is likely to be hired to see the economic and technical feasibility of laying a pipeline to take the gas from G-4 field to RIL's offshore gas gathering and then to its landfall facilities at Gadimoga near Kakinada. ONGC had in July signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with RIL to explore the possibility of sharing Mukesh Ambani-run firm's infrastructural facility in the East Coast. Officials said before hiring Aker, ONGC is referring the issue to CVC as the Norwegian firm is also likely to be a bidder for G-4 field development contracts. Once CVC clears, Aker will be hired. If successful, the same concept will be explored for the nine gas discoveries in ONGC's KG block KG-DWN-98/2, which sits next to RIL's flagging KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. ONGC, they said, wants to develop G-4 together with the finds in the northern part of its KG-DWN-98/2 block by 2017.&amp;amp;nbsp;Instead of putting separate gas processing and transportation facilities, ONGC is looking to hire RIL's under-utilised gas gathering station at KG-D6 fields along with pipelines that take the fuel to onland as also its processing plant at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. RIL has pipeline and other facilities capable of handling gas output of 80 million standard cubic meters per day.  KG-D6 output has dipped to below 14 mmscmd from 69 mmscmd achieved in March 2010 and the company indicated it may never touch 80 mmscmd due to unexpected geological complexities. ONGC aims to cut capital expenditure as also expedite field development by using RIL's infrastructure. The infrastructure sharing would help in early monetisation of its deep water fields adjacent to the fields of RIL, they said.&amp;amp;nbsp; It plans to produce about 6-9 mmscmd of gas from G-4 and D &amp;amp;amp; E fields in KG-DWN-98/2 block in the first phase. ONGC has found 4.85 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in nine gas discoveries it has made in the Krishna-Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/2. The block is targeted for production by 2016-17 and a peak production of 22 mmscmd is envisaged.  Gas from these is proposed to be produced by combining them with a gas discovery in the adjacent block. The Northern Discovery Area (NDA) consists of the Padmawati, Kanakadurga, Annapurna, D/KT, U, A, W and E gas finds in water depths ranging from 594 metres to 1,283 m.

Rejecting RIL's offer to relinquish 4,233 sq km of &amp;quot;low prospectively area&amp;quot; in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, the DGH had stated that the company should contractually give up 6,601 sq km out of the total 7,645 sq km total area in the block. If Moily decides to accept RIL's offer to enable the company to develop all of the 19 oil and gas discoveries made in the block so far, the proposal will have to go to the Cabinet as it would amount to making changes in signed production sharing contract, officials said. DGH Director General R N Choubey had on April 15 written to Oil Secretary Vivek Rae that of the 19 oil and gas discoveries claimed by RIL, three finds have not been established as commercially viable in absence of test data and the company has not submitted any investment plans for another five. According to DGH's own calculations, 6,601 sq km of contract area proposed for cessation has at least 1.15 trillion cubic feet of known recoverable gas reserves valued at USD 4.83 billion at current prices. Of the 19 finds, RIL began crude oil production from MA field in September 2008. It started gas output from MA field and Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries in the block, in April 2009. Contractually, companies are required to relinquish 25 per cent of the area in an oil and gas block at the end of first phase of exploration that spans three years. At the end of second phase, 50 per cent of the area is to be given up and by the third phase only such area is allowed to be retained where the company has made a discovery and is required for development and production of the same. The second and third phases are of two years duration each.  &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;"

In a strongly worded letter, RIL on September 3 wrote to Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily saying the signed Production Sharing Contract (PSC) does not bind a contractor to indicative production numbers. &amp;quot;Neither the PSC nor the field development plan (or investment proposal) even suggest that a shortfall in production can be considered a breach for which penalties can be levied,&amp;quot; RIL Executive Director P M S Prasad wrote. RIL, he said, has on numerous occasions asked Government to appoint an independent and industry renowned third party technical expert to verify performance of the fields and see if the company was hoarding gas to get benefit of higher price. While no expert has been appointed till date, an &amp;quot;illegal&amp;quot; action with no precedent in the country or in the international petroleum industry practice was being purportedly considered, he said. Prasad said any move to penalise it on allegations of hoarding gas made by certain vested interests having little familiarity with techno-commercial operations of oil and gas industry will be against the PSC. The PSC provides for all reserves and production numbers provided in a field plan are only estimates derived on basis of reservoir understanding at a given point of time. So RIL's estimate of 80 million standard cubic meters per day of gas output from KG-D6 for the current year was based on geological understanding in 2006 which is far removed from actual operations where rapid sand and water ingress shut half the wells and brought down output to less than 14 mmscmd. Prasad said it was not for the first time that a field has not performed up to its anticipation and cited examples of ONGC and OIL, who were never questioned for shortfalls. &amp;quot;The action being proposed by its very nature discriminatory. Any move to penalise RIL for failure to produce so called 'committed' quantities of gas is violative of the PSC, unfair and prejudicial to the interests of the contractor besides being in breach of the contract,&amp;quot; he said. Prasad said such a move would &amp;quot;shatter investor confidence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;stifle further private investments in exploration&amp;quot; as companies will see it as government reneging its commitment in a signed contract."

The regulatory environment has also improved, in our view, with an increase in domestic natural gas prices,&amp;quot; it said in a report. Also, its US shale oil/gas and retail segments are &amp;quot;growing faster than our estimates, and we believe RIL has so far shown a balanced approach in its telecom business,&amp;quot; it said. Also read: RIL eyes oil blocks in Venezuela RIL, according to Goldman, offers the best downstream exposure in the Asian oil sector with its high quality asset base, diversified product portfolio, efficient management of inventory valuation swings and ability to fund large organic expansionary capex without taking on debt. Last year, apart from being a top performer among Indian energy stocks, RIL also outperformed regional/global peers as well as the Indian market. &amp;quot;Moreover, RIL is a key beneficiary of the weakening Rupee-US dollar exchange rates, as its revenues for all businesses except retail are in USD and we estimate about 50 per cent of the benefit of higher revenues fall to the PBT level after adjusting for higher interest payments on its USD debt,&amp;quot; it said. Every one rupee depreciation in rupee against US dollar would lead to 2 per cent improvement in RIL's FY14-17 net profit. Goldman said RIL has commenced work on all the major value-enhancing projects such as petcoke gasification project and refinery off-gas cracker project (ROGC) and is in various stages of detailed engineering/ordering equipment. &amp;quot;We expect the company to deliver the projects on time given that these have already got environment clearance and RIL already has land for the projects,&amp;quot; the report said. Goldman said the regulatory environment for RIL has also started turning positive, particularly in the E&amp;amp;amp;P business where RIL has seen a series of approvals for its capex plans in recent quarters. In addition, the government has announced an increase in natural gas prices based on an oil and international gas-linked formula that could potentially double gas prices in FY'15. Also, the recent increase in custom duties for polymers is an indication that the government's intention is of helping domestic producers. &amp;quot;Despite having the highest capex amongst its Asia peers, RIL continues to have a strong balance sheet,&amp;quot; it added.  On the recent turnaround in the E&amp;amp;amp;P business, Goldman said RIL and its partner BP plc made the first success in the KG basin block D6 in May 2013, when they encountered 155 metres of gas condensate column in a new reservoir. &amp;quot;This discovery looks significant given that the largest D6 discovery had a gross hydrocarbon column of 194 mts (MA-2 well). Moreover, if this discovery leads to a new commercial reservoir, it could meaningfully add to D6 reserves,&amp;quot; it said. Recent gas condensate discovery in deep-water Cauvery basin in August 2013 with hydrocarbon column of 143 mts, following a similar discovery in 2007. On RIL's US shale operations, Goldman said Marcellus shale gas is now profitable with Henry Hub moving closer to the USD 3.5-4 per million British thermal unit range. &amp;quot;In organised retail, RIL turned EBITDA-positive in FY13 and we believe, is on track to report a net profit in FY15,&amp;quot; it added. On the 4G telecom venture, RIL, it said, seems to have acted prudently so far by avoiding any major cash burn in this non-core venture by getting into infrastructure tie-ups with existing telecom players rather than embarking on full-fledged telecom infrastructure building or buying assets/companies. &amp;quot;RIL has also indicated that it is only looking at overseas opportunities related to its core businesses with strategic importance and synergies rather than in new/unrelated ventures,&amp;quot; it added.  &amp;amp;nbsp;"

NELP also provided for market determined pricing of both oil and gas. While the government is now identifying customers and nominating quantities to be sold, it is now mandating a price according to a formula given by a committee under Prime Minister's economic advisor C Rangarajan.

New rates will, however, apply to gas produced from other fields like R-Series in the same block. The old rate being proposed is besides the USD 1.793 billion penalty on RIL for producing less than targets even though the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) does not provide for output targets or companies being held to indicative production levels. &amp;quot;As you see there is a continuous erosion of this NELP by taking away several of the rights that were given under the NELP. I don;t want to go into the details but that is what is happening today. You bring in all kinds of extenous factors into the business, not honour the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), that is the worst thing that can happen.

One is, we have a long term (crude oil) supply contract and we are looking at enhancing the quantities under this contract, possibly from next year,&amp;quot; RIL Executive Director P M S Prasad told reporters on sidelines of a FICCI event. Also read: Loss on subsidised fuel sale may hit Rs 1.8 lakh cr: Moily RIL currently imports about 300,000 barrels per day of oil from Venezuela for processing at its twin refineries at Jamangar in Gujarat. It now wants to increase these volumes, possibly to 400,000 bpd. &amp;quot;The second is, we are also looking at investing in Venezuela... They have given us 2-3 opportunities for us to evaluate and make a decision. So, in the next few months complete our evaluation and make a decision,&amp;quot; he said.  Venezuela has offered 2-3 oil blocks. Years after it dropped out of a ONGC-led consortium for developing Venezuela's giant oil fields, RIL is now keen on taking a project to produce heavy oil in the South American nation. It last year signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, to develop a project in the Orinoco extra heavy crude belt. Though Prasad did not elaborate on the &amp;quot;opportunities&amp;quot; offered by Venezuela, RIL may be looking at the Boyaca 4 block and a separate section in the Ayacucho area of the Orinoco belt. Both these areas can produce 2,00,000 bpd (10 million tonnes a year) each.  He, however, said the project may involve developing the field and setting up an upgrader to convert the synthetic oil into oil that can be processed in refineries. Last year, RIL had also signed a new agreement to buy more crude oil from Venezuela. It had in 2008 signed a deal to buy 150,000 bpd of oil, which was gradually raised to 270,000 bpd. Under the new 15-year agreement, the South American country would sell between 300,000 and 400,000 bpd. RIL operates twin refineries at Jamnagar with a total refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. Half of its crude diet can be heavy oil. Prasad said RIL was looking at opportunities to invest in Mexico, Iraq, Canada and Myanmar. RIL was in 2009 supposed to bid with the Indian consortium of ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian Oil Corp and Oil India Ltd for one of the three giant oil blocks Venezuela was offering through auction. It, however, walked out of the consortium possibly due to delays in bidding.  After RIL's exit, OVL-IOC-OIL teamed up with Repsol YPF SA, Spain's biggest oil company, and Malaysia's Petronas to make a successful bid for the massive Carabobo-1 project in Venezuela's Orinoco heavy oil belt. The field, which had about 50 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, can produce a minimum of 400,000 bpd of oil. "

The LNG terminal will have two LNG storage tanks. It will have LNG receiving, re-gasification and gas evacuation facilities.  GSPC has awarded the front-end engineering and design (FEED) contract to Tractebel of Belgium.

The panel, headed by former finance minister Yashwant Sinha said, a cap was necessary to avoid the potential for unlimited gains to local producers due to an upswing in global prices. The recommendations of the panel are similar to those of the finance ministry that were sent to oil ministry. Minister M Veerappa Moily has said gas pricing will not be reviewed. Recommendations of the panel are not binding but usually have a bearing on government policy. Revision in gas pricing is seen as benefiting Reliance Industries , whose existing contracts for gas sales from block D6 on the east coast are expiring on April 1, 2014. Output from the block, which was expected to contribute up to a quarter of the gas supply in the country, has been falling since April 2010, cutting supply of the fuel to the power and other sectors. The committee's report on the 'Economic Impact of Gas Price Revision' also asked the government to ensure Reliance delivers any shortfall of gas it owes to customers at the old price of USD 4.2 per mmBtu. Current gas output from block D6 is about 14 million cubic metres a day (mmscmd), way below the expected 80 mmscmd. BP owns 30 percent of block D6 and Niko Resources has a 10-percent share."

GRM was at US&amp;amp;#36;8.4 bbl versus US&amp;amp;#36;8.5 in the previous quarter. Street had predicted profit to go up by 17-20 percent given the low base last year. Petrochemicals (petchem) earnings reduced due to the lack of improvement in oil and gas sector. As a result, we are slightly bearish on petchem segment. The management is optimistic about the petrochemicals business, where it is expanding capacity as it is investing heavily in the petchem business. RIL&rsquo;s new capacities are expected to start operations slowly and steadily from possibly H2FY14 onwards. However, according to us, its effect would be far sighted. At Ajcon, we believe, unless the petchem segment really starts outperforming from current scale, the positive impact on earnings and stock price performance would be modest. RIL&rsquo;s refining segment was also not performing well and there was not much capacity addition. We believe the Company should have gained slightly better because of the currency gain. At CMP, RIL trades at 12x FY15E EPS of Rs 74.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We recommend: &amp;quot;SELL&amp;quot; for short term with a target of Rs 840&amp;quot; in the immediate term as it has witnessed a strong rally recently and historically RIL&lsquo;s other income showed a steep increase of 33 percent as compared to last year of Rs 2,535 crore, a historic high . Ideally, its earnings should have been bolstered by core business income rather than treasury gains which disappointed us. Structurally, the Company&rsquo;s profitability metrics has been under pressure, led by business slowdown resulting into sharp decline of EBITDA margin from 15.4 percent in FY11 and 10.2 percent in FY12 to 8.5 percent in FY13. RoCE for the Petchem/E&amp;amp;amp;P segments has declined from 20 percent/10 percent a year ago to 13 percent/7 percent in FY13. In the interim period from present to 2015 gross refining margin volatility would definitely hurt investor confidence and RoE reaching sub 12 percent in FY13,&amp;quot; says Ajcon Global research report.

At present, only a third of the 72 mmcmd of gas requirement of the 18,713 MW gas-based power plants is being met. Another 8,000 MW capacity is almost ready for commissioning but there is no gas availability to fire the plants. While options like gas from new production like that of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) being solely dedicated to power plants are being explored, fertiliser ministry has been asked if it can spare any quantity that is unutilised in events like plant shutdowns, etc. The EGoM meeting last week was convened to consider abolishing the priority ranking in natural gas allocation so that the fuel currently consumed by urea plants can also be diverted to fuel-starved power plants. Currently, fertiliser plants consume all of the 14 mmscmd of gas produced from Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 fields. No gas flows to 25 power plants that had signed up for 29.74 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas. "

He however advises long term investors to accumulate the stock on every fall.  Reliance Industries today reported a gross refining margin of USD 8.4 per barrel for the April-June quarter as compared to USD 7.6 in same quarter last year.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview Q: What is your call on the stock now? First of all these numbers do they surprise you or do you think they are inline with your estimates? A: The numbers are almost inline with estimates. Their project type as well as the recent gas price hike, coke re-gasification and improvement in the gas volume etc are likely to benefit the company by 2016, all these things are synchronising in 2016-2017.  If you look at from the longer-term perspective you will find that things are going in favour of Reliance Industries, but if you see the interim period from here to maybe till 2015 gross refining margin volatility is something where I am a bit worried. If you look at the Reliance earnings, 50 percent of the earnings comes from the refining business alone. So, considering the long gestation period of the project I would suggest to accumulate this stock whenever it falls. I guess that will be the right time to accumulate for the long-term investors."

We have presented options and it is for the EGoM to take a call. I can't say anything more than that,&amp;quot; oil minister M Veerappa Moily said in New Delhi. The current priority-ranking meant that when output from Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 fields started falling in 2011, supplies to refineries was cut first, then to steel and city gas sectors. From November 2011, supplies to 25 power plants, which had signed for 29.74 million standard cubic metres per day&amp;amp;nbsp; (mmscmd) of KG-D6, were pro-rata cut and this year completely stopped as KG-D6 output kept falling. From June 1, supplies to LPG plants, which had contracted 2.59 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas, too has stopped as current production of just over 14 mmscmd was sufficient to meet the full requirement of fertiliser sector only. The ministry has proposed two options &mdash; equal priority to all core sectors of fertilisers, LPG, power and city gas distribution or according fertiliser and power equal priority. The gas supplies would be redistributed among the&amp;amp;nbsp; sector users &amp;quot;pro-rated based on the signed gas supply agreements&amp;quot;. If available gas is to be redistributed among the four core sectors, it would reduce supplies to fertiliser plants by 9.44 mmscmd and lead to an extra urea import of 4.73 million tonne that would levy an additional subsidy burden&amp;amp;nbsp; of about Rs 5,591 crore per annum. On the other hand, supply to the power sector will increase by 10.07 mmscmd, resulting in additional production of&amp;amp;nbsp; about 16,000 million units of electricity per annum. Sources said the ministry reasoned that the production cost of&amp;amp;nbsp; power projects forced to use re-gasified LNG would go down by Rs 10,900 crore per annum. The ministry's second option giving equal priority to the power sector, as is available to the fertiliser sector, would mean gas supply to urea plants would go down by 9.07 mmscm forcing an import of 4.54 million tonnes of urea at an&amp;amp;nbsp; additional subsidy burden of Rs 5,372 crore per annum.  Gas to power sector would go up by 10.79 mmscmd leading to an extra output of about 17,000 million electricity units&amp;amp;nbsp; per annum, saving in production cost of Rs 11,700 crore per annum."

Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) on July 11 authorised the Mukesh Ambani-led RGPL to lay the pipeline from Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh to Phulpur near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. The pipeline will have a capacity to transport 4.3 million standard cubic metres per day of gas including 0.875 mmscmd capacity which will be available for any third party for open access on non-discriminatory basis. PNGRB in the authorisation order said the pipeline will travel from Shahdol to JaysingNagar to Beohari to Gurh and finally culminate at Phulpur. At Phulpur, the pipeline may be hooked into state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd's main Hazira-Vijaypur-Jagdishpur trunk gas pipeline. Connection with HVJ would enable gas to flow to any consumer.

RIL had in March-end submitted a USD 3.5 billion Integrated Field Development Plan for producing 10 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the discoveries D-32, D-40, D-9 and D-10 in the Block NEC-OSN-97/2 (NEC-25) by mid-2019.  Also read: FinMin wants RIL to supply outstanding gas at old rate DGH, the nodal technical arm of Oil Ministry, has however refused to bring the development plan to block oversight panel, called the Management Committee, for approval disputing commerciality of D-32 and D-40 in absence of Drill Stem Tests (DSTs) to confirm the finds.  Sources with direct knowledge of the development said the issue has now been referred to the Oil Ministry as at least half a dozen discoveries in the now producing KG-D6 block of RIL and several of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had been declared commercial in past without a DST being done.  RIL and its partner BP plc of UK, they said, have stated that DGH should have insisted on DST being done when discoveries were being appraised some years back and not now when development plan has come up for approval.  They also feel DSTs are not just expensive proposition that will have bearing on government's profit take but also not conclusive tests to confirm production profile.  The sources said that on DGH insistence, RIL, operator of the block, has agreed to do DSTs but now the upstream nodal agency says the exploration phase of the block is over and so even those cannot be permitted.  The Ministry, which has been pushing for speedy development of discoveries to raise domestic output so that imports can be cut, will now decide if DGH is right in insisting on DST now and not at the time of confirmation appraisals done some years back.  DGH had recently rejected Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) of three discoveries in the flagging KG-D6 block on grounds of no separate DST being done.  The sources said DGH also refused to provide sanction for drilling of a well to carry out the requisite DST on finds in NEC-25 required to prove commerciality by claiming that the timeline for drilling such a well is over.  It rejected an RIL attempt to begin pre-development activities on the ground that these discoveries cannot be treated as &amp;quot;commercial&amp;quot; in the absence of sustainable production testing data.  According to RIL, D-32 and D-40 hold an inplace reserve of up to 663 billion cubic feet capable of producing 170 million standard cubic feet per day.  RIL holds 60 per cent interest in the block, while British energy major BP and Canada's Niko Resources hold 30 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.  Sources said RIL has argued that conventional short-term DST provided information on instantaneous well rates and did not provide sustainable well production rates.  It argued that sustainable field production levels could be established through an integrated approach (where seismic- MDT-log data is integrated) without carrying out individual DSTs. This approach has the remarkable ability to correctly forecast the well production rates, the company argued.  International operators like BP have used these techniques as the basis for reserve bookings and investment decisions in the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and other established hydrocarbon basins.  The company further argued that as the NEC block is located in simple sandstone reservoir and is dry in nature, there was no need for DSTs to establish sustainable production levels.  In this light, RIL opined that not carrying out DST should not come in the way of commercial evaluation of a gas discovery and an &amp;quot;integrated approach&amp;quot; was best suited for the block.  RIL has nine gas discoveries in the northern part of the NEC-25 block, and six in the southern area.  RIL and its partners had submitted development plan for the NEC-25 block after the government cleared it for future drilling activities by relaxing &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; conditions put by defence establishment.  The NEC-25 block will be the second major block of RIL to start production after D6 Block in the Krishna-Godavari Basin.  Sources said NEC-25 development plans include the re- entry and completion of certain existing wells and the drilling of new wells, all connected via new flow-lines and other facilities into a new offshore central processing platform. The produced natural gas is expected to be transported onshore via a new pipeline."

Sebi had asked the company to pay the penalty within 45 days to the account of &amp;quot;Sebi-Penalties Remittable to Government of India&amp;quot;. Once a subsidiary RIL, IPCL used to be a separately listed entity of the group, but was later merged with RIL and delisted from the stock exchanges. Sebi said in its order that its investigations into charges of insider trading norm violations by RPIL showed that the company was having control over IPCL as &amp;quot;promoter having control over the company with the total shareholding of approximately 46 per cent&amp;quot;. Further, RIL was shown as a 'person(s) acting in concert' with RPIL with regard to the shareholding of IPCL, Sebi said. Sebi said it conducted an investigation in the trading of the shares of IPCL during the period from February 22, 2007 to March 08, 2007. In the same case, Sebi earlier this year passed another order wherein it dropped the charges of violations of insider trading norms in IPCL shares against Manoj Modi and his wife. Modi is known as a close confidante of RIL chief Mukesh Ambani and held some senior positions at group entities in the past. Sebi said that the charges of insider trading violations could not be proved against Modi. Sebi's probe into the matter showed an irregular trading pattern in IPCL shares during the period under review, when two key announcements were made by the company -- one about an interim dividend payment and another regarding the amalgamation of IPCL with RIL. IPCL originally used to be a government-owned entity and was sold to RIL group during a disinvestment exercise. "

The pricing formula will be effective on April 1, 2014 for a period of five years, with the price to be revised quarterly using the approved formula.  The price for each quarter will be calculated based on the 12-month trailing average price with a lag of one quarter (i.e. price for April to June 2014 will be calculated based on the averages for the 12 months ended December 31, 2013).  &amp;quot;Using the approved price formula, the price effective for April 1, 2014 is estimated at around USD 8.40 per million British thermal unit, double the price of USD 4.20 for current gas sales from the D6 Block,&amp;quot; Niko said.  This price was also indicated in the Annexure that the Oil Ministry attached to the main Cabinet note on pricing of domestic gas as per a formula suggested by the Rangarajan panel.  On page 88 of the Annexure-1, the Ministry stated that the gas price based on the Petronet LNG Ltd's long-term contracts with RasGas of Qatar would come to USD 8.42 per mmBtu.  CCEA has approved inclusion of only price of only long- term LNG imports into India and has left out spot rates.  Petronet has also contracted long-term LNG from Gorgon project in Australia at higher price than RasGas and its inclusion in the formula from 2015-16 would further push up domestic rates.  &amp;quot;The pricing terms of the Petronet contracts are expected to result in further increases in the gas prices in future quarters, assuming current pricing levels of Japanese Crude Cocktail, US Henry Hub, UK National Balancing Point and Japan LNG imports,&amp;quot; Niko said.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on June 27 approved raising natural gas prices from April 2014 to an average of prevailing rates at international benchmarks and cost of imported LNG into the country. The indicative price in April is likely to be USD 8 per million British thermal unit as against USD 4.2 currently. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd, which accounts for bulk of natural gas produced in the country, will gain an additional Rs 18,100 crore (USD 3.1 billion) annually, BofA Merrill Lynch said in the report. About 65 percent of ONGC-OIL's rise in revenue from gas price hike would go to the government as higher royalty, income tax, dividend and dividend tax. &amp;quot;65 per cent of it (USD 2 billion) would go to the government. Rise in KG D6 gas price of Reliance Industries would also boost government royalty and income tax revenue by USD 200 million,&amp;quot; it said. This &amp;quot;USD 2.2 billion revenue rise from gas price hike would be used to fund rise in subsidy,&amp;quot; it said. The report said Finance Minister P Chidambaram had while announcing the CCEA decision stated that no decision has been taken on the input price of gas to user industries of power and fertiliser. &amp;quot;Although no decision on input price for consumers has been taken, subsidies may be considered for some. The investor concern, therefore, is that subsidies to gas consumers like power producers could imply lower gas price to PSU gas producers - ONGC and OIL,&amp;quot; it said. Stating that some gas consumers are already subsidised by the government, it said, &amp;quot;We believe that even in future the government would bear any rise in subsidy. In our view, the rise in government revenue (USD 2.2 billion assuming gas price goes up to USD 8) from gas price hike would fund any rise in subsidy.&amp;quot; It said if the producers were to bear the subsidy and effectively get a lower gas price then there was no incentive to invest more in exploration and production, which is the main reason for the gas price hike. Gas consumers in North East and fertiliser producers are subsidised even now. This subsidy is borne by the government and it does not mean lower gas price for ONGC/OIL.Consumers in North East pay 60 percent of prevailing gas price while OIL, the main gas producer in the region, collects balance 40 per cent of the gas price from the government. &amp;quot;The proposed gas price hike is not the first gas price hike. Gas price was hiked in 2005 and has gone up by 2.6 times in FY10-13. Subsidies went up when price hikes were made and were borne entirely by the government,&amp;quot; it added. "

The celebrations will be short-lived, for the government&rsquo;s decision to double natural gas prices from USD 4.2 per mmBtu to USD 8.4 per mmBtu from April 2014 is neither reform, nor sensible politics, nor good economics. Here's why. First, there was no tearing hurry to announce a decision for 2014 right now, when a government may change, and the entire global energy scenario may be different. Not only has the UPA tied down the next government to a seriously flawed decision, but its motives in doing so are also suspect. Second, there is no reason why pricing should be announced in dollars &ndash; when the rupee is 60 to the dollar. Remember the criticism of the Enron deal? Why price power in dollars when the revenues are all in rupee? The same logic should apply to the Indian gas pricing scene. Why should the Indian consumer, and possibly the taxpayer, take on the exchange risk of India-produced gas? Third, this is simply not reform. How can a committee- or bureaucrat-decided price be called reform? Do bureaucrats know better than the market? If the logic for allowing a price increase is that import prices are higher currently, one wonders what would happen if global prices crash? The only move that can be called reform is market-based pricing &ndash; where businesses take both the risks and rewards of global and domestic price movements. Fourth, the move is clearly anti-reform, if one goes by Finance Minister P Chidambaram's statement yesterday. He said that the government had fixed output prices and not input prices &ndash; meaning it has decided how much money gas producers, ONGC and Reliance among them, will make, but not how much gas users (power, fertiliser consumers) should pay. This is utter stupidity. Chidambaram said: &amp;quot;At the moment we are fixing only output prices, the price payable to gas producers. This will indeed have an impact on the consumer, but those prices are not being fixed today&hellip;..What is the price at which it should be supplied to a power plant, to a fertiliser plant, in order to make power affordable, fertiliser affordable&hellip; that can still be decided between now and April 1 (2014).&amp;quot; This begs the question: if input prices for power and fertiliser can be decided later, why rush to decide output prices nearly a year in advance? When the two are inter-linked, it's like trying to have your cake today, and leaving the job of cleaning up the mess to someone else in 2014. Fifth, any fixing of input at a lower price than output price will mean a bloating of subsidies. Who will pay this? The taxpayer, or somebody else? In the case of oil subsidies, both taxpayers and public sector oil companies have carried the can for the government's political decisions. Will the same happen with gas now? Will ONGC and GAIL bear the subsidies? This would be a disaster, and a clear case of misgovernance. ONGC shareholders should be suing the government if that happens. Sixth, the UPA's intentions appear suspect and mala fide. If the benefits of a gas price hike are to be had upfront (which is what the markets are celebrating) and the costs will be shifted to the next government (which will have to take the painful decision of bearing more subsidies, or reducing the gas price at the output end), this is clearly a scorched-earth policy. The UPA has essentially lobbed a ticking time-bomb to the next government. Seventh, and this could be the government's real motive, it appears that the gas price announcement was intended to achieve two non-reform goals of the UPA: given the drastic fall in the rupee, the government needed the market to perk up in order to reverse capital outflows; it also needs a buoyant stock market to meet its fiscal deficit target. These targets can be met only if public sector shares can be sold to investors. In June, foreign institutional investors sold equity and debt to the tune of over Rs 40,000 crore. The gas price announcement temporarily reversed that trend yesterday. But reform cannot be about meeting these kinds of goals. Or pandering to FIIs. Eighth, even if gas pricing is intended to induce new investments in petrocarbon exploration, it cannot be done in isolation. The energy sector comprises oil, gas, coal, coal-bed methane and shale gas, too. If you want to reform the sector, you have to reform pricing in all of them, not just gas. By raising gas prices, and leaving other prices and sectors as they are, the government is clearly worsening its energy sector problems. The only way to reform is to let prices of fuels find their own levels, so that businesses can make a rational decision on which fuel to use for what kind of output. Ninth, the doubling of gas prices is widely seen as a favour to gas producers. It may well be that, but in the long-term, it will actually damage the gas sector. When you double prices by fiat, the chances are that gas users will go into losses; they will have to be rescued either by the taxpayer or banks. And future demand for gas-based fertiliser and power plants will be curbed. Who will the gas producers sell to then? In the US, when the government decided to boost shale gas production, it did not set any price. The market did that. This brought in new investment, and competition &ndash; and today natural gas prices at the US's Henry Hub are below USD 4 per mmBtu. And here we are, trying to double that price and calling it reform. The goal of any policy should be efficiency and competition, not guaranteed profits or losses to any stakeholder. As TN Ninan askes in his weekly column in Business Standard: &amp;quot;Is any more proof needed that India's reforms, so-called, are business-friendly rather than market-friendly?&amp;quot; It is difficult to believe that the UPA's gas price move was at all intended to reform anything beyond putting out the fire in the economy's backyard &ndash; where the rupee was clearly going down in flames. Real reform is what the US did with shale gas. Sorry, Mr Chidambaram, we can't buy this.

The committee has further noted that Rangarajan panel's formula for gas pricing would be valid for five years and gas prices will be revised quarterly. The oil ministry in its final proposal had suggested to increase gas price to above USD 6.7 per mmBtu level from current USD 4.2 currently. The natural gas prices have not been increased since past three years as the oil ministry faced stiff resistance from power and fertiliser ministry. Following gas price hike fuel cost of gas based power plant is likely to double and average power cost is seen rising by 16 paise per kwh.  The Rangarajan formula uses long-term and spot liquid gas (LNG) import contracts as well as international trading benchmarks to arrive at a competitive price for India. While the Rangarajan panel had recommended revising domestic gas prices every month based, the Oil Ministry changed it to a quarterly revision.  Though the average of the two currently comes to USD 6.775, the price of gas in April next year when these guidelines will come into effect would be around USD 8.42 and over USD 10 in the following year. This is because Petronet's deal with Qatar's RasGas (India's only functional long-term LNG contract) has a price-cap which lifts in January 2014, linking gas prices fully with crude. &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;"

In a note to clients,&amp;amp;nbsp;brokerage house CLSA&amp;amp;nbsp;has analysed the likely impact of the move on the earnings of oil &amp;amp;amp; gas majors.Excerpts from the report: Reliance Industries: This price hike will make the FY15 EPS growth of 19 percent more believable and could take the stock near our target of Rs 930/share, which nearly corresponds to its historical average PE of 11.8 times. More importantly, this gas price hike should make some of Reliance&rsquo;s discoveries commercial and accelerate approvals for developing nearly 4 TCF(trillion cubic feet) of discoveries. q At the same time, this should also incentivise Reliance to carry production improvement programmes in its producing fields in D6. ONGC, OIL: Unlike Reliance, ONGC and Oil India are not neat beneficiaries of this price hike as the government may choose to take back a part of this benefit by increasing subsidy burden of these companies. Nonetheless, even under an oppressive scenario of continuation of FY12/13 subsidyformula of USD56/bbl subsidy on liquid production, we expect ONGC/OIL's fairvalue to settle 6/4% higher than the current market price. GAIL: A price hike to USD 8/mmbtu gas used as feedstock for LPG and petchem production by GAIL lower its EPS by Rs 9.4 (31%) and fair value to Rs 295/share. In our opinion, Gail bears subsidy on LPG production on the logic that it benefits from using controlled price gas as input. Therefore, a sharp hike in gas price makes a strong case for Gail to be exempted from subsidy burden which could boost fair value to Rs 445/sh (+49%) and this could be a blessing in disguise for Gail. Any increase in gas production outlook should be a boost for Gail's core gas transmission business, which has been impacted by four years of decline.

They expect a 9 to 11% upside to ONGC and Oil India's FY15 EPS estimates, if gas price does rise to over 8 dollars.  GAIL Brokerage: NomuraRating: NEUTRAL Rationale: GAIL as a user of gas would be the worst impacted by the gas price hike. The pricing of both LPG and Petchem is based on import parity, thus GAIL may not be able to pass on costs.&amp;amp;nbsp;GAIL's gas cost could increase by USD 180 million.JSW Energy Brokerage: NomuraRating: BUYTarget: Rs 54Rationale: The recent rupee depreciation does dent earnings, but the hit is mitigated by weaker thermal prices.

Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman, Feedback Infrastructure expects the government to hike the prices of gas in the range of USD 6.5-8.5/ mmbtu.  Additionally, Chatterjee says once the gas price increases will lead to an increase in the domestic supply. &amp;quot;That is certainly an expectation in the market that there will be an increase in output and availability from domestic sources,&amp;quot; says Chatterjee in an interview to CNBC-TV18. Today&rsquo;s meeting will be eyed by big power players as the earlier proposal was only to hike ONGC and Oil India&rsquo;s administered price mechanism (APM) gas price but was later changed to new gas price regime for all players. The changes will come in effect from April 1, 2014. Below is the edited transcript of Chatterjee&rsquo;s interview to CNBC-TV18.  Q: Put this whole gas price hike business in perspective for us, what it does to the power sector, what it eventually does to the gas availability issue in India and how significant it is or could be from a macro perspective? A: It is a tangled web and I believe the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) along with the empowered group is going to be deliberating and hopefully taking a decision on gas price either today or tomorrow, possibly today.  The spectrum of expectations range from USD 13 per unit as per the presentation made by a group of private sector honchos to the Prime Minister (PM) justifying it on the basis of linkage to petroleum prices, to as low as some people saying that the current price is at USD 4.2/mmbtu is as good as it gets because the long-term well-head prices from Qatar, Malaysia etc are at those prices.  Then, there is a USD 6.6/mmbtu point which has been crystallized around the power ministry and there is an USD 8.4/mmbtu, which has been crystalised around the Rangarajan Committee report. So, my guess is you are probably going to see a decision somewhere between USD 6.5/mmbtu and USD 8.5/mmbtu and both these extremes are within the realm of possibility. The question then is that what happens to availability. The expectation on gas is that any increase in the price now, will hopefully see an increase in domestic supply. That is certainly an expectation in the market that there will be an increase in output and availability from domestic sources. Also, the US Secretary of State, John Kerry&rsquo;s visit to India has taken the discussion forward on US allowing India to import energy, which right now is banned because India is not an free trade agreement (FTA) country, it is not a country that is signatory to the FTA with USA. And USA only approves export of gas including shale gas to FTA approved countries. But we hear that this provision maybe relaxed or may have already been relaxed. This announcement will possibly happen when the Vice President of USA visits us later in the year. We have got the expectation of domestic gas availability rising. We have got expectations of US gas coming in. The real issue is finally that even if this gas is made available at this price to power generating plants, then the question is the end price. The end price of gas produced power could be anywhere from Rs 6.5-7/unit upto Rs 10/unit depending on various issues of costing, logistics, supply etc. In the absence of a peaking power policy and in the absence of any policy that mandates distribution companies (DISCOMs) to buy gas as a source of energy diversification and clean energy, in a situation today where DISCOMs are not even buying thermal power at higher rates because of their fear of increasing their losses and their resorting to load shedding, the big question is that assuming there is a positive answer today from the cabinet on a gas price increase and these other perspectives falling to place, what will happen to gas plants that produced power. The two requirements are some kind of a purchase obligation by the DISCOMs, maybe a huge degree of lifting by the government buying agencies and peaking policy along with an obligation. The other development in the market that is gathering momentum is the fact that many customers who are today buying at tariffs which are set by the regulators have a propensity to pay higher.  States like Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have already given dispensations to say that if there is a willing buyer at a higher price and a willing seller particularly in gas based selling plants in Andhra Pradesh -- the regulator has given a dispensation -- then they allow these two parties to mutually interact and set a price.  If this movement cascades across the country, we have a huge number of customers from malls to factories to institutions which are running their facilities on digisets which probably costs Rs 15 a unit.  _PAGEBREAK_ So, if this facility of &ndash; assuming that the power obligation and peaking power policy, etc take time, even if the government moves ahead allowing willing buyer and a willing seller to negotiate a higher tariff that reduces genset uses, then there is significant hope for gas based power. Q: Are you confident that this decision will come through today, there have been numerous postponements of this meeting, is it your sense that the government is stepping on the panic pedal with respect to policy and they have all these ministry power, fertiliser etc on board with their decision because that is what is of urgent need right now, to move with this fast? A: My information is that there is a reasonable degree of convergence that has happened outside between the ministers, between people who are empowered to take their decisions. I think a political and administrative convergence has already happened so I am reasonably optimistic that today we are going to get the decision.Q: Let me turn the question around from the power side to the gas side, is it your understanding that a price hike to 6.6 going up to 7.5-8 over the next couple of years is good enough for private gas players to start exploration or become far more aggressive in trying to ramp up their gas production? A: I do not think I am qualified to answer that question because the gas production is a combination both of commercial pricing as well as of technical difficulties in extraction. How the two will play out, we will leave it to the players who are operationally involved. This spectrum is so wide that at one level, you have a group of private sector operators including multinational investors in India who can make a strong case to say that gas prices should be linked to international fuel prices. One of the indicators for Asia is the Japanese Crude Cocktail (JCC) and if one takes that, then there is a logical reason to say that USD 13 per unit is a fair price. That is one end of the spectrum. At the other end of the spectrum, if one takes a different point of view which says that linking gas prices to international commodity markets which are manipulated by commodity traders, hedge funds etc is no real medium-term or long-term index of what a price of a natural resource should be.  Hence, the right way to do it is to see what are the long-term contracts from countries that produce gas, from say whom India imports, like Malaysia, Qatar etc. This group will make a point to say that the existing price of USD 4.2 per unit is a fair price so, why even increase that. Then in between there are other arguments.  There is a group that feels USD 4.2 per unit is a decent price based on this bundle of logic, well-head prices of neighbouring countries and there is another group that says the best thing is link it to international petroleum and liquid fuel prices, use JCC and then one gets a price of USD 13 per unit.  So, the theoretical argument is a very interesting one because one can take a position between USD 4 and 13 and in any case there is the Dr Rangarajan Committee in India which officially has submitted its report and says at this point of time, the right price is USD 8.4.  Hence, it is really a tricky issue for the government but with this perspective, the possibility that a political administrative decision that tries to marry different points of view would certainly swing between USD 6.4 and 8.4 per unit. Somewhere in this range, one will get the decision. The issue is skating on thin ice because whatever is done, the government is subject to criticism but at the same time it has to go ahead and give a decision. Q: The expectation also is that once this gas pricing issue is announced, the government is going to follow that up with fairly aggressive price increases both on fuels like petrol and diesel but also prickly issues like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), are you getting that sense that the government is willing to bite the bullet on all these oil pricing issues and increase prices in a dramatic fashion because of what has happened globally as also with the currency? A: The signal that the government is already in a mood to align energy prices in steps to international prices is something that Montek Singh Ahluwalia has been saying for a long time. Whatever we are going to see is a journey where month-by-month or once in two months, there will be a series of incremental increases.  For example, 19 states have increased their tariffs by anywhere from 19 percent to 40 percent, Uttar Pradesh (UP) has just increased by 40 percent. So, even a 40 percent increase in power and in UP it is not just industrial, this 40 percent is to agricultural users and domestic users. So, one is seeing consumers of both domestic power as well as petrol and diesel getting aligned to an economic format which leads them to expect a certain rise few times a year. So, the gradualism or incremental increase to a targeted goal is the way. Indian policymakers will take us down that road."

Also read: RComm, Reliance Jio to ink intra-city fiber pact soon In a country where most people own a mobile phone yet lack basic Internet access, it is a risky gamble even for India's richest man. He is counting on an unproven strategy and still-developing technology in a market with very little pricing power. Three years ago energy conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) won an exclusive nationwide licence to roll out 4G across India, giving it a foothold to tap a potentially lucrative market in phones, tablets, computers and television. The data-focused service could start to roll-out in New Delhi and Mumbai by the end of the year, sources familiar with the matter, who asked not be named, told Reuters. Eventually, the plan is to run it across hundreds of cities. Ambani has refused to divulge any specifics on the launch. In what is one of the world's poorest countries, Ambani's 4G mantra is affordability. This has fuelled industry worries of a price war in a still-crowded telecoms sector that has recently started seeing stability after years of cut-throat competition and regulatory uncertainty. Ambani's strategy is cut-price handsets and data, even if it means he has to subsidise the devices from his own cash pile. Fortunately, he has very deep pockets. Reliance's cash hoard of &amp;amp;#36;15 billion stands in contrast to rival telecoms carriers who are estimated to have a combined debt load of &amp;amp;#36;32 billion. &amp;quot;Broadband and digital services will no longer be a luxury item - a scarce commodity - to be rationed amongst the privileged few,&amp;quot; Ambani, the world's 22nd richest person according to Forbes magazine, told shareholders this month. Ambani hopes to offer 4G devices costing less than Rs 5,000 and in talks with Samsung Electronics Co and others for sourcing handsets and other devices, one of the sources said. A spokeswoman at Samsung's local unit declined to comment. While it appears to be a risky bet, the payoff for a successful venture is first-mover advantage in mobile data communications, which has transformed media, marketing and business strategies from Europe and the United States to China. In a sign that its rollout is gaining pace, Ambani's Reliance Jio Infocomm unit this month signed a USD 2 billion telecom tower sharing deal with mobile carrier Reliance Communications, which is owned by his younger brother Anil. That followed an agreement with rival Bharti Airtel for leasing international bandwidth, and two other pacts. India's cellular market is the world's second largest by users after China, with users surging from just over 5 million in 2002 to nearly 870 million now. However, less than 5 percent of mobile phone owners use their device for high speed 3G data. The uptake for 3G has been slower than expected since its launch in 2011 after costly airwave auctions, mainly due to the premium pricing of data services in a country where voice rates are less than 1 US cent a minute, among the lowest anywhere. Cheap data rates could help grow usage of 4G, which offers several times faster download speeds, but would force Ambani to play an expensive mass volume game - a bruising strategy that has battered margins for India's incumbent mobile carriers. Over the next five years as infrastructure is built, analysts predict India's rapidly growing middle class will buy between 30-80 million 4G connections. Some investors, however, are worried Reliance may be taking too much of a gamble in its bid to diversify away from its oil and gas-related business which produces the bulk of its USD 70 billion in revenues. They are also growing impatient over an outlay that has cost nearly USD 5 billion and counting, with no returns expected anytime soon. Challenges ahead Serious technology challenges await Reliance. The company is using a version of 4G that is still evolving, and there are few compatible network devices and handsets now available. Bharti, which has 4G permits for some service areas, launched its first network more than a year ago, but is yet to start selling a handset that works on the technology. The 2300 megahertz spectrum band India has allotted for 4G is less efficient than the 700 megahertz band widely used in the West. Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad and Samsung's popular Galaxy S4 are not tuned for RIL's spectrum. The 700 band is currently allocated for state TV broadcasting services and security agencies, but the sector watchdog has recommended that the band be auctioned in 2014. Both bands need the same core infrastructure, making the switch from one to the other possible. Ambani's telecoms ambitions have a familiar ring - a decade ago a phone company run by him sharply cut call prices and sold handsets for an initial payment of just USD 10. It transformed an industry that came to symbolise India's rampant economic growth. His re-entry raises the possibility of another price war in a sector where carriers including Bharti and Vodafone have only recently started seeing price stability. &amp;quot;It's a very competitive market, and Reliance looks to be very serious and aggressive,&amp;quot; said Walter Rossini, a Milan-based fund manager at Aletti Gestielle SGR, which counts Reliance and Bharti among its Indian holdings. But many question Reliance's dependence on a data-focused network in a market where voice generates nearly 85 percent of carrier revenues. &amp;quot;Though we think RIL's entry into the telecom space cannot be ignored, we believe that for RIL to pose any credible threat to incumbents, a strong comprehensive voice business is an imperative,&amp;quot; Macquarie analysts wrote in a note on June 7. Reliance received a boost when India recently allowed 4G carriers to offer voice services by paying an extra fee. It is yet to decide whether to offer voice on its 4G airwaves using new technology or by tying up with an established voice carrier, a company source said. Reliance did not reply to emailed questions seeking comments on its 4G plans. While acknowledging scepticism towards his 4G venture, Ambani said at the shareholders meeting this month he was in the &amp;quot;optimistic minority&amp;quot; who held a bullish view of the sector. Executives at rival carriers play down the Reliance threat. &amp;quot;For them it is everything starting from scratch and we have a very serious headstart in this business,&amp;quot; said an official at a large rival telecoms carrier, declining to be named."

Dasgupta, who had previously alleged that Moily was favouring RIL by proposing a steep increase in gas prices, said the company is producing under 15 million standard cubic metres per day of gas against its own stated target of 80. Lower production, which was because RIL refused to drill wells it had committed when it got KG-D6 gas field capex hiked to USD 8.8 billion from USD 2.4 billion, had led to loss of 13,600 MW of electricity generation and 325 lakh tonnes of urea production, he told a press conference here.  While his predecessor S Jaipal Reddy had fined RIL over USD 1 billion for missing 2011-12 output target by 60 per cent, Moily has not initiated any such action for larger variation in subsequent 2012-13 and current fiscal, he said. &amp;quot;The same principle needs to be scrupulously applied for both 2012-13 and the current year as well,&amp;quot; he said reading out a letter he today wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the subject.  The government, he said, needs to disallow USD 1.7 billion of RIL's investment for production failing to meet target in 2012-13 and USD 3 billion for current year. &amp;quot;The Petroleum Minister (Moily) talks about giving incentives for (raising) production. What about disincentives for shortfall in production,&amp;quot; he said.  In the letter to Prime Minister, the Left leader said the UPA government believed only in giving &amp;quot;carrots to the corporates (but) there are no sticks to set them right when they indulge in wilful wrong doing.&amp;quot; Dasgupta said output lagging targets meant Rs 110,000 crore loss due to shortfall in power generation and urea production.  RIL had disputed the penalty imposed by Reddy and an arbitration initiated but since Moily took over the arbitration has been stalled, he alleged. &amp;quot;Can a Petroleum Minister decide unilaterally to thwart the arbitration proceedings to absolve a single corporate of its multi-billion contractual obligations,&amp;quot; he said. He alleged that output was kept deliberately low in therun-up to price revision due in April 2014.  Moily has proposed raising gas prices in the immediate to USD 6.7 per million British thermal unit from USD 4.2 and to USD 8-10 next year. &amp;quot;The arm-twisting policy of RIL is revealed, the fall in production (from KG basin) is synonymous with high demand,&amp;quot; he said adding that RIL has defrauded the country and it is still being pampered by the government.

He said a decision on the matter will not be taken on mere technicality of rules and it would be taken keeping the energy security of the country in mind. &amp;quot;Automatically, technically applying rule is good for you (but) it is not good for the country,&amp;quot; he said without elaborating. Moily wants the country to explore aggressively so that more oil and gas is produced which will help cut the massive USD 160 billion foreign exchange outflow every year for buying oil. Rejecting RIL's offer to relinquish 4,233 sq km of &amp;quot;low prospectivity area&amp;quot; in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, the DGH had stated that the company should contractually give up 6,601 sq km out of the total 7,645 sq km total area in the block. In a 6-page note, Director General of Hydrocarbons R N Choubey on April 15 wrote to Oil Secretary Vivek Rae that of the 19 oil and gas discoveries claimed by RIL, three finds have not been established as commercially viable in absence of test data and the company has not submitted any investment plans for another five. He noted that the area proposed for cessation has at least 1.15 trillion cubic feet of known recoverable gas reserves valued at USD 4.83 billion at current prices. Asked about his ministry calling for applications for appointing a new DGH, Moily said he wants the technical arm of the ministry to be manned by a technocrat and not an IAS. &amp;quot;I want a technical man (at DGH). For last one or two years, we (have) continued with a non-technical man. It is not good (and) you don't get correct objective opinion,&amp;quot; he said. Choubey, a 1981 batch IAS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, was appointed DGH in June last year when S Jaipal Reddy was the Petroleum Minister. Moily took over in November last year. Moily said the new DGH will be selected from those who applied at close of application on May 31, by a panel comprising of secretaries headed by Oil Secretary Vivek Rae. The panel comprises Secretary to Department of Personnel and Training and Science and Technology Secretary, he said. To prevent companies from hoarding exploration acreage, they are contractually required to relinquish 25 percent area at the end of three years, 50 percent after another two years and are allowed to retain only areas where discovery is made after a total of seven years. RIL and its partner Niko Resources of Canada were awarded the KG-D6 block in 2000. The three-year Phase-1 ended on June 7, 2003 while the 2-year Phase-II expired on June 7, 2005. The third phase ended on June 7, 2007. Sources said DGH in 2006 agreed to RIL proposal of declaring the entire 7,645 sq km as discovery area, thereby allowing the company to retain the full area. The decision was ratified by a committee headed by Additional Secretary in the Ministry and by the Oil Minister thereafter. But the decision was questioned by government auditor CAG as at the end of the third phase, only 79 percent of the block area was covered by 3D seismic survey and yet the entire area was declared a discovery area. CAG, in its performance audit in 2011, had asked the Ministry to review determination of entire contract area of KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) as 'discovery area'. KG-D6 output has dipped from 69.43 million standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) achieved in March 2010, to under 15 mmscmd this month."

RIL counsel Janak Dwarakadas informed the SAT presiding officer Jog Singh that they could not file the reply as the company's appointed person could not prepare the papers as his father was hospitalised. The Sebi counsel noted that the continuous adjournments that the company is seeking will further delay the ongoing adjudication process into the case. The matter was last heard by SAT on February 21, when the tribunal sought time to study the application, which Sebi terms as &amp;quot;not maintainable&amp;quot;. Since then RIL has been seeking adjournment. The case was then adjourned in March, April and May and today as well. The Tribunal head told the RIL counsel that before the next hearing, slated for July 22 and which will be the final hearing, the company should file its response, failing which it would not entertain the reply. The case relates to RIL's appeal against the market regulator in a case related to alleged violation of insider trading norms in sale of shares of its erstwhile subsidiary RPL in 2007. RIL had approached SAT against Sebi after its application to settle the matter through a 'consent mechanism' was rejected by the regulator. Under Sebi's consent mechanism, companies can seek to settle cases with the market regulator after payment of certain charges and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. RIL has challenged Sebi's decision and also the recent changes made by the regulator in regulations governing settlement of cases through the consent mechanism, especially those already under consideration. In May 2012, Sebi had tightened the norms for settlement through consent framework. As a result, many cases, including those related to insider trading, are not being settled through this mechanism. On January 3 this year, the Sebi had published a list of 149 consent pleas, including 16 from entities related to RIL group, which it had found unsuitable for settlement through consent process. These include applications of RIL itself and that of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani's close aide Manoj Modi."

Even in shale gas division, the firm has reported an EBITDA of USD 483 million in FY13 which is quite low compared to the cumulative investment of around USD 5.7 billion. RIL shale gas and related hydrocarbon volumes have shown robust growth and this will likely continue for the next few years. However, large invested capital along with additional capex requirements for drilling incremental wells may prelude meaningful value creation unless gas prices sustain at higher levels.

On completion of clearance process, exploration blocks are likely to be offered in 2013-14,&amp;quot; he said while addressing a meeting of the Parliamentary consultative committee in Mussoorie. While Moily did not indicate the number of blocks to be offered, officials said as many as 68 blocks or areas for exploration of oil and gas may be auctioned. This will be the second-highest offering of block since the advent of NELP 1999. Of the blocks being considered for offering in NELP-X, 25 are deep-water, 20 shallow-water and 23 onland blocks. The government has in previous nine rounds awarded 254 blocks for exploration of oil and gas. Last few rounds received tepid response with global majors staying away. Of the 34 areas offered in NELP-IX in 2010, bids were received for 33 blocks at the close of bidding on March 28, 2011. Of these, only 19 blocks were awarded. Moily said crude oil production in current fiscal is likely to rise to 39.396 million tonne (MT) in current fiscal from 37.762 MT in the last. Nearly 31 percent of last year's output came from private firms like Cairn India. Natural gas production on the other hand is expected to decline to 105 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in 2013-14 from 111.4 mmscmd in the previous fiscal, he said. The main reason for the dip is lower output from Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 field. &amp;quot;With the fresh investments in E and P sector, natural gas production is likely to further rise by end of 12th Five-Year Plan,&amp;quot; Moily said. NELP-VIII was the largest round with 70 blocks being offered. But only 32 blocks could be awarded. In NELP-VII, 41 blocks out of the 57 areas offered were awarded while NELP-VI was by far the most successful round with 52 out of 55 blocks on offer finding bidders. The first five bid rounds saw award of 107 blocks. India has an estimated sedimentary area of 3.14 million sqkms, comprising 26 sedimentary basins. At present, an area of 0.93 million sqkm area is held under exploration and production in 19 basins. &amp;quot;As of now, 73 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas could be established through exploration, out of 205 billion barrels of prognosticated hydrocarbon resources. Thus, about 133 billion barrels of prognosticated resources remain to be unlocked through exploration,&amp;quot; he said. "

RIL has shut half of the 18 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 field due to high water and sand ingress and a third of 6 wells on MA field due to the same reason. The report said D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields produced 11.05 mmscmd of gas while the rest came from MA field. Output at D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 field has dropped from 12.35 mmscmd in March and 11.85 mmscmd in April.

Besides the fall in output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, gas production from MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, too has dropped. The report said of the 14.83 mmscmd of gas production from KG-D6, 14.34 mmscmd was sold to urea manufacturing fertiliser plants. No sale was made to power plants. The remaining 0.49 mmscmd was consumed by LPG manufacturing plants and the pipeline that transports the KG-D6 gas, it said. RIL, the report said, has projected an output of 14.50 mmscmd last week of May. The company has so far made 18 gas and one oil discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin block in Bay of Bengal. While the lone oil find, MA went on stream in September 2008, largest among the gas finds, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 were put on production in April, 2009. "

It is a statement that has had timeless relevance. Unfortunately, it seems to losing some of that pertinence among heads of Corporate India. How else does one explain the disproportionate amount of time spent by these owner-executives on their IPL teams?",,"Business, Forbes, GMR Infra, India Cements, IPL, United Spirits",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ceos-how-about-switching-focusipl-back-to-business_884029.html,"Vishal BhargavaAchelous Advantage The fact that IPL is a scandal is not new. The tricks being played around would make even Al Capone smile. But that would be irrelevant if the companies owning these teams were private bodies not answerable to anyone except itself.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; First, let's examine the scope of the IPL with regards to its potential benefit for the owners. Valuation of any enterprise is tricky business. In the case of valuation of sporting teams, the task becomes even tougher. But let's try to simplify it.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Major football clubs have now seen valuations like any other commercial entity. Real Madrid, the most valuable soccer team in the world, is valued at USD 3.3 billion according to Forbes. The club generates an operating income of USD134 million. This implies a current price-to-earnings (where earnings are operating income) ratio of 25x - not the multiple that will make an investor grovel.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; It gets trickier when one is looking at baseball clubs in the US. New York Yankees, the highest valued club by some distance, are touted to have a valuation of USD 2.3 billion while operating income is a measly USD 1.4 million. L.A Dodgers are assessed at a valuation of USD 1.6 billion and operating income is USD 3.2 million. Besides these two clubs, there is sanity in the valuation of other baseball clubs ranging between 25x-30x.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; So - what is the scope when it comes to IPL? Executives of almost all franchisees concede they are in a loss or at best have just about broken even. The two key sources of revenue are fixed for franchisees - broadcasting and central sponsors. These two sources provide close to Rs 70-75 cr in revenues for the franchisees. It is the other sources that differentiate the profitability levels. These comprise primarily local sponsors, stadium sales and merchandise revenues. Local sponsors add up between Rs 20-30 cr in revenues. The two main expenses for the teams is the annual franchisee cost (bid amount that is to be paid annually for 10 years) and player expense. For a team like Mumbai Indians and RCB, these costs equal over Rs 100 cr. Besides these expenses, there are travel &amp;amp;amp; hotel expenses and marketing costs. Even with the assumption of reasonable stadium ticket profits (sales minus rent) and merchandise profits - profits are always likely to be minimal from the entire venture. If anything, with the continuous scandals engulfing the IPL - the biggest sources of revenues, broadcasting and sponsorship revenues may actually come down.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Commentators claim the brand also contributes to the overall valuation for a team. Given the subjectivity associated with brand valuation it is tough to make a realistic estimate of it. Already, cynics point out that there is brand dilution with teams associated with the IPL.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, the stocks of the companies associated with the IPL are languishing over a 5-yr period.

The only one that has risen and risen significantly is United Spirits. Perhaps, they can take a cue from United Spirits which has seen a massive gain after Vijay Mallya exited some part of its stake and gave it to a more competent entity (Diageo) to run. Others should follow suit, exit the IPL and focus on the business that shareholders expected them to manage in the first place.

Also Read:FM should not rob oil companies to show a lower deficit  The well was drilled two kilometres below the existing producing D1 and D3 fields. &amp;quot;The KGD6-MJ1 well was drilled in a water depth of 1,024 metres - and to a total depth of 4,509 metres (4.5 kilometres below seabed),&amp;quot; RIL-BP said in a statement. The well was drilled to explore the prospectivity of a Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir lying over 2,000 metres below the already producing reservoirs in the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields. &amp;quot;Formation evaluation indicates a gross gas and condensate column in the well of about 155 metres in the Mesozoic reservoirs,&amp;quot; the statement said adding the well flowed 30.6 million standard cubic feet per day of gas during testing. Though RIL-BP did not put any reserves to the discovery, the find may possibly be the largest single discovery in the country. The discovery, which was notified to the regulatory authorities this afternoon, has been named D-55. Sources said the resource found may be significantly more than a pre-drill best case gross prospective resource of 819 billion cubic feet of gas and 56 million barrels of liquids for the well. RIL-BP had drilled MJ-1 well in early March after the government permitted companies to drill exploration wells in areas where exploration period had long expired. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields, the largest among the 18 gas finds on KG-D6 block, have proved to be more difficult to produce than previously predicted. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 reservoir has seen sharper-than-expected drop in pressure and water and sand ingress in production wells, leading to a drop in output."

Moily thrashed CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta's allegations of favouring RIL as &amp;quot;totally false and baseless&amp;quot; and said the proposed increase in natural gas price was being done &amp;quot;strictly in line with the formula proposed by Prime Minister appointed panel headed by his economic adviser C Rangarajan.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is totally false and baseless. The new pricing, if approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), will apply to all gas produced in the country. Two-thirds of the gas produced in the country is by public sector companies (like ONGC) and the new pricing will apply equally to them and they stand to benefit more out of it,&amp;quot; he said. In a point-by-point rebuttal to allegations made by Dasgupta at a press conference on Thursday, Moily said the CPI leader &amp;quot;was wrong in saying that the petroleum ministry has deviated from the recommendations of Rangarajan Committee&amp;quot;. The allegations of a gigantic scam in making &amp;quot;are not only devoid of merits but also are malicious and based on distorted facts&amp;quot;. The price revision besides being contractual requirement, was needed to spur investment in oil and gas exploration which has stagnated over past few years, he said. Gas finds in deep-sea are not economically viable to develop at current rate of USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit. &amp;quot;Dasgupta talks of fertiliser subsidy rising due to gas price increase but what he does not realise is that if domestic production does not increase, we will have to import gas and imported gas (LNG) costs triple the domestic gas price,&amp;quot; Moily said. The government stands to gain from rise in domestic gas price by way of increased royalty, profit petroleum as well as taxes which can be used to make up for increased subsidy. Moily was attending an oil and gas conference in Bangkok when Dasgupta made the allegations at a press conference yesterday at New Delhi. &amp;quot;What Dasgupta is saying is totally baseless and incorrect. He may be ill-informed about facts,&amp;quot; Moily said, adding that the Rangarajan Committee was appointed by Prime Minister on a request from Moily's predecessor S Jaipal Reddy. The panel suggested pricing all domestically produced conventional and non-conventional gas at a mix of international hub prices and actual cost of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The price as per this formula came to USD 8, but in the note to CCEA, the oil ministry modified it to bring it down to USD 6.775 per mmBtu. &amp;quot;Spreading false information will scare away investors,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We need technology and investment to explore and produce more domestically so as to cut reliance on imports.&amp;quot; Moily said the Rangarajan panel formula has to be approved by the CCEA and views of the other ministries and Planning Commission shall be placed before the Cabinet for consideration. &amp;quot;The proposed pricing guidelines shall be equally applicable to both the private and public sector companies. It may also be highlighted that more than 60 per cent of the natural gas in India is still produced by the public sector companies. Therefore, the allegation that the price is being revised for the benefit of the private sector is completely misconceived,&amp;quot; a statement issued by the Ministry said. Moily also refuted Dasgupta's allegation that oil secretary Vivek Rae was not on the same page on gas price revision. &amp;quot;There is no question of Secretary opposing (gas price revision). We are only forwarding Rangarajan panel recommendations to the Cabinet.&amp;quot; Use of imported gas would result in 2 to 3 times higher subsidy outgo for fertiliser and power."

Ranged on one side, either covertly or overtly, are Reliance Industries, ONGC and other state-run oil and gas companies; on the other side are gas users &ndash; primarily the fertiliser and power companies. And then there are the warring ministries &ndash; oil, finance, fertilisers and power &ndash; battling on both sides. Under pressure from the gas producing companies, the UPA government set up the Rangarajan Committee which came up with a formula that would double gas prices from the current USD 4.2 per mmBtu (million metric British thermal units) to nearly USD 8.8 per mmBtu. Rangarajan&rsquo;s pricing was based on averaging traded prices at some global hubs, including the US's Henry Hub and the UK's National Balancing Point (NBP), among other things. It suggested that gas prices should be changed monthly based on its formula. There is already a godawful row on this recommendation. While Reliance and British Petroleum were unhappy with even this price, the power and fertiliser companies threw a fit, and the oil ministry went into another balancing act. Recently it came up with a cabinet note recommending a price of USD 6.8 per mmBtu, to be fixed quarterly. This price is midway between the current price and what Rangarajan recommended, indicating that the oil ministry is trying for a compromise. Business Standard, in an editorial today, suggests that gas should be priced based on the calorific value of imported coal &ndash; which would bring the price down to around USD5.5 per mmBtu. The newspaper notes: &ldquo;It bears repeating that gas pricing is highly contingent on variables that are specific to particular markets. Yet there are some broad facts about the Asian gas market that are relevant &ndash; for example, that liquid natural gas from the US is considered to become uneconomical in Asia when the price at the US&rsquo; Henry Hub is over USD6 per mmBtu.&rdquo; In India&rsquo;s case, the paper argues that gas prices need to be linked to Indonesian coal import prices. &ldquo;Given that India is a coal-dependent country and its coal import needs are rising rapidly, should it not use some form of coal equivalent pricing?&rdquo; The problem with all these formulae &ndash; whether it is the Rangarajan one or the oil ministry&rsquo;s mash-up or someone else&rsquo;s &ndash; is that they ignore a more fundamental point: why should the government at all be trying to decide this? If gas, coal and other forms of energy operate in a free market, prices will vary depending on local factors, including demand-supply balance, import-export duties, availability of comparable fuels, and transport economics. When governments try to fix prices, there is a 99 percent chance that they will get it wrong. The only solution to the issue of gas pricing is to let commercial entities &ndash; whether it is power or fertiliser plants, or even domestic and industrial gas distribution companies &ndash; float global tenders for long-term supplies to meet base demand and top this up with spot purchases when they face sudden spikes in short-term demand. It is not possible for babus sitting in Delhi to decide what is the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; price for gas. There is no right price for gas. There are various prices, and users have to decide if these work for them or not. In fact, even market pricing will not work for gas unless substitute fuels &ndash; oil, coal-bed methane, And coal, among other fuels &ndash; are also free to find their own levels. Trying to decide long-term gas prices with the help of IAS officials and former Reserve Bank Governors is like trying to predict next year&rsquo;s monsoon by looking at the skies this week. It&rsquo;s no different from astrology. It is time to abandon gas pricing by committee and political cabal, prodded by interested businessmen. The markets will get it right much better than all of them put together. Evidence: the US managed to get gas prices down to USD 4 merely by encouraging shale gas entrepreneurship and letting the markets do the rest. It is unlikely that grey eminences such as Rangarajan and politicians such as Veerappy Moily can work prices out better than the market.

Also, pressure decline was several times higher than originally envisaged and early water production in some of the wells was not predicted in the initial reservoir simulations, though overall field water production is small, she said. To a separate question, Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily said RIL has been asked to drill more wells and undertake remedial measures to revive the sick wells. Besides, the company's proposal to install compressor at onshore terminal to increase gas recovery from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 has been approved, he said adding that the development plan for another four satellite gas fields has also been approved."

Pronouncing Reliance Petroinvestments Ltd (RPIL) guilty of violating the insider trading regulations with regard to its dealings in shares of Indian Petrochemicals Corp Ltd (IPCL) in early 2007, SEBI said that RPIL made profits of over Rs 3.82 crore through these trades. After taking into account the quantum and nature of the violations, SEBI decided to impose a penalty of Rs 11 crore on RPIL, which was listed as one of the promoter entities by IPCL itself in its regulatory filings as on March 31, 2006, the regulator said in its 17-page late night order. The regulator said the penalty needs to be paid within 45 days to the account of &amp;quot;SEBI-Penalties Remittable to Government of India&amp;quot;. Once a subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), IPCL used to be a separately listed entity of the group, but was later merged with RIL and delisted from the stock exchanges. SEBI said in its order that its investigations into charges of insider trading norm violations by RPIL showed that the company was having control over IPCL as &amp;quot;promoter having control over the company with the total shareholding of approximately 46 percent&amp;quot;. Further, RIL was shown as a 'person(s) acting in concert' with RPIL with regard to the shareholding of IPCL, SEBI said. SEBI said it conducted an investigation in the trading of the shares of IPCL during the period from February 22, 2007 to March 08, 2007. In the same case, SEBI recently passed another order wherein it dropped the charges of violations of insider trading norms in IPCL shares against Manoj Modi and his wife. Modi is known as a close confidante of RIL chief Mukesh Ambani and held some senior positions at group entities in the past. But, SEBI said that the charges of insider trading violations could not be proved against Modi. SEBI's probe into the matter showed an irregular trading pattern in IPCL shares during the period under review, when two key announcements were made by the company -- one about an interim dividend payment and another regarding the amalgamation of IPCL with RIL. IPCL originally used to be a government-owned entity and was sold to RIL group during a disinvestment exercise. SEBI found that RPIL has violated the Prohibition of Insider Trading norms through its dealings in these shares while being in possession of &amp;quot;unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) while trading in the scrip of IPCL prior to announcement of declaration of interim dividend and amalgamation of IPCL with RIL&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;It is observed from the Investigation Report that RPIL received a dividend of approximately Rs 1.28 crore and made a notional profit of approximately Rs 2.54 crore (difference between acquisition cost of IPCL shares and market price of RIL shares on dealing dates based on average price). &amp;quot;Thus, the Noticee made a profit of approximately Rs 2.83 crore when in possession of UPSI relating to declaration of interim dividend and amalgamation of IPCL with RIL.&amp;quot; During the course of its inquiry, SEBI served a Show Cause Notice in January 2011, wherein RPIL and RIL were termed as 'insiders' on the basis of the shareholding patterns submitted by IPCL itself about their promoters and related entities. Besides, Mukesh Ambani was Chairman of IPCL, as well as Chairman and MD of RIL during the period under review, thus putting both the companies under same management, while RPIL held more than one-third of total voting power of IPCL at that time. Also, RIL held the entire share capital of RPIL through two wholly owned subsidiaries. _PAGEBREAK_ It was also stated in the show-cause notice that &amp;quot;RPIL was conceived by the management of RIL for the sole purpose of acquiring shares at the time of disinvestment by the Government in favour of RIL. &amp;quot;Further, it is observed that during the period June 9, 2006 to February 26, 2007 RPIL has not dealt in the shares of IPCL but all of sudden started buying the shares of IPCL from February 27, 2007, that is just before the major announcement of declaration of the interim dividend and amalgamation of IPCL with RIL,&amp;quot; the notice said. In its reply submitted in February 2011, RPIL sought an opportunity of inspection of all documents/information relied upon in the notice and an opportunity for the same was granted to the company by SEBI's Investigating Authority on October 18, 2011. However, the company later claimed that it was not shown all the documents. Later in November, 2011, the company however filed for settlement of the case through SEBI's 'consent mechanism'. However, SEBI rejected this plea after due consideration and informed RPIL about the same in November 2012. SEBI said in its order that RPIL did not reply to its show-cause notice in spite of lapse of more than one-and-a-half years, after which it called the company for personal hearing on October 22, 2012, after submit its reply by October 15, 2012. The company, however, sought a short extension of time to submit its reply and for the personal hearing. Later in November 2012, the reply was submitted to SEBI, wherein the company rejected the various charges made against it for violation of insider trading norms. After taking into account the relevant facts and regulations, and the submissions made by the company, SEBI, however, concluded that RPIL had indeed violated the insider trading norms and was liable to be penalised for the same. &amp;quot;From the Investigation Report it is noted that RIL holds the entire share capital of RPIL through two of its wholly owned subsidiaries. As per the Annual Report of RIL for the year 2005-06, RPIL is shown as an 'associate companies and joint ventures',&amp;quot; SEBI said. Besides, the purchase of shares of IPCL by RPIL was financed by Reliance Ventures Ltd (RVL) through an interest free loan, SEBI said, while adding that RVL was a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL. SEBI further said that K Sethuraman, Group Company Secretary of RIL, represented on behalf of RPIL before it, wherein it said that the orders for buying IPCL shares were placed by one Ashok C Jain, who is an employee of RIL. &amp;quot;It is also pertinent to mention that Sethuraman was the contact person on behalf of RIL for interacting with the legal advisor, valuers, financial advisors, etc., in the matter of merger of IPCL with RIL,&amp;quot; SEBI said. &amp;quot;Therefore, in view of the above findings, the charge of insider trading against the Noticee (RPIL) as per regulation ... Stands established,&amp;quot; the SEBI order said."

Rejecting RIL's offer to relinquish 4,233 sqkm of &amp;quot;low prospectivity area&amp;quot; in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has stated that the company should contractually give up 6,601 sqkm out of the total 7,645 sqkm total area in the block. In a six-page note excluding three annexures, DGH director-general RN Choubey on 15 April wrote to petroleum secretary Vivek Rae that of the 19 oil and gas discoveries claimed by RIL, three finds have not been established as commercially viable in absence of test data and the company has not submitted any investment plans for another five. &amp;quot;The ministry of petroleum&amp;amp;nbsp;and natural gas may intimate the contractor (RIL) about cessation of the petroleum exploration licence in respect of 6,601 sqkm of contract area in the first instance in the block KG-DWN-98/3 under Article 3.11 of PSC,&amp;quot; he wrote. He said the area proposed for cessation has at least 1.15 trillion cubic feet of known recoverable gas reserves valued at USD 4.83 billion at current prices. Of the 19 finds, RIL began crude oil production from MA field in September 2008. It started gas output from MA field and Dhirubhai-1&amp;amp;nbsp;and 3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries in the block, in April 2009. Of the rest, declaration of commerciality (DoC), the first step towards monetisation, for D29, 30, 31 and 42 has not been approved by DGH &amp;quot;because of lack of sustainable production test data which a production sharing contract (PSC) requirement,&amp;quot; the DGH wrote. The D-29, 30&amp;amp;nbsp;and 31 finds, according to DGH estimates, may hold 345 billion cubic metres (bcf)&amp;amp;nbsp;of recoverable reserves, valued at USD 1.45 billion. D-42, which holds 11.46 bcf recoverable gas reserves, lies within approved mining lease area of four satellite gas discoveries (D-2, 6, 19 and 22) and hence will have no bearing on relinquishment sought. DGH said RIL has not submitted field development plan for five gas finds&amp;amp;nbsp;- D-4, 7, 8, 16 and 23, containining 805 bcf of recoverable reserves worth USD 3.381 billion, even after expiry of timelines for the same as prescribed in PSC. Further, two discoveries&amp;amp;nbsp;- D-5 and&amp;amp;nbsp;18, were found to be not commercially viable. DGH proposed that RIL should be allowed to retain only an area of 1,044 sq km which will hold the currently producing D1 and D3 gas and MA oil and gas field besides a cluster of four satellite fields (D-2, 6, 19 and 22) and another D-34 discovery. RIL, had in its March 13 proposal, wanted to retain 3,412 sqkm of area containing all the oil and gas finds made till date. Sources said the company made the area relinquishment offer&amp;amp;nbsp;in March just as the oil ministry was readying an order asking the firm to vacate some 5,970 sqkm of KG-D6 block in first instance. Contractually, companies are required to relinquish 25 percent of the area in an oil and gas block at the end of first phase of exploration that spans three years. At the end of second phase, 50 percent of the area is to be given up and by the third phase only such area is allowed to be retained where the company has made a discovery and is required for development and production of the same. The second and third phases are of two years duration each. RIL and its partner Niko Resources of Canada were awarded the KG-D6 block in 2000. The three-year Phase-1 ended on June 7, 2003 while the two-year phase-II expired on June 7, 2005. The third phase ended on June 7, 2007. Sources said DGH in 2006 agreed to RIL proposal of declaring the entire 7,645 sq km as discovery area, thereby allowing the company to retain the full area. The decision was ratified by a committee headed by additional secretary in the ministry and by the petroleum minister thereafter. But the decision was questioned by government auditor CAG as at the end of the third phase, only 79 percent of the block area was covered by 3D seismic survey and yet the entire area was declared a discovery area. CAG in its performance audit in 2011 had asked the ministry to review determination of entire contract area of KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) as &lsquo;discovery area&rsquo;. KG-D6 output has dipped from 69.43 million standard cubic metres a day achieved in March 2010, to under 16 mmscmd in April."

Stating that it has not been informed of any valid reason for lower production of gas in KG-D6 block, the panel said it has noted RIL's demand for higher natural gas price.&amp;quot;The Committee would strongly urge the Ministry to adequately satisfy itself and convince the nation that the fall in production of natural gas in KG-D6 block is not due to commercial consideration or&amp;amp;nbsp; price at which the gas is to be sold,&amp;quot; the report said.  It asked the ministry to seriously look at the fall in output and take urgent steps to increase production. &amp;quot;The Committee also expects the Ministry to apply the provisions of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the contractor (RIL) strictly in letter and spirit in respect of latter's failure to deliver committed production of natural gas from KG-D6,&amp;quot; the report said. RIL produced 39.31 mmscmd of gas from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3), the main gas fields in KG-D6 block, in first year of production 2009-10 as against a target of 27.62.

However, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) once again delayed decision on coal pool pricing mechanism for imported coal by two weeks. Sources informed that a Group of Ministers headed by either P Chidambaram or Sharad Power will be constituted to look in to the coal pool pricing mechanism. The GoM will finalize the proposal on the coal pool pricing mechanism within a week. "

In an investor presentation after announcing the January- March quarter financial results, RIL said a &amp;quot;proposal for relinquishment of low prospectivity area (has been) submitted&amp;quot; to the government. Also read: RIL a must have stock, bet on TCS, HCL Tech: Axis Cap Only &amp;quot;3,412 square kilometers of area&amp;quot; out of a total of 7,645 sq km in KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block will be retained, it said. The area RIL intends to retain contains 18 gas and one oil discoveries including the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas and MA oil and gas fields. RIL said it has submitted to authorities revised field development plans for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 as well as D26 or MA fields that includes work-overs and facility upgrade to improve gas production. &amp;quot;Next wave of projects to exploit the undeveloped discovered resources (will be) targeted over the next 3 -5 years,&amp;quot; it said. Of the remaining finds, the government had last year approved field development plan for four smaller discoveries and the company has submitted investment plans for another cluster known as R-Series. Investment plans for other satellite (D29, D30 and D31) will be submitted once upstream regulator DGH approves their commerciality. RIL made the area relinquishment offer last month just as the oil ministry was readying an order asking the firm to vacate some 5,970 sq km of area of KG-D6 block. Contractually, companies are required to relinquish 25 percent of the area in an oil and gas block at the end of first phase of exploration that spans some three years. At the end of second phase, 50 percent of the area is to be given up and by the third phase only such area is allowed to be retained where the company has made a discovery and is required for development and production of the same. The second and third phases are of two years duration each. RIL and its partner Niko Resources of Canada were awarded the KG-D6 block in 2000. The three-year Phase-1 ended on June 7, 2003 while the 2-year Phase-II expired on June 7, 2005. The third phase ended on June 7, 2007. Sources said Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) in 2006 agreed to RIL proposal of declaring the entire 7,645 sq km as discovery area, thereby allowing the company to retain the full area. The decision was ratified by a committee headed by Additional Secretary in the Ministry and by the Oil Minister thereafter. But the decision was questioned by government auditor CAG as at the end of the third phase, only 79 percent of the block area was covered by 3D seismic survey and yet the entire area was declared a discovery area. CAG in its performance audit in 2011 had asked the Ministry to review determination of entire contract area of KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) as 'discovery area'. In the aftermath of CAG's observation, the DGH recommended to the oil ministry that RIL should be informed that an area of 5,970 sq km is treated as having been relinquished in the first instance. Sources said the ministry had not yet served the relinquishment order on RIL. RIL-Niko have made 18 gas and 1 oil discovery in KG-D6 block. Of these, the largest gas finds, Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3, were brought into production in April 2009 and the oil discovery, MA began pumping in September 2008. KG-D6 output has dipped from 69.43 million standard cubic meters per day achieved in March 2010 to under 17 mmscmd this month. "

This is on account of sharp rise in Gasoline spreads to US USD(21.1)/bbl (US USD16.2/bbl QoQ) which forms higher proportion of Singapore GRM product slate and better Diesel/Naphtha spreads which form higher proportion of RIL&rsquo;s product slate.  Also increase in spread between light-heavy crude oil by US USD0.6/bbl to US USD4.6/bbl has helped RIL GRMs for the quarter.

The better performance during the quarter has come only from refining segment and higher other income. However it&rsquo;s too early to expect a sustained recovery in petchem margins. We maintain our outlook of weak refining cycle going ahead on the back of higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. Structurally, refining cycle is expected to remain weak with incremental net refining capacity additions expected to the tune of 1mbpd/1.3mbpd in 2012 / 2013, as against demand growth of 0.8mbpd / 1mbpd. In case of petchem, demand remains a concern and any weakness in demand could impact any sustained recovery in margins. Gas production from KG basin is expected to decline further and is not expected to reverse the trend before FY15. Positive government stance towards RIL&rsquo;s E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts augurs well for the company but its still time before results come up. We remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of new capacities and/or weakening demand. The stock currently trades at FY15E PE multiple of 12.5x and 1.6x P/BV.

This was 60 per cent of the company's overall revenue of USD 68.4 billion (Rs 3,71,119 crore) in FY13.  Agarwal attributed the spike in exports to the higher demand for diesel and petrol from Asia, particularly China, during the year. &amp;quot;Rising demand from Asia, driven by China and other countries with low refining capacity like Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia and Singapore pushed our exports. The rising demand spiked prices, which in turn improved our export numbers,&amp;quot; he said.

RIL posted a massive 32 per cent jump in Q4 net profit at Rs 5,589, the biggest rise in almost three years, as strong margins in its oil refining business helped offset fall in natural gas production. The better-than-estimated profit, the second consecutive quarter of increase after four quarters of decline, came on the back of rise in earnings from turning crude oil into petrol, diesel and other fuel products.

GRM, the difference between the cost of processing crude and value of finished petroleum products sold, rose to USD 10.1/bbl from USD 7.6/bbl YoY, led by improved diesel and petrol margins. This more than doubled the operating profit for the refining and marketing segment to Rs 3520 crore. The buoyancy in the refining and marketing business helped offset tepid performance in the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas exploration, and petrochemical segments. Revenues from the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas exploration business fell 39 percent year-on-year to Rs 1597 crore due a continued decline in output from the KG-D6 block.

However, the production has since plummeted further to 15.50 mmscmd this week, the lowest level since D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 started production in April 2009.  RIL has so far drilled 22 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields but has put only 18 on production so far. Half of these wells are now shut.  KG-D6 fields, which began production in April 2009, had hit a peak of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down of wells after wells.  This peak output comprised of 66.35 mmscmd from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries on the KG-D6 block, and 3.07 mmscmd from MA field, the only oil discovery on the block.  Besides the fall in output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, gas production from MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, too has dropped.  The report said MA field produced about 6,235 barrels per day of oil during the week ended April 7.  Of the 15.79 mmscmd of gas production from KG-D6, 13.50 mmscmd was sold to urea manufacturing fertiliser plants. &amp;quot;No sale was made to power plants during the period,&amp;quot; it said.

The drilling, they said, has not yet been completed and the company will decide on testing the natural gas found once the well reaches target depth by this weekend.  Also read: Bothra upbeat on RIL, ONGC, HPCL, BPCL The well is being drilled over 2 km deeper than, and directly beneath, the producing D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in the block. Sources said the resource found may be significantly more than RIL's a pre-drill best case gross prospective resource of 819 billion cubic feet of gas and 56 million barrels of liquids for the well. The well is targeting a Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir, similar to the producing MA oil and gas field in the same block. RIL had drilled MJ-1 well in early March after the government permitted companies to drill exploration wells in areas where exploration period had long expired. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields, the largest among the 18 gas finds on KG-D6 block, have proved to be more difficult to produce than previously predicted. RIL has drilled the probe well on the fields to study reservoir characteristic, sources said. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 reservoir has seen sharper-than-expected drop in pressure and water and sand ingress in production wells, leading to a drop in output. The fields have seen output fall from 53-54 million cubic metre per day achieved in March, 2010 to about 12 mscmd this month. Together with less than 6 mscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 is producing about 17 mscmd. MJ-1 well will probe the Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir lying below the D1-D3 (Pliocene) Mining Lease area. While RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 percent interest, UK&rsquo;s BP Plc holds 30 percent and Niko has the remaining 10 percent. Sources said RIL had more than a year back proposed to drill the MJ-1 well but permission for that came this year.  The approval came with the riders that the cost of such wells will not be allowed to be recovered unless it leads to a commercial oil and/or gas discovery. Sources said RIL and its partners will invest USD 350-450 million in the KG-D6 block in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 and USD 400-500 million in the year to March 31, 2015. The investments include expansion of water handling and compression facility at D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, additional gas production well and compressor modification on the MA field and drilling of the MJ-1 prospect.  &amp;amp;nbsp;"

GSPC on Friday submitted to the oil ministry a proposal for pricing of 5.24 million standard cubic metre per day of peak output from its Deen Dayal West (DDW) gas field in block KG-OSN-2001/3 at USD 14.2 per million British thermal unit, industry sources said. Also read: GSPC takes cue from RIL, seeks LNG price of KG gas This price, the firm said, was arrived at through an arms length price discovery exercise it carried out for over a month with supervision of a neutral third party auditor. GSPC had on February 25 asked bidders to quote a positive or a negative number to be added to India's liquefied natural gas (LNG) import formula of 12.67 percent of Brent crude oil plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. GSPC prescribed a minimum sale price of USD 8.50 per mmBtu, at floor rate of USD 65 per barrel of oil. Sources said 37 companies put in as many as 53 bids for about 75 mmscmd. A demand far exceeding the supply was generated when the biddable variable was kept at zero. At cap oil price of USD 110 per barrel, the gas price translates into USD 14.2 per mmBtu. This is the same formula on which RIL had sought bids to price gas from its Sohagpur coal-bed methane (CBM) block in Madhya Pradesh. While the oil ministry, under the then oil minister S Jaipal Reddy, held back the approval for RIL's CBM gas price discovery by putting repeat queries, it remains to be seen how GSPC's proposal will be treated by the ministry under M Veerappa Moily.  Phone calls made to GSPC managing director Tapan Ray seeking comments went unanswered. RIL also had got overwhelming response when over 70 bids totalling a demand of more than 90 mmscmd, several times more than the peak CBM output of 3.5 mmscmd, were received. Its proposal has, however, been languishing in the ministry for 13 months now. Petronet LNG Ltd, of which oil secretary is the chairman, pays RasGas of Qatar a price of 12.67 percent of the average price of crude oil imported into Japan (called Japan Crude Cocktail, or JCC). Besides, it incurs a USD 0.26 per mmBtu cost on transporting the gas in ships from the Gulf nation. Both RIL and GSPC felt this is an arms-length pricing formula and called for bids from consumers on the same.GSPC will produce a maximum of 5.24 mmscmd of gas from the offshore DDW gas field. The gas will land at Mallavaram, near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, and can be ferried to customers up to Gujarat through Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd's East-West pipeline. While the price sought is excluding taxes and other levies, the firm will charge an additional marketing margin of Rs 10.21 per mmBtu."

The case relates to RIL's associate firms short selling Reliance Petroleum (RPL) futures in 2009 a few days ahead of RIL selling shares of RPL in the open market.  RIL has argued that its application for settling the case under consent was rejected despite a Sebi letter, which clarified that the matter was open for consent.  RIL said that Sebi did not provide the 28 documents it had asked for. Also, the High Powered Advisory Committee rejected the company&rsquo;s consent plea, when it can only give recommendations, argued RIL. It is the panel of Whole Time Members which has to take the final decision RIL said, adding that it was challenging the process and not the final order. Sebi has countered RIL&rsquo;s argument saying that no party can compel Sebi to hear matters for consent. Also, the HPAC's rejection of RIL's plea was in line with the Sebi circular issued in May last year, which said that serious offences like insider trading, front running and net asset value manipulation cannot be settled under consent.

An oversight panel, headed by upstream regulator the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), on March 26 approved RIL-BP drilling MA-8 well on the oil field, sources privy to the development said.Also read: Four key events to watch out next week RIL had in February last year submitted a revised field development plan for the MA oilfield, which has been producing crude oil since September 2008. The plan envisaged drilling of one gas well (MA-8) to augment gas production from the field and side tracking of two ceased wells (MA-6H and MA-7H). The Management Committee, which had in August last year approved the revised field development plan for MA, on March 26 approved drilling of MA-8 well, sources said. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 percent stake. UK's BP plc holds the 30 percent and the remaining 10 percent is with Niko Resources of Canada. The company had also in August last year submitted a revised FDP for the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields where water and sand ingress has pulled down production of around 12 million standard cubic meters per day from peak of about 54 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. Together with less than 5 mmsmcd of output from MA field, gas production from KG-D6 is around 16.5 mmsmcd. RIL has so far drilled six wells on the MA oilfield, the only oil discovery among the 19 oil and gas finds the company had made in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Besides producing oil, the field also produces natural gas. But the closure of two out of the six wells due to high water and sand ingress has led to drop in output from over 8 mmscmd three years ago to less than 5 mmscmd this month."

The government has in-principle approved spectrum sharing under new Unified Licences, and details for that are being worked out by the Department of Telecom. Mukesh-led Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJI) and Anil-led RCom, under the new rules, can migrate to Unified Licences by paying Rs 15 crore as entry fee. However to provide mobile telephony services, RJI will have to pay additional Rs 1,600 crore.  RCom will have to also pay one-time spectrum charge to become eligible for spectrum sharing. DoT has raised demand of Rs 173 crore demand for RCom's GSM spectrum and around Rs 1,752 crore for CDMA spectrum. Goldman Sachs mentioned that the 92.5 Mhz CDMA spectrum &amp;quot;could be a good fallback network option for RIL and reduce rollout cost&amp;quot;. It added that with monsoon expected in the next 2 months, it could be difficult for RIL to obtain permission to roll out fibre and build towers. &amp;quot;So leasing them is a faster way to ensure timely rollout of services ahead of the planned launch of 4G services in December 2013,&amp;quot; the report said.Goldman Sachs said that it expects RCom to get &amp;quot;Rs 6 per share value from the recent inter-city fibre optic network sharing deal with RIL.

The Rs 1,200-crore deal, announced by Reliance Jio Infocomm and RCOM yesterday, also proves that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) group would follow an &amp;quot;asset-light&amp;quot; approach for its telecom business, they added. Also read: Rel Comm jumps 6% post Rel Jio deal; ADAG stocks surge A number of investment banks in their research reports today hailed the deal, saying it was strategic in nature for both cash-rich RIL and debt-laden RCOM, especially in the backdrop of difficult times prevailing in the telecom sector. It is the first business collaboration between the two Ambani brothers ever since the parted ways with split of their family business in 2005. The two firms have said that the deal is first in a comprehensive business cooperation framework for optimal utilisation of existing and future infrastructure. &amp;quot;We believe this to be a win-win situation for both RIL and RCOM,&amp;quot; analysts at Morgan Stanley said in their report. &amp;quot;It should result in optimum utilisation of RCOM's existing untapped infrastructure, and RIL will avoid incurring huge capex, gaining access to readily available telecom infrastructure for its telecom / 4G foray. &amp;quot;This is in line with our expectation that RIL will follow an asset-light approach for its telecom business, helping it to protect its Return on Capital Employed,&amp;quot; they said. While Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group is present in telecom business through RCOM, RIL group is gearing up to launch 4G services through Reliance Jio Infocomm. Another report by Barclays said that the agreement was a positive for RIL and it gives it access to 120,000 km of nationwide intercity optic fibre network for a one-time fee for Rs 1,200 crore with no recurring charges. UBS analysts in their report said that their &amp;quot;brief discussion with management suggests more such network/infrastructure sharing arrangement, including tower sharing/leasing will follow with RCOM / other vendors&amp;quot;. UBS report further observed that RIL's recent strategies, including its non-participation in 2G auction and signing of infrastructure sharing agreements, suggest a rational approach towards telecom business. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they see potential for more cooperation going forward, for example, in telecom tower or intra-city fibre network sharing, while adding that the deal was strategic merit from a long-term growth perspective. Shares of RIL, however, fell in the stock market by 2.16 percent to Rs 776.8, while those of RCOM closed 1.9 percent higher at Rs 64.50 after paring most of the intra-day gains."

Also read: Reliance to open five cash &amp;amp;amp; carry stores next quarter &amp;quot;We've sent the letter (to Reliance), hopefully in a day or two they will confirm to us that they've agreed to it,&amp;quot; he added. The CAG had at the end of its first sitting with RIL in January suspended the audit of spending on the flagging KG-D6 block following differences with RIL over scope and extent of the scrutiny. Yesterday, Rae said, &amp;quot;The audit will happen. We are pretty clear about that. We are making all efforts to see that CAG is able to perform its duty.&amp;quot; RIL had previously stated that CAG cannot contractually perform a performance audit on it and Production Sharing Contract (PSC) only provides for a government appointed auditor to verify reasonableness of all charges and credits.  CAG too has now stated that it is not planning to a do a performance audit of the company but only wants to examine &amp;quot;propriety&amp;quot; of expenses made. For doing that, CAG wants the discretion for records to be requisitioned to be vested with the government or its auditor (CAG). &amp;quot;Whatever records are sought will have to be made available,&amp;quot; Rae had said on March 24, adding once the issue of scope of audit is resolved there should be no issues about records being made available. CAG had on March 12 written to the Oil Ministry that its audit of KG-D6 &amp;quot;would be financial and propriety audit&amp;quot; and the purpose of such scrutiny was to ensure that &amp;quot;the government's financial interests have been safeguarded&amp;quot;. This followed Oil Ministry writing to CAG saying the official auditor was being requested to undertake the audit of KG-D6 for 2008-09 to 2011-12 under Section 20 of the C&amp;amp;amp;AG (DPC) Act, 1971. Stating that such audit should be a financial scrutiny, the Ministry told CAG that the provisions of PSC provide for a government appointed auditor inspecting and auditing all records and documents supporting costs, expenses, receipts and income. _PAGEBREAK_ CAG has said it was in agreement with this scope of audit provided the ministry agreed with it on the issue of requisition of records and access. The auditor said that its six-member audit team was at premises of RIL in Navi Mumbai from January 9 to January 31 during which they issued 40 requisitions calling for information and records. However, RIL provided only a few records.On oil and gas exploration, Rae said, the focus area is that the companies, which are exploring oil and gas right now, should be permitted to explore shale gas as well. If two companies start working on the same block then there will be problems. &amp;quot;That is why, we are trying to allowthe operator to explore shale gas in the same block,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;We are making a policy on that which will go to the Cabinet first. Whatever the Cabinet will decide that will be final. Our effort will be to allow existing operators also to explore shale gas, which is the fastest way to get it done. We want speed right now,&amp;quot; Rae said. Further, he said, the biggest challenge for the sector is to &amp;quot;unleash the forces of the government&amp;quot; and the private sector to explore actively for oil and gas in the country as this is not an &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; task. There are huge problems in the exploration blocks that are ongoing. There are controversies and the progress has been slow, he said. Talking about the capex plan of oil companies in public sector, he said, &amp;quot;In the 11th Plan, the target was about Rs 2.26 lakh crore and we did Rs 2.69 lakh crore. In the 12th Plan, it has been increased to Rs 4.38 lakh crore from Rs 2.69 lakh crore.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;So the capex that will be generated by these oil companies through internal resources and through borrowing is being spent, despite the bottlenecks and regulatory hurdles,&amp;quot; he said.  The scenario is not all that gloomy and there are sectors where implementation is happening, he said adding that in the oil sector if money is being spent that means implementation is happening. "

According to the agreement, Reliance Jio will utilise multiple fibre pairs across RCom's 120,000 km of inter-city fibre optic network, while RCom will get Rs 1,200 crore as indefeasible right to use (IRU) fees.  Though&amp;amp;nbsp;the deal is widely believed to be the first step towards integrating telecom businesses of the Ambani siblings,&amp;amp;nbsp;who will&amp;amp;nbsp;benefit more from it, is being acertained by brokerages. In independent analyst SP Tulsian's view, RCom will benefit more from this deal as it will expedite monetisation of its assets. The firm has been looking at offloading stake in both its telecom towers and optic cable network for quite sometime. RCom is operating in a tough market environment where sustaining market share is a task given&amp;amp;nbsp;its&amp;amp;nbsp;high debt level. The deal is definitely a big positive for the firm, say analysts on an average. How does RIL benefit from the deal? Around three years ago, RIL re-entered telecom business after it gave it up to younger brother Anil during the 2005 Reliance empire split.&amp;amp;nbsp;The company's eagerness to launch 4G services is well known, but it never gave a deadline for the same due to lack of infrastructure.  After this deal, Reliance Jio Infocom will use&amp;amp;nbsp;RCom&rsquo;s optic fibre cable (OFC) network to possibly speeden up launch of&amp;amp;nbsp;its 4G high-speed wireless broadband services which is rumoured to be launched later this year. RCom has around 50,000 towers, of which a large number is linked with a fibre-optic backbone, critical for high-speed data transfer. A tower sharing deal between both companies seems likely as it would be economical for RJI to rent out towers rather than build towers on its own to launch its pan-India 4G services, states ICICI Direct in a report released post the deal. What does it mean for Reliance Communications? The optic fibre deal would fetch RCom&amp;amp;nbsp;an one-time fee of Rs 1200 crore and a recurring rental revenue depending on the tariff and bandwidth usage by RJI.  In addition to this, a tower sharing deal could generate an annualincremental EBITDA of&amp;amp;nbsp; Rs 700-750 crore with additional tenancy of 0.4 times on its towers. Also, with the increase in tenancy Reliance Infratel would attract better valuation making it easier for RCom to hive it off and help reduce its mounting debt burden of over Rs 37000 crore,&amp;amp;nbsp;says ICICI Securities. Meanwhile, the deal also talks about further sharing of infrastructure in future on reciprocal basis between both companies.

The MJ-1 exploration well on the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block &amp;quot;was spud in early March and is drilling ahead,&amp;quot; said Niko Resources, the firm's minority partner in the Krishna Godavari basin block.  The well is targeting a Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir, similar to the producing MA oil and gas field in the same block.  The well be drilled over two kilometres deeper than and directly beneath the producing D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in the block.  Results of the well are expected in April or May, Niko said.  RIL has given the well a pre-drill best case gross prospective resource of 819 billion cubic feet of gas and 56 million barrels of liquids.  Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields, the largest among the 18 gas finds on KG-D6 block, have proved to be more difficult to produce than previously predicted and RIL is drilling a probe well on the fields to study reservoir characteristic, sources said.  D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 reservoir has seen sharper-than-expected drop in pressure and water and sand ingress in production wells, leading to a drop in output.  The fields have seen output fall from 53-54 million cubic metre per day achieved in March, 2010 to about 12 mscmd this month. Together with less than 6 mscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 is producing about 17 mscmd.  MJ-1 well will probe the Mesozoic synrift clastic reservoir lying below the D1-D3 (Pliocene) Mining Lease area.  While RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, UK's BP Plc holds 30 per cent and Niko has the remaining 10 per cent.  Sources said RIL had more than a year back proposed to drill the MJ-1 well but permission for the same came only this year.  The approval came with the riders that the cost of such wells will not be allowed to recovered unless it leads to a commercial oil and/or gas discovery.  Sources said RIL and its partners will invest USD 350-450 million in the KG-D6 block in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 and USD 400-500 million in the year to March 31, 2015.  The investments include expansion of water handling and compression facility at D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, additional gas production well and compressor modification on the MA field and drilling of the MJ-1 prospect.

CAG has to audit (KG-D6 spendings) and we will ensure that they get all support for that,&amp;quot; Oil Secretary Vivek Rae said. The Comptroller &amp;amp;amp; Auditor General of India (CAG) last month suspended audit of spending on the flagging KG-D6 block following differences with RIL over scope and extent of the scrutiny. &amp;quot;We are making all efforts to see that CAG is able to do its duty... there have been some differences but they are being resolved and I am hopeful CAG will be able to resume audit by either month or early next month,&amp;quot; Rae said. RIL had previously stated that CAG cannot contractually perform a performance audit on it and Production Sharing Contract (PSC) only provides for a government appointed auditor to verify reasonableness of all charges and credits. Rae said CAG too has stated that it is not planning to a do a performance audit of the company but only wants to examine &amp;quot;propriety&amp;quot; of expenses made. For doing that CAG wants the discretion for records to be requisitioned to be vested with the government or its auditor (CAG). &amp;quot;Whatever records are sought will have to be made available,&amp;quot; he said, adding once the issue of scope of audit is resolved there should be no issues about records being made available. CAG had on March 12 written to the Oil Ministry that its audit of KG-D6 &amp;quot;would be financial and propriety audit&amp;quot; and the purpose of such scrutiny was to ensure that &amp;quot;the government's financial interests have been safeguarded&amp;quot;. This followed Oil Ministry writing to CAG saying the official auditor was being requested to undertake the audit of KG-D6 for 2008-09 to 2011-12 under Section 20 of the C&amp;amp;amp;AG (DPC) Act, 1971. Stating that such audit should be a financial scrutiny, the Ministry told CAG that the provisions of PSC provide for a government appointed auditor inspecting and auditing all records and documents supporting costs, expenditures, expenses, receipts and income. CAG said it was in agreement with this scope of audit provided the ministry agreed with it on the issue of requisition of records and access. The auditor said that its six-member audit team was at premises of RIL in Navi Mumbai from January 9 to January 31 during which they issued 40 requisitions calling for information and records. But RIL provided only a few records."

Besides RIL, French energy giant Total, Russia's Lukoil, CNPC of China and American firm Brown Energy have been shortlisted for the project, according to Iraq's Oil Ministry. Russia's Zarubezhneft and JGC &amp;amp;amp; Tonen General of Japan are the other two shortlisted from 14 companies that expressed interest in taking up the multi-billion dollar project.  The seven qualified firms will now be invited to review data packages and discuss contract terms. Iraq intends to award the project by year end. The OPEC nation has three main refineries - Baiji, Daura and Basra -- with a total capacity of around 567,000 barrels per day (bpd). It wants to increase the refining capacity to 750,000 bpd through improvements in existing plants.  It also plans four new refineries in Karbala, Kirkuk, Missan and in Nassiriya. &amp;quot;The Al-Nasiriya Integrated Project contemplates the development of the 4+ billion barrel Nasiriya oil field in Thi-Qar province together with the construction and operation of a new 300,000 bpd refinery,&amp;quot; Iraq's Petroleum Contracts &amp;amp;amp; Licensing Directorate (PCLD), part of the Ministry of Oil, said. The international engineering and construction firm Foster Wheeler recently completed a Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) study for the refinery. The Nasiriya project marks re-entry of RIL into Iraq. The company's Dubai-based arm Reliance Exploration and Production DMCC had in 2007 taken a 100 per cent stake in the Rovi and Sarta blocks in Kurdistan.  Baghdad termed the award of exploration contract to RIL and other firms by the autonomous Kurdistan region as illegal and threatened to blacklist any firm that dealt with the Kurds. A year after the blacklisting threat, RIL did not apply for being shortlisted for development of oil fields in Iraq.  Thereafter, it did not figure in the list of companies applying to bid for successive licensing rounds of Iraq. RIL finally got rid of the Kurd blocks in July last year when it sold its stake to Chevron Corp for an undisclosed sum. With the Kurd baggage off its back, the company is back at doing business with Iraq and applied to be qualified for the Nassiriya project. After years of war and sanctions, Iraq aims to produce 5-6 million bpd of crude by 2015 against a current output of 3.4 million bpd, the highest in three decades."

Ministry of Petroleum &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas would prepare and submit a note for consideration of the Cabinet Committee on Investment within two weeks, they added.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  Sources said the change of heart came as Oil Ministry pushed very hard saying KG-D6 block has been producing oil since September 17, 2008 and gas from April 1, 2009 after obtaining all requisite approvals. For NEC-OSN-97/2 (NEC-25), the Oil Ministry aggressively stated that six discoveries made in the block could not be exploited because of lack of clearance. "

With CAG suspending KG-D6 audit following differences with RIL over the audit scope and extent, the Oil Ministry is believed to have this week written to the official auditor explaining the scope, extent and manner of audit it wants. Sources said the Ministry wrote that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) was being requested to undertake the audit of block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 of RIL for 2008-09 to 2011-12 under Section 20 of the C&amp;amp;amp;AG (DPC) Act, 1971. According to the Ministry, the scope, extend and manner of the audit will be as spelt out in Article 25.5 and 25.6, read with Appendix C of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) RIL had signed with the government for exploring and producing oil and gas from KG-D6 block. Also read: RIL rises 1% as Credit Suisse maintains outperform rating These provisions of PSC provide for a government appointed auditor inspecting and auditing all records and documents supporting costs, expenditures, expenses, receipts and income.  It calls for verifying reasonableness of all charges and credits, which constitutes a pure financial audit. CAG on the other hand is seeking to do a Performance Audit that allows the examination of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness achieved in the use of government resources. RIL has been insisting that CAG can only do a financial audit and not a Performance Audit and had refused to share some documents sought by the auditor to begin the scrutiny in January.Following this, CAG suspended the audit, sources said. The Ministry, which had given written commitment to RIL that the audit will strictly be in accordance with the contractual provisions, is now sorting out the matter, they said. Sources said the Ministry did not explain the significance of it quoting Section 20 of the C&amp;amp;amp;AG (DPC) Act of 1971 as well as Article 25.5 and Article 25.6 and the Appendix C of the PSC. Section 20 deals with audit of accounts of entities that have not been entrusted to CAG by the law. The terms and conditions of audit of such entities are to be settled between government and CAG, the Section states. RIL too had been in its submissions stating that a private company like it can be audited by CAG only under Section 20 and the Ministry can make CAG its nominee to carry out audit the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits. Sources said the Ministry asked CAG to revert back if its proposition was acceptable to it so as to enable the audit process to move forward."

A division bench of Justices S J Vazifdar and Mridula Bhatkar disposed of Sebi's petition after it was informed that the Delhi High Court had on January 30 this year set aside the CIC order on a petition filed by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) against the disclosure. &amp;quot;Since the Delhi High Court has already set aside the order which has been challenged in Sebi's petition also, nothing survives in this and hence can be disposed of,&amp;quot; Justice Vazifdar said. Senior counsel Janak Dwarkadas, appearing for RIL, told the court that the Delhi High Court, while hearing a petition filed by Reliance, set aside the disclosure order and remanded the matter back to the CIC. &amp;quot;The CIC has been directed by the Delhi High Court to issue a fresh notice to Reliance Industries and other respondents involved and hear the matter afresh,&amp;quot; Dwarkadas said. Chief Information Commissioner Satyendra Mishra had on November 6 last year passed the disclosure order on an appeal filed by RTI activist Anil Agarwal. The case relates to the merger of Reliance Petroleum with Reliance Industries Ltd and the short sale of shares in the former by entities related to the latter.  Sebi had approached the high court challenging the CIC order. In its petition, Sebi has said the fact that the order has been passed by Mishra and not the Central Information Commission (CIC) as a whole, makes it &amp;quot;bad in law&amp;quot; and therefore &amp;quot;null and void and of no effect&amp;quot;.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had in all declared 7 blocks, including RIL's Krishna Godavari basin KG-D6 block and as discovery area of NEC-25 in the North East Coast (NEC) region, &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; zones for reasons like overlapping with proposed Naval base or being close to missile launching and Air Force exercise area. Also read: Essar Oil gets environmental clearances for CBM field While MoD has relented on RIL blocks, five other areas of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), BG Group of UK and Cairn India will continue to be under &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; areas and no oil and gas activity will be allowed, official sources said. Sources said 30 per cent of the 7,645 square kilometre KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin overlapped with the Navy's firing and exercise area and was branded a &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; zone by the Ministry of Defence. MoD was of the view that any exploration and production activities near its Naval Base would hamper surveillance and detection operations and the noise generated due to exploration activities would also compromise the sonar andother radar functionalities. RIL agreed to relinquish 495 sq km of area that fell in the &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; area, following which Navy agreed to realign the boundary required for naval operations for its proposed base to allow oil and gas activities in the remainder of the block. Sources said the change of heart came as Oil Ministry pushed very hard saying KG-D6 block has been producing oil since September 17, 2008 and gas from April 1, 2009 after obtaining all requisite approvals. About 60-70 per cent of the NEC-OSN-97/2 (NEC-25) block fell within the 50 km radius of the Chandipur Missile launch pad and about 50 per cent of the block fell within the danger zone of the Balasore Air-to-Air Firing Range of the IAF. Oil Ministry aggressively stated that 6-7 discoveries made in the block could not be exploited because of lack of clearance, MoD cleared the block subject to area within 100 km radius from the Integrated Test Range (ITR), Chandipur, will still be under the &amp;quot;no-go&amp;quot; zone. No exploration and production activity will be permitted in this zone. Beyond the &amp;quot;no-go&amp;quot; area, oil and gas explorationactivities will be permitted. However, ONGC's two KG basin block KG-OSN-2005/1 and KG-OSN-2005/2 have not been cleared as they fall directly within the boundary of the proposed naval base. Also, the firm's KG-OSN-2009/4 block fell within the range of DRDO's Machhlipatnam launch site and IAF's Suryalanka Guided WeaponFiring Range (GWFR). BG's block KG-DWN-2009/1 falls right at the entry of the proposed naval base (AOB) and hence the Navy could not grant clearance while Cairn's KG-OSN-2009/3 block was in the proximity of the Suryalanka GWFR.  Besies classifying seven blocks as &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; areas, the MoD imposed stringent conditions for another 32. The newly constituted Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) in January-end had asked MoD and Ministry of Petroleumand Natural Gas to sort out differences over the seven block in one month and for the 32 areas in three months. Sources said the Petroleum Ministry was of the view that oil and gas exploration and defence activities can co-exist as was the practice in several countries, including in US. Originally, the Defence Ministry had declared 14 blocks as &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; areas as they over-lapped or were close to proposed Naval base or missile launching range/air force exercise area. But the Defence Ministry later relented and agreed for exploration to be permitted in 7 blocks in Mahanadi basin. One more block which had previously objected to by the Commerce Ministry too had been cleared, bringing down the number of blocks awaiting clearances from 47 to 39. Sources said companies like RIL had already invested close to USD 16 billion in the 39 blocks since 2000 after getting approval from the Defence Ministry at every stage - first for beginning seismic survey, then for drilling wellsand then for constructing permanent oil and gas facilities. Oil Ministry officials insisted that Defence Ministry cannot withdraw the clearance after 12 years of exploration. Blocks like KG-D6 were awarded to companies since 2000 by the Cabinet after clearance from all ministries concerned including the Ministry of Defence. "

According to the research firm, the Sensex EPS is expected to report a moderate 6.3% growth to Rs 1,195 in FY2013 and a more robust 16.1% growth to Rs 1,387 in FY2014. The earnings performance for 3QFY2013 came in below our expectations owing to the slower-than-expected pace of revenue growth. Margin pressure, though, has largely stabilized as margin compression during the quarter was lower than expected. Sensex companies, during 3QFY2013, reported an earnings growth of 9.4% yoy (5.5% yoy excluding ONGC) as compared to our growth estimate of 11.0% yoy. Our coverage companies reported a subdued 5.5% yoy earnings growth (2.8% yoy excluding ONGC) as compared to our growth estimate of 10.0% yoy. Corporate earnings continue to feel the heat owing to slowdown in economic activity, weak capex and high interest rates. Sensex companies witnessed a 9.7% yoy growth in revenue during the quarter as compared to our estimate of 10.3% yoy. Similarly, our coverage companies reported an 8.9% yoy revenue growth as against our estimate of a growth of 10.4% yoy. On a sequential basis, margin performance for Sensex companies improved by 40bp qoq (as against an estimated 6bp contraction) while it contracted by 13bp qoq for our coverage companies (as against an estimated 15bp contraction). Even on a yoy basis, margin contraction came in lower-than-anticipated at 53bp for Sensex companies (as against an estimated 110bp contraction) and 92bp for our coverage companies (as against an estimated 109bp contraction). Oil and gas, private banks and IT companies drive earnings growthAmongst our coverage universe, earnings performance was largely driven by oil and gas companies, new private banks and IT companies. Earnings for oil and gas companies came in better-than-expected at 36.4% yoy, largely aided by the performance of ONGC and RIL. New private banks reported a strong earnings growth of 28.5% yoy (estimated growth of 22.4% yoy) as they continued to face relatively lower asset quality pressures as compared to their PSU peers. IT companies reported a 17.4% yoy earnings growth, mainly led by better-than-expected revenue growth of large cap companies. Telecom, auto and metal companies largely weighed on earnings performance of our coverage universe. Stressed margins led telecom companies to report a 56.3% yoy contraction in earnings. Auto companies, weighed down by the performance of Tata Motors, posted a 26.8% yoy decline in earnings. Metal companies surprised negatively with a 21.8% yoy decline in earnings as revenues for ferrous players declined, and lower realizations dented margins. Sensex outlook and valuation: We expect the Sensex EPS to report a moderate 6.3% growth to Rs 1,195 in FY2013 and a more robust 16.1% growth to Rs 1,387 in FY2014. We maintain our 12-month Sensex target of 22,100, with a target multiple of 16x FY2014 earnings. Our target implies an upside of 14.4% from the present levels. We believe that with positive policy action, the medium-term growth outlook for the economy is gradually improving and there are possibilities for further upsides in the market arising out of improvement in the outlook for earnings growth and rollover to FY2015 earnings.

Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd (GSPC) wants to price gas that it will produce from Deen Dayal West (DDW) gas field in block KG-OSN-2001/3 by third quarter of 2013, at a minimum of USD 8.50 per million British thermal unit, excluding local taxes and margin.Also Read: Angel Broking neutral on Gujarat Gas GSPC, owned by the Gujarat government, will produce a maximum of 5.24 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the offshore DDW gas field. The gas will land at Mallavaram, near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, and can be ferried to customers up to Gujarat through Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd's East-West pipeline. The company in an advertisement issued in national and regional dailies invited bids from potential consumers at price formula at which Petronet LNG gets liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar on a long-term contract. GSPC sought 12.67 percent of the average Brent crude oil price plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. It asked users to quote a positive or negative number, termed as 'V', that can be added to this pricing formula. &amp;quot;Brent crude oil price will be capped at USD 110 per barrel and floor of the Brent crude oil price will be USD 65,&amp;quot; it said in the advertisement. Considering 'zero' as the value of the quotable component 'V', the DDW gas will cost about USD 14.2 per mmBtu at the cap price of USD 110. &amp;quot;Even if bid value of 'V' is negative, floor gas price will always be USD 8.50 per mmBtu,&amp;quot; GSPC said.  A year back, RIL had sought to price gas it will produce from below coal seams, called coal-bed methane (CBM), from its Sohagrpur blocks in Mahdyra Pradesh at 12.67 percent of the average price of crude oil imported into Japan (called Japan Crude Cocktail, or JCC) plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. Petronet pays RasGas of Qatar a price of 12.67 percent of JCC, besides incurring a USD 0.26 per mmBtu cost on transporting the gas in ships. Unlike GSPC, RIL did not set any floor or cap. At a USD 100 per barrel JCC average, CBM was to cost USD 12.67 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, totalling USD 12.93 per mmBtu. GSPC, which sought bids by March 12, said it will charge an additional marketing margin of Rs 10.21 per mmBtu while the consumer will also have to bear all taxes, duties, levies on sale of gas as well as transportation cost and duties and taxes thereon. RIL then extended this pricing formula for its eastern offshore KG-D6 gas when the current USD 4.205 per mmBtu rate expires in March 31, 2014. While the Oil Ministry has accepted a complex international hub-based pricing formula suggested by Rangarajan Committee for all gas produced in the country, GSPC said it as per Production Sharing Contract (PSC) provisions is seeking to discover gas price through competitive arms length basis. Price of gas as per Rangarajan panel recommendation would come to USD 8-8.5 per mmBtu. Great Eastern Energy Corp (GEECL) is selling CBM produced from its Raniganj block in West Bengal at USD 6.79 per mmBtu, while domestically produced natural gas is priced at USD 4.2to USD 5.73 per mmBtu. RIL had sought a marketing margin of USD 0.15 per mmBtu from CBM users, even though its USD 0.135 per mmBtu marketing margin charged on KG-D6 gas has been sent to oil regulator PNGRB for review. Sources said the Oil Ministry was reluctant to approve the price sought by RIL as nowhere in the world is domestic gas priced at LNG rates. RasGas of Qatar prices the 7.5 million tonnes a year (about 30 mmscmd) of gas it sells to Petronet LNG Ltd at 12.67 percent of JCC. Another USD 0.26 per mmBtu is the cost it takes for shipping the gas cooled to turn it into liquid (called LNG) in cryogenic ships. RIL adopted this formula and has sought pricing of its CBM as well as KG-D6 gas in line with it. Now, GSPC too has adopted the formula and has changed JCC with widely quoted Brent crude oil."

RIL provided half of the documents to the team of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) during their three-week stay at the company's office at Mumbai beginning January 9 and wrote to it that the rest, barring a small 10 per cent, would be given when the auditor promised to return on February 11. Sources privy to the development said CAG, however, wrote back saying it will not be coming as promised on February 11. In the meantime, CAG Vinod Rai wrote to Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily that RIL is not cooperating with the audit. The documents that RIL has declined to provide relate to its legal case against the Oil Ministry decision to decline USD 1 billion of cost recovery as punishment for gas output from the main gas fields in KG-D6 block not matching the target. RIL reasoned that such documents are no way related to audit of spending and revealing its strategy to counter the Ministry will compromise its legal case, sources said. Also, RIL has refused to provide any documents relating to selection of technology as it felt the auditor cannot sit on judgement using hindsight to question decisions taken 6-7 years ago. Sources said the firm feels the auditor's job is to verify expenditure and not question technology selection, which can be done only in a propriety audit and such an audit was beyond the scope provided in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for KG-D6. RIL, they said, has kept the Oil Ministry, on whose written assurance that CAG would follow the audit process set out in the PSC, posted of the developments through weekly updates. RIL on January 29 wrote to the Ministry that CAG was seeking voluminous documents of years not related to the period under audit (2008-09 to 2011-12). CAG is demanding documents of previous years even though it had taken copies of documents in the first round of audit."

Natural Gas production from KG-D6 block has dropped to below 20 million standard cubic metres a day this week, from over 63 mmscmd peak output achieved in August 2010. The available gas is first supplied to fertiliser plants and LPG units and whatever little fuel is left is supplied to 25 power plants on pro-rata basis. From the current production only 1 mmscmd of gas is being supplied to power plants, forcing many units to work at sub-optimal levels. To overcome this, the Oil Ministry has proposed to roster gas supplies, official sources said. Under this scheme, gas will be supplied to power plants on rotation basis. Plants will get fuel supplies needed for operating the unit atoptimal capacity for a fixed period turn-by-turn. Also read: Have almost sorted out FSA issues with Coal India: NTPC &amp;quot;Due to shortage in availability of domestic gas many power plants are operating at low plant-load factor (PLF) leading to inefficient usage of natural gas and lower production of electricity,&amp;quot; the Ministry's draft guidelines for rostering of gas said. The Ministry has sought comments on the rostering guidelines from stakeholders by February 28. The rostering can be done only within a group of power plants under a single discom, the guideline said. &amp;quot;On a monthly basis, the overall gas supply from each gas source to a power plant shall be same in energy terms as it would have been without rostering.&amp;quot; Sources said the Ministry, to begin with, wants to apply the scheme to six private power plants in Andhra Pradesh. The acute shortage in availability of domestic gas for the power sector has lead to many of power plants operating at much less than the minimum required PLF. The Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal have seen output fall from a plateau level of about 55 mmscmd in August 2010 to about 15 mmscmd currently. MA oil field in the same block is currently producing just over 4 mmscmd. Of the present production, about 15 mmscmd is supplied to fertiliser plants and 3.12 mmscmd gas goes to LPG extraction plant and the gas transportation pipeline's internal consumption. A little under 1 mmscmd of gas is split between 25 power plants."

The expert appraisal committee (EAC) under the ministry had earlier rejected the group's proposal to use diesel as an alternate fuel at the plant, and advised it to approach the ministry of petroleum for its views on the matter.  The panel, whose nod is required for any change in fuel use at power plants, changed its decision in the light of the oil ministry's move last month to abolish subsidy for bulk diesel purchasers. GVK is operating a 390 MW (expansion phase-II) gas-based power project at Jequrupadu near Krishna-Godavari basin in East Godavari district. &amp;quot;In view of the information provided...the Committee finally recommended that HSD (high speed diesel) may be permitted as top up fuel only till 100 per cent natural gas supply is available,&amp;quot; the EAC said recently after going through&amp;amp;nbsp; documents provided by GVK. GVK told the panel that gas supply from Reliance Industries had been declining and the current supply was about 0.5 MMSCMD instead of 1.1 MMSCMD required. As a consequence, the plant is operating at just 47 percent plant load factor. Due to continuous reduction in gas supply, energy dissemination to the grid has gone down. Hence, to meet the power demand of the grid, it is envisaged to use liquid fuel (HSD) instead of naphtha, GVK informed the EAC. The company had said use of HSD will be an interim arrangement till full natural gas supply is made available. The EAC had in 2012 rejected the proposal on the grounds that the HSD is a subsidised product and hence cannot be used for commercial purposes. However, the decontrol of diesel for bulk buyers paved the way for the gas-starved company to go for HSD as an alternate fuel to run the project. GVK has also obtained the oil ministry's NoC to use diesel. EAC observed that the government order prescribes that power producers using HSD could source their requirement of diesel from oil firms at mutually agreed terms and conditions. It asked GVK to institute a study on radiation due to release of mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the plant. "

This essentially means that cost of drilling any well that does not lead to a discovery, or a small find that could not be independently produced, will not be allowed. Currently, when a company finds oil or gas in an area, the discovery area is ring-fenced and a mining lease is granted for production of hydrocarbons. Operators get to recover all their cost -- whether successful or failed wells, from the oil and gas produced and sold from that particular block. The order said past exploration cost in a development area will not be allowed to recover. It said &amp;quot;any future costs for appraisal, development and production of all such existing discoveries under the new ring-fencing arrangements&amp;quot; will be allowed to be recovered. The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had previously taken a view that further exploration within this ring-fenced mining lease area is not permitted. It felt the government's profit share, which is triggered when an explorer recovers all his cost, would be adversely impacted if new costs are added. RIL and Cairn have maintained that exploration being a continuous process is allowed in the mining lease under which they currently produce gas from eastern offshore and Rajasthan blocks, respectively.

The Finance Ministry wants auto fuel to be priced at export parity by abolishing 2.5 per cent customs duty on petrol and diesel to save up to Rs 18,000 crore in annual subsidy outgo. The Petroleum Federation of India (Petrofed), an apex body of entities in hydrocarbon sector, on January 28 wrote to Finance Minister P Chidambaram saying removing duty protection on products would render &amp;quot;some inland refineries sick&amp;quot; while private refiners like Reliance Industries and Essar Oil may resort to exporting their full production. Budget 2013: Mkt to consolidate; avoid infra, bet oil says IIFL There is no import duty on crude oil and if the same on petrol and diesel is also abolished, there were be no duty protection left to the refineries who included the element of customs duty in pricing of the product to make up for freight, Central Sales Tax (CST) and other charges. &amp;quot;While a change from trade parity pricing to export parity pricing may benefit fiscal management of the government in short term by lowering its subsidy burden but it would render a serious blow to the domestic refineries,&amp;quot; it wrote. It said domestic refineries were removed from the cost plus mechanism on April 1, 1998 and pay the price of feed-stock crude oil on import parity basis. Indigenous crude oil is also paid for the refineries on import parity basis. India imports nearly 80 per cent of its crude oil requirements. Foreign investors put in Rs 1,800cr for OIL stake sale &amp;quot;When the primary raw material is on import parity basis, the FOB export parity pricing for products would clearly be extremely unfair to the refineries,&amp;quot; it said. Making out a case against export parity pricing, Petrofed said Indian refiners ar subjected to a freight cost on crude oil vis-a-vis West Asian refineries which is at least USD 05-0.8 per barrel. In addition, energy costs are higher since energy equivalent to 7 to 8 per cent of throughput is consumed in processing and has to be met by either crude oil based products of imported liquid gas (LNG) whereas the west Asian refineries met such energy needs from surplus gas. Besides, Indian refineries incur heavy demurrage on import of crude oil due to constraints in infrastructure at Indian ports and also pay VAT/CST at the rate of 2 to 5 per cent on purchase of crude oil from domestic producers which is not a pass through. It said for additional resources, the governmnt can consider raising excise duties which are a direct pass through.  Oil Min to go to Cabinet on gas pricing: Moily &amp;quot;The older refineries of PSUs may not be able to cover the cost of refining operations and will be further strained with lack of capital so vitally required for capacity addition or product quality upgradation,&amp;quot; Petrofed said adding refining industry was passing through a downward margin cycle that may result in some inland refineries becoming sick. Private refineries may resort to exporting their full production unless compensated for CST/coastal freight. Petrofed said India's refining capacity has grown from a modest 62 million tons per annum in 1998 to over 215 million tons and is expected to grow to over 310 million tons by the end of 12th Five Year Plan. Private sector has invested over USD 25 billion in the refining industry. &amp;quot;Customs duty on crude has progressively been reduced from 15 per cent to zero and that on petrol and diesel has gone down from 25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. There is nil duty protection on products like LPG, kerosene, ATF, naphtha and FO/LSHS for fertilisers,&amp;quot; it said. C Rangarajan in his report on 'Pricing and Taxation of Petroleum Products' in 2006 had made out a case for some effective protection to domestic refineries as the business was cyclical in natural characterised by very volatile prices. Also, the spread between crude (raw material) and products prices fluctuates widely and there have been instances when diesel prices had lower than crude."

Diesel prices to be hiked 40-50 paise every month: Moily This essentially meant that RIL would get the new price only from April 2014 upon expiry of the fixed five-year term of current rate of USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) can, however, get the new rates this year itself for gas they produce from fields given to them on nomination basis by the government. Gas from nominated fields, called APM gas, is currently priced at USD 4.2 per mmBtu. The Rangarajan panel suggested rates may also not apply to BG Group-operated Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields in the western offshore as the current rates of USD 5.57-5.73 per mmBtu for the fuel produced from these are derived from a pre-defined formula detailed in the PSC. However, Cairn India's eastern offshore Ravva gas, which is currently priced at USD 3.5-4.3 per mmBtu, may be revised as per the committee's recommendations. Sources said the Rangarajan panel had suggested taking a weighted average of the US, Europe and Japanese gas hubs or market price and then averaging it with the net imported price of liquid gas (LNG) to give sale price of domestically produced gas.

RIL plans Jamnagar unit maintenance first week of Feb Perpetual bonds are those with no maturity date, therefore, it may be treated as equity, not as debt. Perpetual bonds pay coupons forever and the issuer does not have to redeem them. Their cash flows are, therefore, those of aperpetuity. However, he expressed hope that the final pricing will be much below the guidance because of the strong fundamentals of the company. When asked why it is raising debt despite sitting on over Rs 75,000 crore surplus cash, the official said, the interest rates are at historical lows and hence it's a good time for Reliance to raise long term money and that the longterm nature of the bond is in line with the long term assets of the company. He further said bank of America, Citi, HSBC, Barclays Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and RBS are mandated for the issue. The RIL official also said this first senior long-rated bond issuance by a domestic company. The funds will be used to meet the capex requirements of the company that runs the world's largest refinery at Jamnagar.

In addition, RIL has low leverage, and strong cash flows and liquidity,&amp;quot; S&amp;amp;amp;P said, adding the positive rating outlook reflects our view that the company has a large cash surplus to protect its financial strength against any potential deterioration in operating conditions. This bond represents the first senior long dated/perpetual issuance by a domestic issuer after Tata Power's recent hybrid, RIL official said, adding only a only a select few Asian issuers have been able to access this market.The transaction extends Reliance's maturity profile and establishes Reliance's credit curve in 10-year, 30-year and perpetual bonds, the official added.

The key trigger to drive this growth is better gasoline and naphtha crack spread. Weak fuel oil spreads had caused material fall in Singapore GRMs. Nonetheless, RIL having significantly lower proportion of Fuel Oil in its product slate was less impacted. The pet coke gasification plant is on track and would take 3 years to come on stream. Despite volume being flat in Q3FY13, petrochemical segment revenues rose by 11.5% yoy and realizations were higher by 11% yoy as prices for most products have increased in line with rising crude oil prices and steep rupee depreciation. On a sequential basis, volumes were marginally low and realizations remained flat. EBIT margins for the segment de-grew by 212bps on a YoY (+90bps QoQ). The sequential increase was owing to improvement in PP, PX and MEG spreads. Overall polyester chain also saw improvement on a sequential basis. The demand growth for all products remained strong across the categories in India.&rdquo; &amp;amp;nbsp;&ldquo;The E&amp;amp;amp;P business has seen reversal in news flow over the last few months, with a slew of approvals coming through for RIL&rsquo;s development plans and budgets for D6. Over the last few months, the company has received approvals for appraisal of CY-D6, drilling of KG-D6 development well G2 (OFDP), work program budget for KG-D6. However, KG-D6 gas production continued to decline (-41% yoy,-16% qoq) in Q3 FY13. Gas production at the Panna-Mukta field was higher by 2.8% yoy, whereas oil production was down by 16% yoy in Q3FY13. Gas production at the Tapti field also declined by 40% yoy over the same quarter. Lower volumes 32.2% yoy and 14.8% qoq, translated into a slump in revenues. EBIT margins for the segment plunged by 15% yoy and 7.7% qoq to 30.7% owing to operational de-leverage. Going ahead, the company has planned to arrest the decline in production but awaits key approvals from the government including budget approvals for capital expenditure. US Shale gas business registered volumes of 32.3 bcf backed by ramp up in production at the Pioneer and Carizzo JV.

The Ministry in a draft Cabinet note proposed accepting in toto the Rangarajan Committee recommendation of pricing domestically produced natural gas at an average of international hub prices and cost of imported LNG instead of present mechanism of market discovery. Sources said ministry wants the pricing formula proposed by the panel to apply to all forms of natural gas - conventional, shale and coal-bed methane (CBM). Also, the price determined shall be applicable to all consuming sectors uniformly. OilMin prepares to take Rangarajan report to CCEA: Sources It, they said, wanted the new pricing guidelines to apply from 2013 itself on all domestically produced gas barring cases where it is either governed by a definite formula prescribed in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) or the government had previously fixed a tenure for the same. This essentially meant that RIL would get the new price only from April 1, 2014 upon expiry of the fixed five-year term of current rate of USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) can, however, get the new rates this year itself for gas they produce from fields given to them on nomination basis by the government. Gas from nominated fields, called APM gas, is currently priced at USD 4.2 per mmBtu. RIL gas output falls to all time low The Rangarajan panel suggested rates may also not apply to BG Group-operated Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields in the western offshore as the current rates of USD 5.57-5.73 per mmBtu for the fuel produced from these are derived from a pre-defined formula detailed in the PSC. RIL, ONGC can see smart rally: Harchekar However, Cairn India's eastern offshore Ravva gas, which is currently priced at USD 3.5-4.3 per mmBtu, may be revised as per the committee recommendations. Sources said the ministry said the Rangarajan panel report needs to be accepted so that domestically produced natural gas prices are fixed in a fair manner and in a way that incentivises production. The panel had suggested taking a weighted average of the US, Europe and Japanese gas hubs or market price and then averaging it with the net imported price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to give sale price of domestically produced gas.  Taking last year's publicly available consumption numbers and the prevailing price of gas in the three markets, the formula suggested by the Rangarajan committee gives USD 8-8.5 per mmBtu as the price of domestic gas.  RIL, which had been engaged in protracted wrangling with the Oil Ministry on pricing of natural gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 field, last week said there was &amp;quot;positive traction in domestic exploration and production business environment with the submission of Rangarajan Committee Report&amp;quot;. The panel had addressed key issues on &amp;quot;gas price mechanism&amp;quot; and created &amp;quot;an investment enabling environment&amp;quot;, RIL said in investor presentation on its October-December quarter results. RIL has since been seeking a price of almost USD 13 per mmBtu for gas produced from KG-D6 gas on expiry of current USD 4.2 per mmBtu price in April next year and its comments on Rangarajan Committee recommendation are being seen as its readiness to accept a lower price. The company, which had previously stated that USD 4.2 was too low for monetising smaller and marginal gas finds in KG-D6 and other blocks, said the Rangarajan panel recommendation &amp;quot;indicates positive sign for monetisation of marginal fields&amp;quot;. The Rangarajan Committee suggested averaging volume-weighted price of gas at US's Henry Hub, UK's NBP and Japan Customs Cleared prices for the trailing 12 months with the the net price that producer got from exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India on a long-term contract. Previously, RIL had from April 2014 wanted to price KG-D6 gas at the rate India pays for importing gas in its liquid form (called LNG) on a long-term contract from Qatar. India pays 12.67 per cent of the international oil rate plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu to Qatar. At USD 100 per barrel oil rate, this translated into a gas price of USD 12.93. The panel headed by C Rangarajan -- Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister -- also suggested gas-on-gas competition after five years and sweeping change in future exploration contracts. The existing PSC allows a company to recover its cost, before giving the government a share in revenue earned from sale of oil and gas. Stating that cost recovery is at the root of the problems being experienced currently, the panel proposed to dispense with it in favour of sharing of the overall revenues of the contractor, without setting off any costs. The committee has also recommended that an extended tax holiday of 10 years, as against 7 years already available for all blocks, be granted for blocks having a substantial portion involving drilling offshore at a depth of more than 1,500 metres, since cost of a single well can be as high as USD 150 million."

This is on account of sharp decline in fuel oil spreads to US&amp;amp;#36;(18)/bbl (US&amp;amp;#36;12/bbl QoQ) which forms higher proportion of Singapore GRM product slate and better LPG/Naphtha spreads which form higher proportion of RIL&rsquo;s product slate. Also increase in spread between light-heavy crude oil by US&amp;amp;#36;1.5/bbl to US&amp;amp;#36;4/bbl has helped RIL GRMs for the quarter.

We revise our consolidated earnings estimate for FY13 to take into account better than expected Q3FY13 performance and performance of shale business. We also assume GRMs of US&amp;amp;#36;9/bbl for 4QFY13 as against US&amp;amp;#36;8.5/bbl earlier. Increase our EPS by 7.2% from Rs.63.2 to Rs.67.8 for FY13E. Our FY14E EPS changes by 5% to Rs.68.3 on account of shale business and higher GRM assumption at US&amp;amp;#36;8.7/bbl as against US&amp;amp;#36;8.5/bbl earlier. We introduce FY15E earnings with expected EPS of Rs.72.1. YoY increase in earning of 5.5% is on account of start of petchem capacities and increased contribution from shale gas business. While FY15 would be the full year for PFY/PTY/PET capacities to contribute to earnings, PX/PTA/MEG capacities are expected to start in 2HFY15. While the concerns on declining gas production in KG basin have remained, RIL stock has moved up by 11% and out performed broader market by about 4% in the last 3 months. While the better performance during the quarter has come from both the core businesses of refining and petchem it&rsquo;s too early to expect a sustained recovery in margins. We maintain our outlook of weak refining cycle going ahead on the back of higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. Structurally, refining cycle is expected to remain weak with incremental net refining capacity additions expected to the tune of 1mbpd/1.3mbpd in 2012 / 2013, as against demand growth of 0.8mbpd / 1mbpd. In case of petchem, demand remains a concern and any weakness in demand could impact any sustained recovery in margins. Gas production from KG basin is expected to decline further and is not expected to reverse the trend before FY15. Positive government stance towards RIL&rsquo;s E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts augurs well for the company but its still time before results come up.

Along with E&amp;amp;amp;P business scenario showing signs of improvement, the Rs 1,200 crore expansion plan in petchem segment is also on track which will boost capacity in FY14. After taking into account these factors, the firm has assigned&amp;amp;nbsp; 'buy' on the stock with a target price of Rs 1000. Axis Capital also believes that the company will push for higher gas prices to recover its cost on the KG-DG project which may eventually happen. It has a positive outlook overall and hence has assigned&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;'hold' rating with a target price of Rs 950. HSBC states though RIL has started drilling more wells in D6, it will take atleast four years for it to start production from them and the current decline from existing well will continue impacting overall performance. Hence, it is 'underweight' on the stock with a target price of Rs 800. Jefferies states that despite the management sounding optimistic over recent regulatory developments in the&amp;amp;nbsp;sector, production recovery in KG-D6 is unlikely before FY16.&amp;amp;nbsp; It further says that RIL will not be able to extend its Rs 10,000-crore buyback plan which investors were earlier betting on. After taking into account these factors, the firm has also assigned&amp;amp;nbsp; 'hold' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 820.&amp;amp;nbsp;"

The share buyback programme, the largest-ever by an Indian company, concluded yesterday, but the final figure might change as the data has been disclosed on the stock exchanges only for shares bought back till January 16.  Billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) began the buyback programme on February 7, 2012 with a target to repurchase shares worth about Rs 10,440 crore from the public shareholders. The company had offered to buyback the shares at a price of up to Rs 870 each under the programme.  The company said in a notification that the buyback of equity shares, as approved by its board of directors on January 20 last year, closed on January 19, 2013, but did not disclose the final tally.  According to data available with the stock exchanges, RIL bought back about 4.62 crore shares, estimated to be worth Rs 3,951 crore, till January 16.  The buyback programme had begun on a slow pace, but gained some momentum in May 2012, when the stock price fell below Rs 700.  The programme was announced with an aim to shore up the value of RIL shares, which had underperformed the markets in 2011. However, The stock have gained nearly 15 per cent in the past one year, but it is still lower than the gains registered by the market benchmark index Sensex.  The stock is currently trading near Rs 900 level, which is much higher than the maximum price of Rs 870 per share fixed for the buyback.  Market analysts believe the purpose of the buyback was price stability and ensuring investor confidence in the stock, which the company has successfully achieved. According to CNI Research Head Kishor Ostwal, the success of buyback offers depends on many factors like willingness to buy the proposed shares and premium sustainability.  &amp;quot;In fact, many corporate houses failed to utilise the entire corpus targeted for the purpose in past and many firms even discontinued buying activities despite shares being available well below maximum buyback price,&amp;quot; he added.

Bhavesh Chauhan, sector analyst from the firm says, &amp;quot;Though RIL is expected to post GRMs at USD 8.5/bbl, it may surprise the market by posting better-than-expected margins similar to Essar Oil which also recorded better GRMs at USD 9.5/bbl in Q3.&amp;quot; &amp;amp;nbsp;He further said, higher other income will boost topline, partly offsetting poor show from exploration and production segment. Giving a segment wise break-up on earnings, Nomura says the company's E&amp;amp;amp;P segment will see its EBIT decline 7% (YoY) to Rs 800 crore on poor volumes, refining segment earnings too will dip nearly 17% to Rs 2940 crore due to sharp volatility in business environment. However, petchem division will grow 4% to Rs 1810 crore. Prabhudas Lilladher states, despite a sharp sequential decline in Singapore GRMs to USD 6.5/bbl during the quarter, RIL's refining margins may come in at around USD 9.5/bbl, outperforming the benchmark. The firm expects the company&rsquo;s E&amp;amp;amp;P and petchem biz to remain subdued and hence profit will dip 7% to Rs 5010 crore, QoQ. Barclays also expects a tepid quarter for RIL after taking into account flat refining margins and weaker gas volumes which will partly offset gains petchem division gains. &amp;quot;Earnings may remain muted for the ensuing six quarters before the company hikes gas price to USD 9.60/mmbtu after April 2014,&amp;quot; it says. For the quarter gone by, profits will be around Rs 5043 crore, down 6%, QoQ, it estimates. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Reliance is expected to report its first profit increase after four quarters of declining profits, according to consensus of analyst estimates, Thomson Reuters Starmine data showed. Reliance shares also gain after a Press Trust of India report carried in the Business Standard newspaper says recent recommendations from a government-appointed panel to look at gas pricing will be submitted to the cabinet for consideration, citing ministry sources. Those recommendations are expected to lead to higher gas prices. Reliance declined to comment on the matter."

According to the research firm, one can buy Reliance Industries February futures in the range of Rs 865-875 and sell Nifty February futures in the range of 6105-6125. Reliance has witnessed the highest concentration of Put options at 840 strike since the inception of the January series. The open interest levels observed closure along with positive move in the stock clearly indicating strong support available for the stock at lower levels. At the same time, with the recent up move, short covering is visible at the OTM 880 and 900 Call strikes, which is likely to augur well with stock upsides. The stock witnessed closure of 20% positions in the recent up move from 820 to 860 levels. Traders had formed positional shorts in the stock in the last couple of years, which they were rolling from series to series. We believe these shorts are stuck up, which is shown in 20% OI closure recently. Hence, this trend is likely to continue and would provide strength to the stock on declines. The stock has been witnessing consolidation since December and the VWAP levels of Reliance are placed at 841 levels. Strong accumulation at 840 Put also bodes well with the argument of strong support at 840 levels. Moreover, noteworthy delivery volumes were seen during last month around these levels. Hence, we expect 840 to remain good support on declines. Due to prevailing consolidation seen in the&amp;amp;nbsp; broader market, stock specific movement may continue. Since Reliance has been unable to perform in line with the index since 2010, we expect the stock to witness fresh upsides and, in turn, outperform the index. The current price ratio (Nifty/Reliance) has reverted from the 50% retracement of the downtrend seen since 2004 to 2009. We believe the price ratio of 7.26 will act as a stiff resistance and it may witness some downtrend in favour of the strategy.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had sought to settle certain investigations into alleged violation of insider trading norms in sale of shares of its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd, but the application to settle of the matter under Sebi's consent framework was rejected by the regulator. Consequently, RIL filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), which had listed the matter for hearing. Sebi, however, sought more time from SAT to study the RIL petition, pursuant to which the Tribunal today adjourned the matter till January 24 for further hearing. RIL's appeal against the Securities and Exchange Board of India was earlier scheduled to heard by SAT for admission on January 4, but it had adjourned the hearing to January 11. RIL is believed to have challenged Sebi's decision to reject its application and also the changes made by Sebi in the regulations governing settlement of cases through consent mechanism -- especially for cases already under consideration. Under Sebi's consent mechanism, companies can seek to settle cases with the market regulator after payment of certain charges and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. In May 2012, Sebi tightened the regulations for settlement through consent framework, as a result of which many cases including those related to insider trading, cannot be settled through this mechanism. On January 3, Sebi published a list of 149 consent pleas, including 16 from entities related to RIL group, which it had found unsuitable for settlement through consent process. These include applications of RIL itself and that of Group Chairman Mukesh Ambani's close aide Manoj Modi. These include 13 applications from various entities in a case involving alleged violation of Sebi regulations for 'Prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trade practices' in a matter of RIL's erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd. Besides, there are three applications related to alleged violation of 'Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations' in the matter of another erstwhile RIL group company - Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL) - which used to be a government-owned company and was later acquired by Mukesh Ambani-led group as part of a disinvestment exercise. Both the companies, Reliance Petroleum and IPCL, used to be separately listed entities, but were later acquired by RIL and got delisted from the stock exchanges.

According to the research firm, supply-side pressures is expected to weigh on crude in FY14, providing the much needed respite for upstream companies from current levels of high under-recoveries and adverse subsidy-sharing scenario. Crude oil prices traded in the narrow range during the quarter, with Brent oil prices averaging at US&amp;amp;#36;110.4/bbl during the quarter. Under-recoveries continues to run high, with quarterly under-recovery estimate of Rs387bn and full year expected at ~Rs1,620bn (Rs1,350bn in FY12). The retreat in refining margins that started in Oct 2FN has continued through the quarter, as more refineries have returned from turnarounds. Singapore refining margins have seen a sharp fall, averaging ~US&amp;amp;#36;6.6/bbl in the current quarter compared to US&amp;amp;#36;9.15/bbl in Q2FY13. India destination LNG prices increased during the quarter to average ~US&amp;amp;#36;12.5/mmbtu, increase in the prices is largely on account of winter season. Crude - prices were range bound (US&amp;amp;#36;105/bbl-US&amp;amp;#36;112/bbl), averaged at US&amp;amp;#36;110.4/bbl in Q3FY13 Brent has continued to hover around ~US&amp;amp;#36;110/bbl mark, on the back of 1) renewed demand concerns (Both IEA and EIA have cut demand forecasts by ~0.1mbpd in 2013) and improved non-OPEC supply outlook (IEA upped its forecast by ~0.15 mbpd) driven by better-than-anticipated output from US shale fields, 2) increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle east supporting prices. We expect supply-side pressures to weigh on crude in FY14, providing the much needed respite for upstream companies from current levels of high under-recoveries and adverse subsidy-sharing scenario. Although recent comments from the Saudi oil minister suggested that demand-supply conditions favour lower prices, a continued risk on environment on account of QE3 could continue to support prices.

Reliance Industries (RIL) had sought to settle certain investigations into alleged violation of insider trading norms in sale of shares of its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd, but the application to settle of the matterunder Sebi's consent framework was rejected by the regulator.  While there were no official word on the contents of the appeal, sources said that RIL has challenged Sebi's decision to reject its application and also the changes made by Sebi in the regulations governing settlement of cases through consent mechanism -- especially for cases already under consideration. Under Sebi's consent mechanism, companies can seek to settle cases with the market regulator after payment of certain charges and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. In May 2012, Sebi tightened the regulations for settlement through consent framework, as a result of which many cases including those related to insider trading, cannot be settled through this mechanism.  RIL's appeal against Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) was earlier scheduled to heard by SAT for admission purpose on January 4, but the Tribunal adjourned the hearing to January 11. Sebi on January 3 made public a list of 149 consent applications, including 16 from various entities related to RIL group, which it had found unsuitable for settlement through consent process.  These include applications of Reliance Industries Ltd itself, as also various group companies and that of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani's close aide Manoj Modi. As per Sebi, these 149 consent applications were rejectedas they were not found to be in consonance with the revised guidelines. Sebi said that proceedings in these cases will continue in accordance with law. These include 13 applications from various entities in a case involving alleged violation of Sebi regulations for 'Prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trade practices' in a matter of RIL's erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd. Besides, there are three applications related to alleged violation of 'Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations' in the matter of another erstwhile RIL group company - Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL) - which used to be agovernment-owned company and was later acquired by Mukesh Ambani-led group as part of a disinvestment exercise. Both the companies, Reliance Petroleum and IPCL, used to be separately listed entities, but were later acquired by RIL and got delisted from the stock exchanges. The merger process for RPL was completed in 2009. "

The oil ministry has moved a note for CCI consideration seeking approval for 47 oil and gas exploration and production areas where the defence ministry has withdrawn clearances or put stringent conditions. Sources said companies like RIL have already invested USD 15 billion since 2000 and the ministry of defence has now withdrawn or withheld clearance to them. Of the 47 blocks, RIL's KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block falls in 14 areas which the ministry of defence has declared as &amp;quot;No-GO&amp;quot;. The reason for classifying the Krishna Godavari basin block, where UK's BP Plc has 30 per cent interest, as 'No-Go' area is that it overlaps with a proposed Naval base. KG-D6, which was awarded to RIL in 2000 by the Cabinet after clearance from all ministries concerned, had been producing oil since September 2008 and gas from April 1, 2009. RIL-BP's Mahanadi basin block NEC-OSN-97/2 where sizeable gas discoveries have been made, too has been classified as &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; area as it is close to missile launching range/air force exercise area. Sources said the other 12 &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; blocks are with state-owned ONGC, Cairn India and Australia's BHP Billiton and reasons cited for withdrawing clearance including being close to missile launching range, overlapping with proposed Naval base, overlapping with Naval firing range and Air Force exercise area. Clearance to oil blocks may be the first agenda that CCI may take up since it was formed last month. "

RIL is investing USD 8 billion, the most since it completed a second oil refinery in 2008, in expansion of its petrochemical business to meet rising demand of plastics and polyester. Also, it is setting up a USD 4 billion petroleum coke gasification project that will produce synthetic natural gas that will replace expensive LNG as fuel."

CAG officials are scheduled to reach RIL's Navi Mumbai office on January 9 to begin the scrutiny, sources privy to the development said. The audit was initially scheduled to begin on January 2 but was deferred to January 9. It had agreed in May to do a second round of audit of spending in KG-D6 block for years 2008-09 to 2011-12 but that could not start due to differences over scope with RIL. RIL had insisted that government can appoint any auditor including CAG to do a financial audit of its spending in KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal but the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) does not allow a performance audit. CAG on the other hand believed that its constitutional mandate does not provide for any restrictions on the nature of audit. Sources said the Oil Ministry had given in writting to RIL that CAG audit will be strictly as per Section 1.9 of the Accounting Procedure to the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). Following this, RIL has agreed to cooperate and provide full access of its books of accounts to CAG. It has also dropped its contention that report of CAG be not made public. The PSC provides for a financial audit -- checking of the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits, but not a performance audit that scrutinises efficacies of processes or technology used in the complex deep sea operations. CAG has agreed for a financial audit of RIL's KG-D6 spendings and a performance audit if it has to be conducted will be done of the Petroleum Ministry and/or the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), sources said adding RIL will provide any document needed in doing such an audit. Sources however did not rule out more scrimmages. RIL, to be begin with, may refuse to provide documents related to the tendering process it followed for buying equipments or in selection of service providers, something which is unlikely to be acceptable to CAG, they said. The auditor may want to examine whether government's profit take from KG-D6 and its subsidy output on power and fertiliser increased on account of use of imported LNG due to KG-D6 output of just 20 million standard cubic meters per day not matching the projected profile of 80 mmscmd. CAG had in its first round of KG-D6 audit begun on the premise of doing a financial audit but the report tabled in Parliament last year stated that the auditor had conducted a performance audit.

Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas - During 3QFY2013, the price of Brent crude oil remained in the range of US&amp;amp;#36;108-117. Overall, average Brent crude oil was flattish during 3QFY2013. Further, the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil price also remained flat, broadly reflecting a flattish move in the price of Brent crude. Average Henry Hub natural gas price increased by 17.2% qoq after falling steeply over the past one year. Further, the Asian spot LNG price remained firm on account of demand-supply mismatch in Asia. Prices of petrochemical products, on the other hand, increased by 7.1% on a qoq basis during 3QFY2013. During September and October 2012, the Indian crude oil basket for oil prices stood at US&amp;amp;#36;112/bbl and US&amp;amp;#36;110/bbl, respectively. Rise in international crude oil prices coupled with INR depreciation against the USD resulted in higher under-recoveries for oil marketing companies (OMCs) on account of selling diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG at subsidized rates. During the first half of December 2012, OMCs continued to lose Rs 411cr per day. OMCs continued to lose Rs 9.3/liter, Rs 30.1/liter and Rs 521/cylinder on diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG, respectively. 3QFY2013 expectationsFor 3QFY2013, we expect mixed profitability performance for our coverage companies.

Moily, who took over as the minister at the end of October, allowed companies to drill exploration wells within an oil and gas field, but with the condition that cost recovery of such wells would be allowed only in case there is a commercially exploitable discovery. This essentially means that cost of drilling any well that does not lead to a discovery or a small find that could not be independently produced, will not be allowed. Also Read: Oil companies gain on gas pricing reform hopes Currently, when a company finds oil or gas in an area, the discovery area is ring-fenced and a mining lease granted for production of hydrocarbons. Operators get to recover all their cost -- whether successful or failed wells, from the oil and gas produced and sold from that particular block. The DGH had previously taken a view that further exploration within this ring-fenced mining lease area is not permitted. It felt the government's profit share, which is triggered when an explorer recovers all his cost, would be adversely impacted if new costs are added. To overcome this, the ministry has put a condition that cost of the fresh exploration will be allowed to be recovered only when a new commercial discovery is made, sources said. &amp;quot;...cost recovery of such exploration being subject to establishment of commerciality of the new discovery..., mitigating any risk to the government revenue from existing discoveries,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote to DGH. &amp;quot;Cost recovery will be governed by current provisions of PSC on establishment of commerciality.&amp;quot; RIL and Cairn have maintained that exploration being a continuous process is allowed in the mining lease under which they currently produce gas from eastern offshore and Rajasthan blocks respectively. They felt the 'ring-fencing' proposed by DGH and seconded by the Oil Ministry was not practical and legal. While RIL has proposed to drill an exploration well on the flagging D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block to study reservoir characteristic, Cairn wants to drill new probes to help raise output from the Rajasthan block to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 175,000 bpd. Globally, exploration is permitted in fields that are under production so as to keep adding new reserves to replenish ones that have been produced. In absence of rejuvenation, the fields will terminally decline from the day output starts. The same has been followed in fields in Assam and Mumbai offshore."

The SEBI included Reliance Industries and a handful of its units on a list of 149 companies or individuals whose requests to settle market rules violation cases with financial payments had been rejected, a notice issued late on Thursday showed. Also read: RIL sells 2013 gasoil, jet fuel at high premiums A Reliance spokesman declined to comment on the SEBI announcement. The dispute with Reliance stems from SEBI's investigation into suspected insider trading when the energy conglomerate sold stock futures of Reliance Petroleum before folding the unit into its operations. Reliance Industries has denied engaging in any insider trading in that transaction. SEBI amended its procedures for so-called consent applications, or requests for out-of-court settlements, in May 2012, effectively banning the use of monetary payments to resolve suspected cases of market rule violations, including insider trading. The regulatory changes followed criticism that consent orders were being inappropriately used by those under investigation to avoid potentially more damaging rulings by the regulator on wrongdoing. Uncertainty had remained, however, over whether consent applications such as Reliance Industries' that were submitted before the rule change would be allowed to go ahead. Although the possibility of a settlement under the old consent applications has been removed, the regulator's brief statement said only that proceedings would continue in accordance with the law, offering no clues on how much longer the case might drag on. Reliance shares in Mumbai had edged down 0.4 percent as of 1:25 p.m., compared with a 0.5 percent gain in the NSE's energy subindex."

Motilal Oswal said Oil India Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd, and Reliance Industries would be the biggest beneficiaries of the proposed formula, which involves volume-weighted international prices for gas producers. While the government would take a final decision on the recommendations, our analysis indicates that domestic producers shall benefit from the proposed gas price formula, analysts at Motilal Oswal said.

Following criticism that the consent plea&mdash;under which an entity under investigation pays a penalty without admitting or denying guilt&mdash;was allowing many offenders to get away lightly, the regulator modified the rules for considering such applications. While rejecting the 149 applications, Sebi said the decisions were in line with the revised consent plea rules. Under the new rules, insider trading, front-running, failure to make an open offer to shareholders of a listed firm, and manipulation of net asset value (NAV) of mutual funds can no longer be settled through a consent plea. For the first time, Sebi has named the various associate entities of Reliance Industries facing charges of insider trading. These include:  Vinamra Universal Traders Pvt Ltd  Reliance Ports &amp;amp;amp; Terminals Ltd  LPG Infrastructure (India) Limited  Gujarat Petcoke and Petroproducts Supply Pvt Ltd  Relogistics (Rajasthan) Pvt Ltd  Relogistics (India) Pvt Ltd  Relpol Plastic Products Pvt Ltd  Darshan Securities Pvt Ltd  Fine Tech Commercials Pvt Ltd  Dharti Investment &amp;amp;amp; Holdings Limited  Aarthik Commercials Pvt Ltd  Mo Tech Software Pvt.

When the Reliance Petro share price crashed, so did the futures' price, and RIL's associate firms covered their short positions in Reliance Petro futures at lower levels, netting a handsome profit. Media reports estimate the gains from this trade around Rs 500 crore. The list of rejected pleas also includes violation of insider trading rules by Reliance Petroinvestments, Manjoj Modi and Smita Modi, in the erstwhile Indian Petrochemicals Chemicals which was taken over by Reliance Industries. Other well-lnown companies whose consent pleas have been rejected included GMR Holdings, Valecha Engineering, India Infoline, Religare, Sanwaria Agro, HSBC Investdirect."

RIL's appeal against Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) was earlier scheduled by SAT for tomorrow for admission, but the Tribunal has adjourned the hearing to January 11.  While details of RIL's appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) could not be immediately obtained, Sebi has previously issued show-cause notices to the company in cases involving sale of shares of its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) and allotment of shares to certain firms against warrants linked to privately placed debentures issued by RIL. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has already replied to Sebi notices in these cases. In the case involving sale of shares of RPL, Sebi is said to have been investigating for a long time the alleged violation of insider trading regulations by RIL.  RPL used to be a separately-listed company, but it was later acquired by RIL and the merger process was also completed way back in 2009. RIL has previously sought to settle the case through Sebi's consent mechanism, which allows for settlement of cases without admission or denial of guilt after payment of certain charges and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, if any.  However, Sebi has rejected RIL's consent pleas on more than one occasion, terming the proposed payments as too less and on other grounds. As per the company's annual report for the fiscal year 2011-12, Sebi had issued it show-cause notices in connection with the sale of shares of erstwhile RPL and the allotment of RIL shares to certain companies against detachable warrants attached to privately placed debentures issued by it. &amp;quot;The company has submitted its reply to the same,&amp;quot; RIL had said in the annual report. RIL is currently buying back shares under a programmelaunched in February last year and has repurchased shares over Rs 3,800 crore from public shareholders since then -- achieving 37 per cent of the targetted amount of Rs 10,440 crore. The buyback programme, already the biggest buy-back by an Indian company, would end on January 19, 2013. Yesterday, Sebi proposed significant changes to existing framework for buyback of shares by companies from open market, including lowering the process for its completion to three months and a minimum repurchase of 50 per cent of the target. The proposals have been made in a discussion paper floated by the market regulator and a final decision would taken after taking into account comments from the public. "

The order, it said, was issued considering the fact that many power plants in the country were operating at low Plant Load Factor (PLF) due to acute shortage in availability of domestic gas leading to inefficient production of electricity. KG-D6 gas output at about 20 million standard cubic meters per day is one-third of the allocations made. &amp;quot;The clubbing/diversion, in all spells, should not be for a period of more than a year in total and clubbing/diversion of gas should lead to higher production of electricity compared to pre-clubbing arrangement,&amp;quot; the statement said. The cost of the gas, so diverted, would be in accordance with the price based on the source of the diverted gas so that there is no financial burden on the end consumers. &amp;quot;The entity seeking clubbing/diversion would bear any additional financial liability arising from the existing and future Gas Sale Agreement(GSA)/Gas Transport agreement(GTA) and any other swapping transaction resulting there from and the end-use of the diverted gas would remain the same i.e. supply of power to State Discom,&amp;quot; it said. The power plants would, therefore, have to obtain no objection from the concerned power distribution company (discom) to which they are supplying electricity (pre-clubbing /diversion) and the Ministry of Power shall operationalise the arrangement.
