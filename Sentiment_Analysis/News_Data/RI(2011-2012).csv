RIL's repurchase of shares is already the biggest buy-back by an Indian company, after Piramal Healthcare bought back shares to the tune of Rs. 2,508 crore in 2011. RIL's buyback would end on January 19, 2013. According to data available with the exchanges, Reliance Industries (RIL) which began a buyback programme of Rs. 10,440 crore early this year, has so far purchased shares worth Rs. 3,855 crore. This translates to about 37 per cent of the total targeted amount. Between February 14 and December 24, RIL has purchased 4.62 crore shares from the secondary market at an average price of Rs. 834 apiece. RIL's buyback programme had begun on a slow pace, but gained some momentum in May. The programme was announced with an aim to shore up the value of RIL shares, which have underperformed the markets last year and have been mostly trading on a sluggish note in the recent months as well. The stock is currently trading near Rs. 840 level, which is much below the maximum price of Rs. 870 per share fixed for the buyback. According to CNI Research Head Kishor Ostwal, the success of buyback offers depends on many factors like willingness to buy the proposed shares and premium sustainability. &amp;quot;In fact, many corporate houses failed to utilise the entire corpus targeted for the purpose in past and many firms even discontinued buying activities despite shares being available well below maximum buyback price,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;I do not think RIL would complete even 50 percent of the targeted amount and it would aggressively buyback shares in case the price falls drastically,&amp;quot; Ostwal said. Citigroup Global Markets, HSBC Securities &amp;amp;amp; Capital Market and DSP Merrill Lynch are the managers for the offer. "

The 12th Five-Year (2012-17) Plan adopted by the National Development Council (NDC) on Thursday said, &amp;quot;Natural-gas prices charged to producers must be determined by market forces.&amp;quot; Currently, majority of the natural gas produced in the country is priced at USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit (mBtu), which is almost a third of the rate at which gas in its liquid form, called liquefied natural gas or LNG, is imported. RIL and its partner BP Plc have been pitching for market-based pricing for the natural gas produced from eastern offshore KG-D6 fields. &amp;quot;The concept of a uniform gas price across consuming sectors also needs to be examined afresh as the desire to keep prices low for certain sectors tends to distort pricing; it is inconsistent with the principle that the price of gas will be determined by market forces,&amp;quot; it said. Addressing the NDC, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stated that natural gas and coal and other liquid-fuel rates in India were &amp;quot;well below international prices&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;If domestic energy prices are too low, there will be no incentive to increase energy efficiency or to expand supply,&amp;quot; he had said. &amp;quot;Immediate adjustment of prices to close the gap is not feasible, but some phased price adjustment is necessary.&amp;quot; The demand for natural gas, the 12th Plan document said, will increase from 194 million standard cubic metres per day in 2011-12 to 286 mmscmd in the current fiscal. This is expected to rise to 466 mmscmd by the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan in 2016-17. The Plan document said there was a need for clarity on fiscal incentives on exploration of natural gas under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP). Currently, a seven-year holiday from payment of income tax is available only for crude oil produced from an area awarded under NELP. Natural gas produced from the same well does not attract any tax incentive. It called for according a'declared goods status' for natural gas/LNG so that it is available at uniform prices in most states. The Plan document called for eliminating &amp;quot;the uncertainty that has arisen regarding gas-pricing from NELP production-sharing contracts by implementing a new design of contracts&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The recommendation of the Rangarajan Committee may be an important input in finalising this policy,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Appropriate steps should be taken to resolve conflicts in existing contracts where the interpretation of the contract term is open to multiple options.&amp;quot;"

Nitin Agarwal: What about Reliance Industries (RI)? A K Prabhakar:&amp;amp;nbsp;In the short-term to medium-term, the pressure is likely to continue. But post FY14 the stock can become outperformer. So, if your view is for the long-term, you may hold. Bhushan Mulay: Can I buy Bharti Airtel now? A K Prabhakar: We are cautious on telecom as a whole sector mainly due to the regulatory issues.

Mishra, an appellate authority in Central Information Commission(CIC), had on November 6 passed an order directing capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to disclose all details about the case on an appeal filed by RTI activist A K Agarwal. The case relates to the merger of Reliance Petroleum with Reliance Industries and the short sale of shares in the former by entities related to the latter. The merger between the two companies took place in 2009 and the company has been charged of indulging in insider trading. The CIC, acting on a petition filed by Agarwal, ordered SEBI on November 6 to disclose the details of investigation in the case or consent order proceedings. However, Sebi approached the high court challenging the CIC order. A division bench of D Y Chandrachud and Amjad Sayed today, while directing Reliance Industries to file its reply affidavit to the petition by January 21, said,&amp;quot;Wasn't Reliance bound to be heard by CIC before disclosure order was passed?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;If the disclosure pertains to a third party, in this case Reliance, then the third party should be heard before order is passed. They (Reliance) are entitled to it,&amp;quot; Justice Chandrachud said. Agarwal, however, told the court that as per section 8(2) of the RTI Act, if the information sought is in public interest, then it outweighs protection of the third party. &amp;quot;This is a case of insider trading worth Rs 500 crore. Penalty is up to Rs 1500 crore,&amp;quot; Agarwal argued. In its petition, Sebi said the order was passed by Mishra and not the CIC as a whole, makes it &amp;quot;bad in law&amp;quot; and therefore &amp;quot;null and void and of no effect&amp;quot;. Apart from Mishra, the CIC has seven other members. Reliance Ind has approached Sebi to settle the case through mechanism of consent process where an entity being investigated pays a fine without admitting fault and the regulator drops the case. "

The company said it has been selected for providing voice call and video technology by IBSL. &amp;quot;Reliance intends to invest USD 10 billion in its LTE (4G) network and has turned to SPIRIT's software products for voice and video calls over LTE instead of waiting for phone makers who are slow in offering handsets transmitting voice and video in 4G networks,&amp;quot; Spirit DSP said in a statement. IBSL is the only company in the country to have 20 Mhz of pan-India airwaves that it can use for providing 4G services. No immediate comments were available from RIL on Spirit DSP's statement. Spirit DSP said, through its solution, Reliance will be able to offer its subscribers high-quality services as an alternative to Skype - an application for making voice calls using internet connection, over cellular networks. At present, most of the people are able to make free calls using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application like Skype but in India such calls are allowed only between personal computers to personal computers. In October, IBSL has informed the Telecom Ministry that it is ready for trial runs of a technology that would enable voice calls service on its wireless broadband network and has sought allocation of number series to test its newly developed 'Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology. The telecom arm of RIL has told Ministry that it has developed a technology in preparation of a unified licensing regime recommended by the regulator TRAI under which consumers will be able to get voice, messaging and video using a single device. Sharing details of its plan, IBSL has said that VoLTE technology would enable it to work seamlessly with the existing 2G, 3G, NLD and ILD networks. It added that termination and receiving of calls from these networks to the IBSL network would be possible through the VoLTE technology."

The Ministry is contemplating asking Solicitor General Robinton Nariman for an opinion on if the contracts of RIL and Cairn or the mining lease given to them for producing oil and gas, permits drilling of exploratory wells, official sources said. The Oil Ministry was in favour of granting permission to drill exploration wells within an oil and gas field, but with the condition that cost recovery of such wells would be allowed only in case there is a commercially exploitable discovery. This essentially meant that cost for drilling any well that did not lead to a discovery or a small find that could not be independently produced, will not be allowed. At present, operators get to recover all their cost -- whether successful or failed wells, from the oil and gas produced and sold from that particular block. Sources said the ministry's technical arm DGH had opined that drilling of exploration wells in already producing oil and gas fields is not permissible under Production Sharing Contract (PSC). DGH felt the government's profit share, which is triggered when an explorer recovers all his cost, would be adversely impacted if new costs are added. RIL and Cairn however said exploration being a continuous process is allowed in the mining lease under which they currently produce gas from eastern offshore and Rajasthan blocks respectively. They felt the 'ring-fencing' proposed by DGH and seconded by the oil ministry was not practical and legal. Sources said Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily wants to test the legality of the claims and is keen to get an opinion of the Solicitor General. While RIL has proposed to drill an exploration well on the flagging D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block to study reservoir characteristic, Cairn wants to drill new probes to help raise output from the Rajasthan block to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 175,000 bpd. Globally, exploration is permitted in fields that are under production so as to keep adding new reserves to replenish ones that have been produced. In absence of rejuvenation, the fields will terminally decline from the day output starts. The same has been followed in fields in Assam and Mumbai offshore."

Also Read: 'CAG will confine to financial audit of KG-D6 block' Gas production from D6 has declined to about 23 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd), the source said. A Reliance spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Production at the block may average 22.6 mmscmd in the fiscal year starting April 2013 and is projected to decline to 20 mmscmd in 2014/15, only about a third of the 60 mmscmd it produced in 2010 and well below the planned peak capacity of 80 mmscmd. Reliance may have to shut under-performing gas fields in 2015-16, oil secretary GC Chaturvedi said in October, while Morgan Stanley analysts have said the key gas producing fields in D6 could be exhausted in 5 years. Reliance brought in the British oil and gas company last year, which paid USD 7.2 billion to invest in 23 oil and gas blocks with the Indian firm, hoping its offshore expertise would help arrest the decline in output. The D6 block, now jointly operated by Reliance and BP, was expected to contribute up to a quarter of the gas supply for Asia's third-largest economy. Reliance and BP submitted a revised field development plan in September, cutting the gas reserves in the D6 block by about two-thirds to 3.4 trillion cubic feet, the oil ministry said last month. Reliance had government approval to drill 50 wells and had drilled only 22 with 4 turning out to be dry, the source said. Canadian company Niko Resources owns 10 percent interest in the block, while Reliance holds 60 percent and BP the rest."

RIL on November 29 shut well B4 on the main producing fields of Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) in KG-D6 block &amp;quot;due to high water cut/sanding issues,&amp;quot; according to a status report of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). Also Read: 'CAG will confine to financial audit of KG-D6 block' The shutting of the seventh well saw output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields drop to 19.02 million standard cubic meters per day from about 20 mmscmd a month ago. Together with 4.25 mmscmd from MA oil field in the same block, KG-D6 produced 23.27 mmscmd of gas in the week ending December 2, DGH said the status report dated December 3. RIL has so far drilled 22 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields but has put only 18 on production so far. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, which started gas production in April 2009, had touched a peak of 55 mmscmd in August 2010 before beginning of water and sand ingress in wells. The company had closed six wells since end-2010 and last month the seventh well was shut. The same problem has held to shutting of one-third of the wells on MA oilfield in the same block. Output from MA is half of the peak rate it had achieved in 2010. Sources said RIL had last year proposed to do workover or maintenance job to revive sick or closed wells but the Oil Ministry and DGH are yet to give their go ahead. The USD 100-120 million spending in the workover is part of the capital Budget for current fiscal which along with the same for 2010-11 and 2011-12 is pending approval. Oil Ministry says it has withheld approvals pending RIL agreeing to give the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) access of its books to conduct a second round of audit. The audit has not begun because of difference over scope of the scrutiny. RIL has so far made 18 gas and one oil discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin block in Bay of Bengal. While the lone oil find, MA went on stream in September 2008, largest among the gas finds, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 were put on production in April, 2009. Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily had previously informed Parliament that RIL had not drilled its committed 31 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 field, which was the main reason why current output does not match the targetted 80 mmscmd for this time of the year. The government, he had said, does not accept RIL's contention that geological reasons alone were responsible for the decline. RIL and its partner BP believe any additional wells in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields may not improve either production or recovery rates considering reservoir behaviour and the key to raising output was to quickly put other finds on production."

The PSC provides for a financial audit - checking of the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits, but not a performance audit that scrutinises efficacies of processes or technology used in the complex deep-sea operations.  &amp;quot;The CAG has agreed for a financial audit (of RIL's KG-D6 spendings) and a performance audit if it has to be conducted, will be done of the petroleum ministry and/or the directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH),&amp;quot; the official said. RIL will provide any documents needed in doing such an audit, he added. Sources, however, maintained that the CAG statement did not mean an end to the stalemate between the official auditor and RIL. The company, to be begin with, may refuse to provide documents related to the tendering process it followed for buying equipment or in selection of service-providers, something which is unlikely to be acceptable to the CAG, they said. The auditor may want to examine whether government's profit take from KG-D6 and its subsidy output on power and fertiliser increased on account of use of imported LNG due to KG-D6 output of just 23 million standard cubic metres per day not matching the projected profile of 80 mmscmd.  The CAG had in its first round of KG-D6 audit begun on the premise of&amp;amp;nbsp; conducting a financial audit but the report tabled in Parliament in 2011 stated that the auditor had conducted a performance audit. In May, it agreed to conduct a second round of audit for years 2008-09 to 2011-12 but that hasn't started due to differences over scope. Sources said CAG may, even this time around, conduct a performance audit of KG-D6, where gas output has lagged targets mentioned while getting spending approvals, as it feels its constitutional mandate is bigger than any agreement that the oil ministry may have with a contractor.

HPCL last week asked the ministry to give firm allocation of Rajasthan crude oil for at least 10 years for it to begin work on the 9 million tonne a year refinery, sources with direct knowledge of the deliberations said. Also Read: Crude Oil prices may trade with positive bias: Nirmal Bang Cairn produces about 175,000 barrels a day or 8.75 million tonne a year of crude oil from its Mangala and other fields in the Rajasthan block. Going fowards, the firm is projecting an output of 300,000 bpd (15 million tonne). But the approved plateau is only 175,000 bpd and there is no certified data available to state that this level will last for the next 15 years (five years for refinery construction and 10 years allocation as requested by HPCL). Sources said an inland refinery is not feasible unless it has a definite source of crude oil for initial 10 years of operations. Without a crude source, it does not make any sense to build an inland unit and the company would rather look at a coastal option where crude oil can be imported from abroad. For an inland refinery, crude oil will have to be first imported at a port on the west coast, probably in Gujarat, and then transported to hinterland through an expensive pipeline. Crude oil produced at Rajasthan is transported through world's largest heated pipeline from Barmer to refiners like Reliance Industries and Essar Oil in Gujarat. Sources said if Rajasthan crude oil is allocated to the proposal refinery, this pipeline can be used for transporting imported crude oil from Gujarat coast in subsequent years. HPCL is to hold 51 per cent stake in the proposed refinery project while state-owned engineering consultancy firm EIL would take 5 per cent. Vedanta Resources, which last year acquired Cairn India for USD 8.67 billion, is interested in taking a small equity of 2-3 per cent in the project. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd and Rajasthan government too are keen on a stake in the refinery. ONGC, which owns 30 per cent interest in the Barmer oilfields of Cairn India, had in 2005 committed to building the refinery in Rajasthan but later had a change of heart. Sources said after HPCL decided to take up the project, ONGC, which originally had the authorisation from the government for processing the Barmer crude at the proposed refinery, too evinced interest in taking 26 per cent stake. However, HPCL is not keen on giving anything more than 16.96 per cent to ONGC. This being equivalent to the stake that ONGC has allowed HPCL to hold in Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd."

Also Read: RIL opposes uniform marketing margin for natural gas Sources said RIL and its partner BP Plc on October 8 proposed to do a single Drill-Stem Test (DST) on the three finds to establish them as commercially viable finds. &amp;quot;Gas discoveries D-29, 30 and 31 were notified and accepted as independent discoveries, as reservoir pools were distinct and unconnected. Hence operator's (RIL's) submission that all three discoveries have same geological system is not adequate,&amp;quot; DGH wrote to RIL on November 27. DGH, however, wants three separate DSTs to be done before approving their declaration of commerciality (DoC). DoC is pre-requisite for any discovery to be developed. &amp;quot;DST in each of the three discoveries is necessary to establish absolute open flow potential (AOFP) and other reservoir parameters in order to review the DoC of D-29, 30 and 31,&amp;quot; DGH said. &amp;quot;The PSC also requires the flow to be measured at the surface by conventional petroleum industry testing methods, so as to establish sustainable production levels,&amp;quot; it added. The three finds are part of the cluster that is called the R-Series in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block. RIL believes D-29, 30 and 31 together with the largest discovery in cluster, D-34 hold gross in-place reserves of 2.207 trillion cubic feet and the four could together produce a peak output of up to 20 mmscmd. A block oversight committee headed by DGH, however, disassociated D-29, 30 and 31 and approved only D-34 with 1.267 tcf of reserves. D-34 alone can produce 14.68 mmscmd of gas from 11 wells for eight years on an investment of USD 2.338 billion. Sources said RIL-BP believes the three discoveries have resources of around 350 billion cubic feet which has the potential to add 5-7 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) to the KG-D6 production in four-five years. DGH said RIL's proposal to undertake DST in one discovery well was acceptable with the condition that a successful test would lead to drilling of development wells in that particular reservoir only. Output from KG-D6 has fallen to 23 mmscmd after hitting a peak of 62-63 mmscmd in August 2010 and the satellite finds are crucial in plans of RIL-BP to reverse the trend."

RIL, whose 13.5 cent per million British thermal unit as marketing margin on KG-D6 gas is higher than 11 cents charged on gas produced by ONGC/OIL but lower than 18 cents that charges for western offshore gas, said there was no legal basis to regulate the levy.  RIL President and COO B Ganguly on November 29 wrote to Oil Secretary debunking oil regulator PNGRB's reported advice to the government to stipulate a uniform marketing margin for sellers of domestic gas, while giving free hand to sellers of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and firms selling CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.  The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), which was asked by the Oil Ministry to go into different rates of marketing margin charged in the country, submitted its recommendations on November 22.  Stating that the PNGRB Act does not discriminate between different forms of natural gas, RIL said domestic gas sellers have been transparently charging marketing margin in a narrow range as opposed to LNG/CNG operators charing much higher rates in an opaque manner.  Marketing margin is charged by sellers to cover costs and risks associated with marketing of natural gas. &amp;quot;Costs and risks are not uniform across all sectors. These depend upon the sharing of risks under Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPA), price of gas, associated costs etc,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Risk sharing in contracts for regulated gas produced from ONGC/OIL fields, called APM, cannot be compared with that of KG-D6 where sellers have taken substantially higher risks.  &amp;quot;It would be completely incorrect to have uniform marketing margin disregarding differences in associated costs and risks assumed by different entities,&amp;quot; it said.  RIL says state-owned GAIL has been levying marketing margin on the sale of non-APM gas in the range of 18-20 cents and more than 20 cents on imported LNG.  Marketing margin for KG-D6 gas has been agreed between buyers and sellers for five years as was the &amp;amp;#36;4.2 per mmBtu price of gas fixed by the government.  While the government has clearly said no to reopening of gas price before expiry of the five year signed period, acceptance of PNGRB recommendations would mean the signed contracts between buyers and sellers are reopened before the five year period.  RIL said there was no legal basis for the government to regulate marketing margin as it relates to costs and risks associated with marketing of gas beyond the delivery point, where the gas produced from a field is sold.

Also read: Sensex may see 22000 by March 2013, says Sanju Verma Harshad Deshpande: Which are your top five stock picks for short-term? A: I would buy Reliance Industries, Tata Steel, L&amp;amp;amp;T, M&amp;amp;amp;M and Bharti Airtel among the largecaps and Talwalkar, Mahindra Holidays, IL&amp;amp;amp;FS Transportation, Dishman Pharma, Exide and Jain Irrigation among the midcaps. Rahul Arora: I have 50 Apollo Tyres shares at Rs 93 each. What should I do?  A: Tyre stocks should be held for the next one-two years. There a couple of issues dogging the sector in the last few years &ndash; cheap imported tyres being dumped in India, rubber prices touching life time high. Most of the capacity was being used for OEM supplies to the vehicle manufacturers where the margins are comparatively low. Replacement market was yet to boom. The tyre prices were not keeping pace with the increase in input costs.  The scenario has changed in the last few months. Rubber prices have seen a steep decline and expected to remain soft. The replacement market is expected to boom with record number of vehicles sold in the last few years coming up for replacement of tyres. And the product prices need not be brought down in tandem with the raw material cost, thus contributing to increased margins.&amp;amp;nbsp; In addition to Apollo tyres, I would also suggest you to buy Ceat.  Manish Jain: What is your call on Unitech and L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance? A: Strangely market rewards those companies which try to correct their course after meandering into the wilderness. Same is the case with Unitech. It went overboard in the realty sector and built up highly leveraged balance sheet and got too ambitious to invest in an unrelated area like telecom. After having burnt their fingers, they are trying to find their way back into their core competence. Whether they would be successful or not, only time will tell. The market is currently giving them an initial thumbs up. The stock could move to about Rs 37/38, but to move beyond that, the sustainability of the revised model needs to be proved.  L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance is a much better bet, a known pedigree with deep pockets and following the right strategy. It is expected that L&amp;amp;amp;T group foray into banking would be through this entity. The stock has moved up sharply in the recent past, nearly a 100 percent appreciation. Hence, I would suggest you to wait for a correction. Chandrayee Sarkar: Is it right time to invest in Heritage Foods India Ltd? A: Not, after it has appreciated 100 percent in the last three months. Just because a savvy investor has bought at current levels does not merit a blind buy. Even savvy investors make mistakes. The branded retail story is taking shape, but wait for a correction to around Rs 400/410 levels.  Kishore Tirumala: I have 1,500 shares of GTL Infra at Rs 13? Can hold for long-term? A: GTL Infra could get some perk up due to Bharti Infratel IPO. The financials are in bad shape. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this as an investment. When you invest in a stock, you should first check whether the management is dependable or not. And there is no reason for us to believe this since the last 10 years.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Yousuf Sheikh: I just purchased Moser Baer for Rs 8.28. What is the prospect for this scrip? A: A company, which is into sectors such as storage media and solar power, which face rapid technology obsolescence and is unable to cope up with the same should be avoided at any cost, can only lead to destruction of shareholder wealth. We have seen that happening in the last few years. Don&rsquo;t expect any major change and thus avoid. Since most of the controversial stocks have started moving in the recent upmove, this could also show some positive move based on various rumours floating in the market. Utilise that and exit. Pankaj Srivastava: What is the six-month target of Bharti Airtel?  A: I expect Bharti to move to about Rs 360 in the next month or two. The government has slipped badly on the spectrum pricing and now they have decided to slash it further by another 30 percent. That is a moral victory for the telecom sector. Secondly, the Bharti Infratel issue could be another reason for the sentimental upmove on listing of the IPO. I also expect them to report better numbers in December as the rationalisation effort of the last few months will start paying dividends. Lastly tariff revision will be a trigger to take it up further. My six-month target is about 410 to 420."

BP had in July last year won government nod for investing USD 7.2 billion in taking 30 per cent interest in 21 oil and gas blocks of RIL including the gas discovery areas of KG-D6 and NEC-25 in Mahanadi basin. Also Read: LNG imports to surpass domestic production in 2 yrsNod for drilling well in Rajasthan may boost output: Cairn But it could not drill a single well till now because the Oil Ministry refused to give approvals. Sources privy to the development said a well on the D-19 field, also called Satellite-1 field, was spud on Sunday. The is part of the USD 1.529 billion plan to develop four satellite gas fields around the now producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 or D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in the Krishna Godavari basin KG-D6 block. The block oversight panel, called the Managing Committee headed the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons had on January 3 this year approved an optimised field development plan for the four satellite gas discoveries (D-2, D-6, D-19 and D-22) in KG-DWN-98/3 (or KG-D6) block. The approved plan envisaged drilling of 8 development gas wells. The development well KG-D6-G2 on the D-19 discovery is part of that plan, sources said. This will be first development well to be drilled since BP came into RIL's acreage. RIL-BP had lost the last four-month weather window available for drilling in Bay of Bengal as approvals did not come in time. They started spudding the well when the weather window opened this month. The approved development plan for the four satellite finds envisages a peak production of 10.30 million standard cubic meters per day. Output is projected to begin in mid-2016. The four fields will help augment output from the main D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields which have seen production drop from 55 mmscmd peak achieved in August 2010 to under 19 mmscmd currently. Water and sand ingress has led to closure of a third of the 18 producers on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3. Together with about 5 mmscmd output from MA oil and gas field in the same Krishna Godavari basin block, the current output is hovering around 23 mmscmd. RIL has till date made 18 gas and one oil find in the KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal. Of these, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas finds, were put on production in April 2009 while MA oil field came into production in September 2008. The four satellite fields and other discoveries are key to BP's plan for reversing the flagging output. The four finds have recoverable reserves of 617 billion cubic meters out of an in-place reserves of 1.343 trillion cubic feet."

The country's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which costs three times the price of domestic gas, is projected to rise exponentially over the next two-three years, according to latest projections made by the Oil Ministry. Imports of LNG or natural gas - cooled to its liquid form for ease of transporting in ships - at 39.32 million standard cubic meters a day constituted 25.5 per cent of the total consumption of the fuel in India in 2011-12. This share will rise to 41 per cent in current fiscal and to 50 per cent in the next, the ministry's projections showed. Also Read: Rangarajan panel report on oil, gas pricing in DecSell crude, natural gas; divided on gold: Experts  In 2012-13, domestic natural gas production is estimated to be around 104 mmscmd, down from 114.90 mmscmd in the previous fiscal primarily because KG-D6 output has slipped to 23 mmscmd from over 30 mmscmd last year. In current fiscal, LNG imports will jump to 73 mmscmd and are projected to further rise to 105 mmscmd in 2013-14, equalling the domestic gas production of that year. In 2014-15, imports at 115 mmscmd will surpass domestic production of 113 mmscmd, the ministry estimates said. For a nation whose current account deficit is already battered by 79 per cent reliance on imports for meeting oil needs, higher share of LNG is not be a good news. Industry officials said the domestic output has stagnated in absence of remunerative prices. UK's BP Plc, which partners RIL in the flagging KG-D6 gas block and other gas discovery areas, recently wrote to Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily saying around 5 trillion cubic feet of discoveries in KG-D6 and NEC-25 block in Mahanadi basin can be developed on price clarity. The reserves RIL-BP has are more than the remaining resource in state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp's fields. Majority of domestic natural gas is priced at USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit which is one-third the price at which LNG is imported by Petronet LNG Ltd and other firms. The government has been resisting revising the domestic prices fearing its impact on power tariffs and fertiliser cost even as KG-D6 output has plummeted to less than half to 24 mmscmd. Industry officials said that the world over countries have raised price for domestic produce. Last week, Argentina trippled wellhead price for new natural gas production to USD 7.50 per mmBtu. The South American nation too imported LNG at up to USD 15 per mmBtu rate, quite similar to the position in India. Neighbouring Pakistan too has announced a new exploration policy giving price of USD 7 for shallow water finds, USD 8 for deepsea discoveries and USD 9 for ultradeep exploration. China too has offered subsidises to energy companies who develop the nation's shale-gas resources."

RIL's Dubai-based subsidiary Reliance Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production DMCC &amp;quot;signed the completion documents for divestment of its 25 percent working interest in the Yemen's Block-9 to Medco Yemen Malik Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk of Indonesia,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement. The firm had announced the sale of its stake in the oil producing block in August. The stake sale followed RIL exiting from two oil blocks in Kurdistan region of Iraq on July 19. RIL had in 2001 won Yemen's Block 9 along with Hood Energy and Calvalley Petroleum Inc. RIL and Hood Energy held 25-percent stake each while Calvalley had the remaining 50percent. RIL said the sale agreement with Medco would be effective from January 1. While the agreement is for a 25 percent interest, Medco would effectively have a 21.25 percent participating interest in the block because, under a regulation in Yemen, the contractor of a production-sharing agreement has to accommodate a working interest for the country, which is represented by the Yemen Oil and Gas Company, which will hold a 15-percent stake. Accordingly, the operator Calvalley Petroleum would have 42.5-percent interest and Hood Oil a 21.25-percent stake. Block 9 lies covers 2,234 square kilometres in the Sayun- Masila basin in Yemen's Hadramaut province, about 350-km north-east of the Yemeni capital, Sana. It is estimated to hold proven plus probable reserves of 58.6 million barrels of oil. RIL would get another USD 5 million if the block produces 10,000 barrels of oil per day. The block currently produces between 6,000 bpd and 6,500 bpd. A 20-year construction contract was granted over the block by the Yemeni government in 2005 which the joint venture can apply to have extended for a further five years after 2025. After the sale, RIL will be left with interest in blocks 34 and 37 in eastern Yemen where is is investing USD 66 million with its patner Hood.  RIL had in July sold its 80-percent interest in Rovi and Sarta onland blocks in northern Iraq to US oil behemoth Chevron Corp for a reported USD 200 million.The exits are part of the company's overseas asset restructuring wherein it is cutting exposure in exploration blocks to focus on producing properties. After the exit from Kurdistan and Yemen, RIL now is left with a portfolio of 10 overseas oil and gas assets including two each in Peru, Yemen, Oman and Colombia and one each in East Timor and Australia.

RIL has at all times kept the government informed that the D1-D3 reservoir has thrown up unanticipated surprises and has shared all the relevant information and data,&amp;quot; he wrote, adding the company had on several occasions sought appointment of international experts to verify its claims so that &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; could be averted. Prasad said while, on the one hand, RIL has been accused of escalating costs and, on the other, it is being targeted for expending capital in drilling wells to increase production. &amp;quot;Four wells drilled after commencement of production in D1-D3 have conclusively proved that drilling additional wells would be infructuous. If the contractor (RIL) were really to benefit from escalating costs, we would have gone ahead and drilled all the wells demanded by DGH at an additional expense of nearly USD 2 billion,&amp;quot; he wrote. Instead, RIL has cut back on all infructuous expenditure and scaled down cost estimates by nearly USD 3 billion as all technical information now available showed that adding new wells in D1-D3 field would not add to production, he added."

RIL, however, says contractually there was no scope for CAG doing a performance audit and the scrutiny should be strictly a financial audit as has been promised by the Oil Ministry. RIL President and COO (Business) B Ganguly on July 16 wrote to the Oil Ministry saying the company &amp;quot;was agreeable for audit of Block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) by the CAG as per Section 1.9 of the Accounting Procedure to the Production Sharing Contract.&amp;quot; OilMin withdraws note opposing KG-D6 gas price hike by RIL &amp;quot;As agreed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, it will be a financial audit and conducted in compliance with various sub-sections of Section 1.9 and it will not be a performance audit,&amp;quot; he added. The company agreed to cooperate in the audit even if the exercise is conducted after a lapse of two years. The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) provides for audit within two year of the period being scrutinised and only under exceptional circumstances can it be done even after lapse of the mandated period. RIL, he said, did not agree with the reasons given by the ministry as constituting exceptional circumstances for audit of time barred years but &amp;quot;as a gesture of cooperation&amp;quot; it has agreed to CAG doing the audit of spendings during 2008-09 to 2011-12 as an exception. The firm had previously stated that CAG cannot do a audit of time-barred periods and that the audit report be submitted to the Oil Ministry, as provided under PSC, and not to Parliament. Also, it wanted CAG to maintain confidentiality of the information shared and not make them public. CAG had strongly contested the conditions and the Oil Ministry too had been pressing RIL to give CAG &amp;quot;unfettered access to account books&amp;quot;. RIL, in the November 16 letter, referred to meetings held with the Oil Ministry to state that the company has been emphasising that &amp;quot;the report shall be kept confidential as required by the PSC&amp;quot;. CAG, it said, can conduct audit/special performance audit of the ministry or the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) after the audit process under the PSC was completed. Stating that RIL had assured cooperation in such an exercise, Ganguly said &amp;quot;as agreed such performance audit of the Ministry/DGH would not be mixed with the audit of the contractor's (RIL's) accounting books and records which will be an independent standalone audit.&amp;quot; Also, RIL &amp;quot;would not be subjected to any adverse implication of its economic interest as a result of the performance audit of the Ministry/DGH,&amp;quot; he added."

It is struggling to clear resistances. It remained listless on Thursday. Investors were sceptical due to stormy beginning of the winter session of Parliament. The Sensex was up 56.96 points to close at 18,517.34. Meanwhile, the Nifty rose 12.95 points and ended at 5,627.75. Moneycontrol brings to you some of the recommendations given by experts that will help you cash in on the many opportunities available. Stocks picks for today: Sudarshan Sukhani, s2analytics.com is bullish on Union Bank of India. &amp;quot;The stock had a fantastic rally from Rs 150 to Rs 230 and then went through a brief decline. That decline is over now. It is now resuming its uptrend. This uptrend should take it to new highs. It&rsquo;s a good stock,&amp;quot; he elaborates.  Sukhani has a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; call on Britannia Industries. &amp;quot;Sometimes the blue chip stocks gives significant and stupendous breakouts all of a sudden, maybe Britannia will do it, if not today, next week. It&rsquo;s readily poised for that. It has made a bullish head and shoulder pattern, after a small correction,&amp;quot; he asserts. Sukhani is also betting on Coal India. &amp;quot;The stock went through a correction and then it stopped falling. That itself was a first sign that this is not a bear market. It is not a deep correction, it&rsquo;s a shallow correction and then we have seen a double bottom. That&rsquo;s a very interesting pattern because normally double bottom comes after big declines, but this one has come on a small correction. It is not willing to go up. So, I could sometime classify it as a micro double bottom, a small pattern, but it has bullish overtones. So, one buy it. If the market is willing to go up today Coal India could be a major contributor.&amp;quot;  Also read: Is it time to look at sugar stocks? Brokerage calls: Stock: Bharti Airtel Brokerage: UBS Rating: Buy Target: Rs 425 Rationale: The stock looks well positioned to gain from the inflection in pricing and regulatory landscape in the Indian telecom space. The realisations per minute are likely to improve significantly due to a reduction in free promotional minutes and headline tariff increases. Stock: HUL Brokerage: Macquarie Rating: Outperform Target: Rs 620 Rationale: The stock has corrected 10 percent, since earnings, due to concerns on sales growth fatigue in the personal products category. However, the company's recent initiatives suggest that the growth uptrend will persist. Stock: Reliance Industries Brokerage: CLSA Rating: Outperform Target: Rs 850 Rationale: Singapore GRM benchmarks have fallen up to USD 2.5 per barrel QoQ and this has impacted the stock. However, their Reliance GRM tracker is up over USD 1 per barrel QoQ on the back of improvement in spreads of Naphtha and LPG as well as lower input costs due to rise in light heavy crude spreads and severe decline in fuel oil spread. They say this should allow reliance to outperform benchmark GRMs in Q3. _PAGEBREAK_ Stock: NTPC Brokerage: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Rating: Underperform Target: Rs 153 Rationale: The 9.5 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;stake sale by the government is a potential overhang, given the weak execution and its rich valuation. Stock: GSK Pharma Brokerage: Nomura Rating: Underperform Target: Rs 1,795 Rationale: Under the new pharma pricing policy cleared by the Cabinet, the prices of essential drugs are likely to fall by 15-20 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;versus earlier expectations of 8-12 percent. GSK Pharma will be the worst hit due to the new policy. Stock: Tata Steel Brokerage: JPMorgan Rating: Overweight Target: Rs 530 Rationale: According to them, the price hikes in Europe atleast signal that steel prices have likely bottomed out, and from here price hike announcements by various companies, should allow re-stocking demand to come back. They see that the benefits of this flowing into Tata Steel's Q4 numbers. Stock: Cipla Brokerage: CLSA Rating: Outperform Target: Rs 400 Rationale: They say Cipla's proposal to acquire 51 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;of Cipla Medpro for USD 220 million seems attractive for Cipla India as the latter could drive synergies between two entities, considering it has been manufacturing partner for Medpro for decades. The acquisition is reasonably valued at 1.7x price to sales, 11x trailing earnings and provides Cipla direct footing in South African branded generic market. Stock: Sun Pharma Brokerage: Nomura Rating: Neutral Target: Rs 690 Rationale: They believe the new proposal to cap prices based on the arithmetic average is incrementally negative, although they say it is unlikely to be materially disruptive. The earlier proposal impacted the FY14 base business EBIDTA of Cadila, Ranbaxy&amp;amp;nbsp;and Cipla by 5-8 percent and 3&amp;amp;nbsp;percent for Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy's. The new proposal will have higher negative impact of 6-10 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;for Cadila, Ranbaxy and Cipla and up to 5 percent&amp;amp;nbsp;EBITDA impact for Sun, Lupin and Dr Reddy's."

Rather it has been seeking clarity on the basis of gas pricing that will be adopted post March 2014,&amp;quot; company Executive Director P M S Prasad said. The government had in 2007 approved USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit as the price of KG-D6 gas for first five years of production. KG-D6 began pumping gas from April, 2009. Prasad said the formula used to arrive at the current gas price was submitted to the government for approval in April 2007, a full two years before the gas production commenced. The government slightly modified the formula and approved a price of USD 4.2 per mmBtu in October. RIL's request for a new price for KG-D6 from April 2014 follows the same pattern of giving time to the government to debate and decide. &amp;quot;To make investment decisions to bring gas from new developments after 2014, it is necessary that approval for gas prices are similarly obtained now,&amp;quot; Prasad said. &amp;quot;This clarity is required because the contractor partners have to make significant investments to develop various new discoveries.&amp;quot; Dismissing reports that RIL is seeking a three-fold hike in gas price, he said, &amp;quot;Some vested interests were trying to create a needless controversy on the issue.&amp;quot; Prasad said as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), RIL is contractually bound to sell all gas produced from the block at arms-length prices to the benefit of all the parties to the PSC. &amp;quot;In early 2012, arms-length prices for gas in the country were higher than the price approved by Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) in 2007. RIL was receiving numerous offers from buyers seeking to purchase gas at prices higher than those approved,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;quot;As per the provisions of the PSC, RIL was constrained to bring the willingness of buyers to pay higher gas price, to the notice of the Government and seek its directions.&amp;quot; But since then the company has not been pushing for any revision in rates before expiry of current prices in end of March 2014. &amp;quot;The price of gas determines not just the share of the contractor but also the revenues flowing to the Government as royalty, profit share and taxes,&amp;quot; he added.

The new rating follows the recent correction in the stock, which is now quoting around Rs 765, below Kotak's target price of Rs 775. &amp;quot;We see near-term headwinds for RIL's core businesses from (1) lower refining margins, (2) subdued chemical margins and (3) a sharp decline in KG-D6 production. Value creation from RIL&rsquo;s new projects is 3-4 years away and will depend on (1) assumptions of conversion margins and (2) incremental gas production,&amp;quot; Kotak analysts Sanjeev Prasad, Tarun Lakhotia and Vinay Kumar wrote in their note. According to the trio, the only upside trigger for the stock is if the government agrees to the company's proposal to raise price of its gas from the KG-D6 block, before April 1, 2014. The report estimates that refining margins will be subdued over the next 12-18 months due to likely large net additions to global refining capacity and weak oil demand resulting from a global slowdown. Also, Prasad and his team see downside risks to the management guidance on FY2013-15 production from KG-D6. &amp;quot;A reversal of decline in production from a revised development plan for the producing fields and incremental production from approved satellite fields is unlikely before FY2016-17E. Development work may also be delayed further due to the ongoing issues with the Government on (1) gas pricing, (2) scope of the CAG audit and (3) cost recovery,&amp;quot; the report said. Kotak Securities expects the stock to get support in the Rs 725-775 range because of the ongoing share buyback program."

In a surprise move, the Ministry had on October 10 moved a note to the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) opposing a hike in price of RIL's KG-D6 gas before April 2014 even though the company itself was not seeking a revision before that date. &amp;quot;Yes, the note to EGoM has been withdrawn,&amp;quot; a top ministry official said. This was done in view of panel haded by Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council Chairman C Rangarajan being asked to suggest &amp;quot;structure and elements of the guidelines for determining the basis or formula for the price of domestically produced gas, and for monitoring actual price fixation.&amp;quot; Prime Minister had appointed the six-member panel to essentially look at the design of future contracts for exploration of of oil and gas. It had also been tasked to suggest pricing of natural gas. Sources said the Ministry had in the October 10 note to EGoM members argued that a higher price of KG-D6 gas would result in USD 6.3 billion rise in subsidy burden. RIL, it said, would get an additional USD 4.1 billion revenue if the rates are hiked from current USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit to import parity rates of USD 14.2-14.51 per mmBtu. The government on the other hand would get only USD 0.5 billion at current year production level of around 25 million standard cubic metres per day. Sources said the ministry stated that a USD 10 rise in gas price would result in increase in subsidy paid on fertiliser and power by USD 6.3 billion. The Ministry, however, in the note did not state that RIL had modified its January request for a price revision to clearly state it is seeking rate revision only from April 1, 2014 when the current price is due to expire. RIL first in June and then again on September 6 reiterated its demand for a price at par with the rate India is paying for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from April 1, 2014 when the current five-year period of USD 4.2 price expires. It wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. At USD 110 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 14.23 per mmBtu. Sources said the company has also proposed to price gas it plans to produce from coal seams, called coal-bed methane (CBM), from Sohagpur blocks in Madhya Pradesh according to the same formula. Its CBM pricing formula as well as Essar Oil's demand for USD 4.2 per mmBtu price of CBM from its Raniganj block in West Bengal had been referred Rangarajan for review."

The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) on November 2 wrote to the Joint Secretary (Exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that one development well KG-D6-G2 in the Dhirubhai-19 or D-19 field may be agreed. D-19 is one of the four satellite gas field whose optimised field development plan (OFDP) was approved in January this year, the DGH wrote. &amp;quot;Approved OFDP envisaged eight development gas wells with a peak gas production level of 10.30 million standard cubic meters per day,&amp;quot; it said. RIL has till date made 18 gas and one oil find in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal. Of these, Dhirubhai-1 and 3, the largest of the 18 gas finds, were put on production in April 2009 while MA oil field came into production in September 2008.

High water and sand ingress has forced RIL to shut six out of the 18 wells on the fields. MA field has seen output drop for the same reasons from over 8 mmscmd to 5.05 mmscmd. In a separate letter, the DGH advised RIL &amp;quot;to monitor the water/gas ratio closely and adopt suitable measures in case of deviation from the envisaged profile.&amp;quot; The satellite fields are key to RIL reversing the flagging output from the KG-D6 block. The company had in July, 2008, submitted a FDP to exploit reserves of 1,708 billion cubic feet (bcf) in nine satellite gas discoveries (D-2, D-4, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-16, D-19, D-22 and D-23) in the D6 block at an estimated capex of USD 5.91 billion. This, the DGH found, was not techno-economically viable. Thereafter, RIL submitted OPDPF for four satellite (D-2, 6, 9 and 22) gas discoveries on December 19, 2009. A peak gas production rate of 10.30 mmscmd is envisaged from the four where recoverable reserves are estimated at 617 billion cubic meters out of an inplace reserves of 1.343 tcf. DGH said the OFDP was approved by the KG-D6 block oversight panel, called the Management Committee on January 3 this year. This envisages commencement of gas supply from mid-2016, it added. RIL's proposal to invest up to USD 2.338 billion to produce about 15 mmscmd of gas from D-24, or the R-Series gas field in the same block is also pending approval.

The ministry's argument is that if gas price is hiked from current USD 4.2 million British thermal unit to import parity rates of USD 14.51 per mmBtu, RIL would certainly get an additional USD 4.1 billion revenues.

At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu.  The formula proposed by the energy giant is the same at which Petronet LNG, the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer, buys 7.5 million tonnes per annum (30 million standard cubic metres per day) of LNG from RasGas of Qatar.  Meanwhile, according to the Rangarajan committee, the share of profit to the government should commence from the first day of production instead of the existing one where profits start when all costs have been recovered. It has also recommended that the revenue which the contractor will earn even after this should be shared with the government. The committee is expected to submit its final report&amp;amp;nbsp;by December. RIL has stated that government is not entitled to fix and regulate gas prices and if it forces that company to do so, it would be against the production sharing contract document, which it had signed with the government when it was awarded blocks off the KG-D6 coast. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

The bidding for the airwaves is scheduled to start from November 12. The telecom industry had been seeking further easing of the ECB norms as banks are reluctant to lend money to the sector.  In order to develop the telecom sector, the government in January 2010 had provided a window of 12 months to successful bidders for the 2G auction for refinancing the rupee loan from domestic lenders to make payment for spectrum allocation with a long-term ECB under the approval route. &amp;quot;Keeping in view the large outlay of funds required to be paid directly to the government within a limited period of time, relaxation has been provided for the upcoming 2G auction,&amp;quot; the official added. Finance ministry official said that bidders could also avail of short-term currency loans in the nature of bridge-finance under the automatic route for making upfront payment towards 2G spectrum allocation and replace it with long-term ECB under the automatic route, subject to certain terms and conditions. Next week, the government is auctioning spectrum at a minimum bid price of Rs 14,000 crore for 5 MHz of airwaves across 22 telecom zones. The auction-based price is more than seven times that the carriers paid in earlier sales where airwaves were bundled with telecom permits. Airtel and Vodafone are among the telecom gianta that have applied to bid in the auction, but Reliance Industries and Russia's Sistema surprised by staying away. Airtel and main rival Vodafone have only bid for additional spectrum in select few circles. Other players in the fray are Videocon, Telenor and Idea. The Reserve Bank, the official said, would soon be issuing the detailed guidelines for relaxing the ECB norms."

RIL has so far made four consecutive gas discoveries in the KG-DWN-2003/1 (D3) block that sits in the same area as its now producing KG-D6 gas fields. Of these four finds, two have so far not been declared commercial by the government, a step necessary before they can be put to production. &amp;quot;A revised proposal for the declaration of commerciality (DOC) for the Dhirubhai 39 and 41 natural gas discoveries, submitted earlier this year, remained under review by the government,&amp;quot; Hardy said in its Interim Management Statement. RIL, which is the operator of the block with 60 per cent interest, has so far made four consecutive gas discoveries -- Dhirubhai 39, 41, 44 and 52 in the block. Hardy holds 10 per cent interest while the rest 30 per cent is held by BP Plc. &amp;quot;The government of India's review of the D3 DOC proposal will likely continue into 2013,&amp;quot; Hardy said. Once DoC is approved, RIL-BP-Hardy will put together a field development plan to bring the finds to production. &amp;quot;The proposed development plan provides for a dry gas, sub-sea cluster development with the flexibility to add in additional wells and to include possible adjoining area of discoveries,&amp;quot; Hardy said. Situated in the Krishna Godavari Basin, a prolific petroleum province on the East coast of India, the D3 exploration licence encompasses an area of 3,288 square kilometers and is located approximately 45 km offshore. RIL has contracted deep-water drillship Dhirubhai Deepwater KG2 to drill a fifth exploration well on the block. The rig is expected to arrive in Indian waters by the end of the year and drilling of the well is expected to commence in the first half of 2013, Hardy said. &amp;quot;Through 2013 we will continue to collaborate actively with our partners RIL and BP to optimise the exploration programme for this highly prospective block,&amp;quot; it said. Processing of 3D seismic data covering the eastern area of the D3 block is also expected to be completed by the end of 2012. About 3,250 sq km of 3D seismic data over the block has already been acquired. RIL will continue to undertake a number of geotechnical studies, which have been focused on assessing the potential of the eastern area of the block and high grading prospects, including testing deeper play types, Hardy said. &amp;quot;The KG Basin is a world-class petroleum province and together with rapidly improving Indian gas pipeline infrastructure and the high demand for gas, the prospects for the economic development of gas resources in this area are excellent,&amp;quot; it added."

A: At this stage, one should go for a judicious mix of gold and equity.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the bias should be towards equity. While gold has appreciated significantly over the last 12-18 months, there exists scope for further gradual appreciation in gold price over medium to long-term.&amp;amp;nbsp; Thus, parking anywhere between 10 to 20% of surplus in gold may be advised.  On the other hand, inspite of recent run-up in the equity, there exists significant opportunity of value buying even at current levels.&amp;amp;nbsp; With growth momentum slowly coming back in the economy, it is expected that equity market will also gain traction over the next 6-12 months.&amp;amp;nbsp; Ofcourse, one needs to be careful in selecting stocks and identifying sectors.  Harsha Jethmalani: Should any correction in Reliance Industries (RIL) be seen as an opportunity to buy? A: Reliance Industries is a good buy for long-term.&amp;amp;nbsp; The company is in right businesses with lots of liquidity.&amp;amp;nbsp; Though at present few of their businesses are under pressure, in the medium to long-term, RIL will surely outperform the market. However, it should be also understood that in the short-term RIL will continue to remain volatile.  Ravi Cheke: What is your call on Canara Bank, State Bank of India and Axis Bank? A:&amp;amp;nbsp; One needs to be cautious while selecting stocks in the banking sector.&amp;amp;nbsp; The stress in the economy is getting reflected in the asset quality of banks. PSU banks are definitely more affected compared to their private sector peers.  At current valuation, Canara Bank, State Bank of India and even Axis Bank look attractive for long-term.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the overall non-performing asset (NPA) situation, the changing provisioning norms and the economic uncertainties, prevents us from recommending investment in this space at this point of time.  Joel Peter Lobo: What about L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance, JSW Steel and NTPC? A: With long-term perspective, exposure can be taken in L&amp;amp;amp;T Finance and NTPC .&amp;amp;nbsp; Infact, NTPC is a good buy at current level with medium to long-term perspective.&amp;amp;nbsp; NTPC is the largest and most efficient power producer with better backend and frontend tie-ups (i.e. coal linkages and SEB buyback arrangements).  Globally, the steel industry is going through a huge turmoil with significant reduction in demand from China and various other developed markets.&amp;amp;nbsp; Global steel companies are underperforming the benchmark indices.&amp;amp;nbsp; In case of JSW Steel, there are further company specific regulatory and operational adversities.&amp;amp;nbsp; Thus, it is advisable to avoid taking exposure in JSW Steel at this stage.  Alpesh Patel: I have 500 shares of Reliance Capital at Rs 410. What should I do now? A: While the valuation looks attractive, considering price correction that has taken place in this counter over the last couple of years, the overall economic and business environment does not support any rationale for buying.&amp;amp;nbsp; The company&rsquo;s wish to obtain banking license may not bear immediate fruit, and that may act as a dampener to the sentiment in the counter, in the near future. Manish Mittal: Is Electrosteel a good option for long-term investment? A: With long-term perspective, exposure can be taken in Electrosteel.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, it should be noted that current turmoil in the global steel industry affects even special steel manufacturers.&amp;amp;nbsp; Thus, in the short-term, no miracle should be expected from this scrip.  Prashant Jain Barar: I have Reliance Power at Rs&amp;amp;nbsp; 202.&amp;amp;nbsp; What I shoud do? A: At an opportune moment, you can switch from Reliance Power to NTPC.&amp;amp;nbsp; This will enable you to reduce execution risk from your power portfolio.  Chandan Salaskar: What is the future of Union Bank of India?  A: The future of Union Bank is good.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the current economic environment, existing asset quality pressure, provisioning norms and near-term economic outlook does not support investment rationale in PSU banking space at present.  Prabhat Manohar Tamhankar: Is Marico a 'buy' now? A: Investment can be made in Marico with medium to long-term perspective. In the short-term, the counter may be volatile as few key raw material prices may fluctuate in the near future.  Sunil Pareek: What about UCO Bank? A: The future of UCO Bank is good.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, the current economic environment, existing asset quality pressure, provisioning norms and near-term economic outlook does not support investment rationale in PSU banking space at present.  Mukul Mansinghka: Which real estate stock would you suggest now? A: Out of real estate stocks, investment in Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty is recommended with medium-long tem perspective.&amp;amp;nbsp; Aggressive investors can also explore investments in Orbit Corporation.  Apart from everything, the quality of management, corporate governance, business practices etc. should be critically examined prior to taking exposure in real estate counters.  Abhinandan Jain: What is your view on Housing Development and Infrastructure (HDIL) now? A: Investment in HDIL is not recommended considering the current economic environment and company specific issues.&amp;amp;nbsp; Short-term price appreciation may happen due to multiple factors.&amp;amp;nbsp; However, medium-long term view in this counter is uncertain and will be contingent upon multiple factors both macro and micro."

RIL has sought written assurance that CAG scrutiny would be an &amp;quot;audit of accounting books and records&amp;quot; as provided under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and that the company would not be &amp;quot;required to provide documents, information or any clarification of matters which go beyondscope of audit under Section 1.9 of the Accounting Procedure of the PSC.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Also, it wants the audit to be carried at its premises and audit report be submitted to the Oil Ministry, as provided under PSC, and not to the Parliament.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The Ministry, however, wants RIL to give CAG &amp;quot;unfettered access to account books&amp;quot; and pending that it has not approved the company's investment proposals including annual budget for past three years.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Sources said the kick-off meeting was postponed so as to resolve these differences.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The Ministry had on October 23 written to RIL saying CAG would not do a performance audit of the company and that &amp;quot;all the government nominees&amp;quot; on the KG-D6 block oversight panel have &amp;quot;already approved&amp;quot; to all the development proposals made by RIL.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Sources, however, said the resolution approving annual capital expenditure on the KG-D6 block for 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13 fiscal have not been signed yet.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; While the Management Committee of KG-D6 block on August 7 approved annual capex plans pending for past three years, the resolution had not been signed. These capex included those on well interventions to reverse the trend of falling gas output.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Pending signing is the MC approved revised field development plan for MA oil and gas field in the same block. All these investments, RIL says, are necessary to reverse drop in output at the fields.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Also, at least three discoveries RIL has made in the block had not been declared commercial, a step necessary to begin production from them. _PAGEBREAK_ Sources said the investment approvals withheld include USD 805 million RIL already spent in 2010-11 and another USD 532 million invested in 2011-12. A budget of USD 1.096 billion for current fiscal is also pending approval, sources added.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3, the first two of the 18 discoveries that have been put on production, started declining from a plateau level of about 55 million standard cubic meters per day in August 2010. It is currently around 20 mmscmd.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Six out of the 18 wells on the field have been shut due to high water and sand ingress.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; KG-D6 is currently producing around 26 mmscmd after including output from the MA field.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Sources said the Ministry on October 23 wrote to RIL saying, &amp;quot;...the proposed audit would be under Section 1.9 of the Accounting Procedure of the Production Sharing Contract, and not a performance audit of the operator (RIL).&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; On the same day, the ministry also wrote to Principal Director of Audit (Economic &amp;amp;amp; Service Ministries), CAG stating that &amp;quot;subject to certain conditions, RIL has agreed for an audit under Sector 1.9 of Accounting Procedure to the PSC by CAG and to cooperate with such audit without prejudice to any of their rights and contentions.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; RIL had stated that it was ready for a CAG audit if done under the PSC which provides for checking of the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits but not questioning efficacies of processes or technology used in the complex deepsea operations.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The company last month had stated that said CAG's 2009 audit, which it had agreed to as a one-time exception, turned out to be a 'performance' audit which was contrary to the provisions of the PSC.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The CAG had in its first round of audit questioned the 'reasonableness' of costs incurred in the gas field development and said the government should revisit the profit sharing mechanism."

The well G-1-9 in Bay of Bengal has been leaking gas since August-end and all efforts by ONGC to contain the flow have so far been futile. &amp;quot;This is a very old, drilled some eight or 10 years back. It wasn't producing till now and we had plans to put in on production sometime next year along with other gas finds in the area,&amp;quot; a company official said. However, an uncontrolled flow of gas started from the well around August 30. After attempting in-house solutions, the company is now looking at outside specalists to cap the well. There are fears that the well may start spilling oil too, which may spell environmental disaster.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;We have no idea how much gas (mostly methane) might have spilled but I suppose it must be at least one lakh cubic meters per day,&amp;quot; the official said.&amp;amp;nbsp;  ONGC is developing G-1 field along with neighbouring GS-15. Both the fields are marginal or small finds. G-1-9 well was part of this development through which ONGC had planned to produce 2.7 million standard cubic meters of gas and 9,400 barrels of associated oil daily. The official said The company has sought help of Coast Guard and Navy as well as neighbouring operators like Reliance Industries-BP combine and Cairn India to control the gas leak.&amp;amp;nbsp; ONGC had in the integrated development of G-1 and GS-15 targeted to produce 0.982 million tonnes of oil and 5.92 billion cubic meters of gas by 2020-21. The project at the time of conception in 2003 was to cost Rs 429.82 crore but the cost was subsequently revised to Rs 1,262.93 crore in 2004 and then to Rs 2218.01 crore in 2010.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The company had planned to being production from the fields by April-May but the gas spill may result in delays, he said adding drilling on GS-15 field was completed last August.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The project had time and cost overrun as the contactor (Clough Ltd of Australia) defaulted in work. ONGC terminated the contract in June 2006.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  Of the two, G1 is a deepwater field and is located 20 km away from the shore. GS15 is a shallow water field. G1 was the first deepwater field to be developed by ONGC."

The new minister has made it clear that he will look at addressing RIL&rsquo;s plea to up gas prices before 2014--a move that was strongly resisted by the erstwhile oil ministry. RIL has repeatedly said that the process of price discovery should be allowed as per the provisions in the production sharing contract (PSC) which allows contractors discover through an open and transparent bidding process at arms-length price of gas. The discovered rate, which as estimated by RIL to be around USD 12.93 per mmbtu is much higher than the current rate of USD 4.2 mmbtu and is due for revision only in April 2014. In June, it had modified this to seek a rate equivalent to the price India pays for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from April 1, 2014 when the current price is due to expire. RIL is seeking to price KG--D6 gas at 12.67 percent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu.  The formula proposed by RIL is the same at which Petronet LNG Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp; , the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer, buys 7.5 million tonnes per annum (30 million standard cubic metres per day) of LNG from RasGas of Qatar.  Sources said RIL may be asked to invite bids from the customers, particularly power and fertiliser, to find if their is enough demand at this price. If demand equivalent to KG-D6 output or more is generated then this rate could be approved. However, analysts say that though the market has reacted positively to the development, it is a wait and watch situation as of now. &ldquo;The announcement is surely a big positive for RIL, but how soon the minister can bring about changes cannot be ascertained so soon&rdquo; said Mayur Patel from Spark Capital. &amp;quot;Sentiment-wise this would be positive, as with the earlier minister approvals were not coming on time. Talks between the company and the ministry may improve,&amp;quot; said an industry analyst at a large domestic brokerage, who declined to be identified.V.K Vijayakumar, Investment strategist at Geogit BNP Paribas, said Moily may fast track some approvals. &amp;quot;Further approval regarding the joint application by Reliance Industries and BP for KG-D6 gas might get expedited, that is one possibility,&amp;quot; he said.  Moody's Investors Service said the approval was a positive development for Reliance's credit profile as it signalled an improvement in a &amp;quot;thorny&amp;quot; relationship.  &amp;quot;If this improvement in relations between RIL and the government of India continues, we expect both sides to also reach a decision on gas prices,&amp;quot; Moody's said in a weekly report on Monday, which made no mention of the change of oil minister.

Net profit improved by 21% y-o-y, mainly due to higher other income and posted better refining margins of &amp;amp;#36;9.5/bbl. Net sales improved by 15% to Rs 90,335 cr on Y-o-Y largely due to higher prices of products and increase in volume. Other income was higher at Rs2,112 cr as against Rs 1,345 cr on a y-o-y basis primarily due to higher average liquid investments of Rs 79,159cr. Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas: 37% Dip in revenue on Y-o-Y basis and ~10% on Q-o-Q basis to Rs 2,254cr mainly due to fall in production to the level of 28.8 mmscmd (AvgQ2FY13) and natural decline continue in PMT field. Weaker rupee helped to realize 20% higher revenue in rupee term on Y-o-Y basis. RIL continues to highlight that complexity of reservoir and higher water cut have been causing the production decline. Oil and gas production from PMT fields was also down ~9% and ~6% Q-o-Q respectively; these fields are in natural decline. In order to ramp-up production over the next three to four years, RIL is focusing on KG D6, NEC-25, Panna-Mukta-Tapti and coal bed methane blocks. In August 2012,RIL-BP submitted a revised field development plan for currently producing D1-D3 fields to the Management Committee. This revised FDP calls for installation of increased water handling capacity and additional compression capacity over the next 2-3 years to address the decline in reservoir pressure. RIL believes this will help it to increase the reserve life of current producing fields. Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing: Revenue increased by 23% on y-o-y basis to Rs 83,878cr in Q2FY13. Increase in revenue principally due to higher price environment of products (18%) and increase in volume accounted by 1.4%.

Sources privy to the development said the PMO stated that the process of price discovery may be allowed as per the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The PSC provides for contractors like RIL discovering through an open and transparent bidding process an arms-length price of gas. The so discovered rate is then put to the government for approval.

ONGC has made nine gas discoveries in its KG block KG-DWN-98/2, which sits next to RIL's flagging KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. It plans to club these finds with discoveries in another neighbouring block to begin gas production from2016-17. And instead of putting separate gas processing and transportation facilities, ONGC is looking to hire RIL's under-utilised gas gathering station at KG-D6 fields along with pipelines that take the fuel to onland as also its processing plant at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, ONGC chairman and managing director Sudhir Vasudeva said in Mumbai on Sunday.  &amp;quot;We have started talking to them on that...they (RIL) are open to that,&amp;quot; Vasudeva said. &amp;quot;It makes lot of economic sense to share the infrastructure.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp; RIL has pipeline and other offshore and onshore facilities capable of handling gas output of 80 million standard cubic metres per day. It is however producing just around 26 mmscmd from the KG-D6 lock which is way below the peak production of 61.5 mmscmd reached in March 2010. &amp;quot;It makes sense to all of us. Their (RIL) facilities are lying redundant and we are in need of infrastructure to produce our gas,&amp;quot; Vasudeva said. RIL has indicated that KG-D6 production may not touch 80 mmsmcd due to unexpected geological complexities. &amp;quot;Once we have a clear indication of what capacities RIL can offer, we will firm up our plans,&amp;quot; he said. Globally, oil companies share infrastructure to cut costs on transmission of gas and crude. ONGC has found 4.85 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in nine gas discoveries it has made in the Krishna-Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/2.  &amp;quot;The block is targetted for production by 2016-17 and a peak production of 22 mmscmd is envisaged,&amp;quot; Vasudeva said. Gas from these is proposed to be produced by combining them with a gas discovery in the adjacent block, he said. G-4 gas discovery in a neighbouring block is planned to be developed along with finds in the Northern Discovery Area of KG-DWN-98/2.  Once the government approves the commercial viability of the finds, ONGC will make a formal field development plan (FDP) outlining the specifics of producing gas from the find.  The Northern Discovery Area (NDA) consists of the Padmawati, Kanakadurga, Annapurna, D/KT, U, A, W and E gas finds in in water depths ranging from 594 metres to 1,283 metres. The Southern Discovery Area (SDA)&amp;amp;nbsp;consisting of the UD-1 discovery falls in ultra-deepwater with a depth of 2,841 metres.  He said ONGC has time till November 2013 to apprise the discoveries. The firm plans to drill eight wells to appraise or re-ascertain the commerciality of the finds - six in NDA and two in SDA. The appraisal has begun, he said.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;We are in the process of hiring a rig.

Below is Goyal's response. Sandeep Rao: Can you suggest stocks for one-year investment? A: LIC Housing Finance is in long term uptrend and have corrected to decent levels. It can be bought for a one-year perspective. Its financials are also supportive particularly studying last five years trend. FMCG stocks have also outperformed the benchmark indices and may be bought in dips, like ITC, HUL and Dabur. Among the banking stocks, Indusind Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank can be bought for long term.&amp;amp;nbsp;Kiran Pratapsinh Kadam: Can I buy Reliance Industries at current levels? A: Reliance Q2FY13 results have been disappointing and have led to the recent fall. It has support near 760 levels. Buying near support levels is likely to give returns in near term.&amp;amp;nbsp;Harsimran Singh: What is your view on Steel Authority of India (SAIL)? A: SAIL is showing weak trend in long term. Steel sector in general is also showing weakness due to sluggish economy. My advise is buying should&amp;amp;nbsp;be deferred for now.&amp;amp;nbsp;Manan Maheshwari: What about State Bank of India? A: SBI's NPA have been a matter of concern in the last quarterly results. This may also continue in this quarter and hence post Q2 results, if it disappoints the market, selling may be seen. Fresh buying&amp;amp;nbsp; should be considered only above 2365 levels or in dips near 2100-2050 levels.&amp;amp;nbsp;Manjunath Ramachandra: Is Bharti Airtel a 'buy' now? A: Bharti Airtel has been seeing a decline in subscribers since last 10 years which is not a good indicator for growth. Along with this, telecom sector is impacted by government policies. The recent one being imposing a one-time fee on mobile operators holding spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz. Technically too, buying may be seen only above 285 levels.&amp;amp;nbsp;Chandrayee Sarkar: What is your one-year view on HDFC Bank? A: With consistent fundamental performance by the bank, we feel it can reach target of 750 in one year. Shramnesh Jain: What is your three-month view on Jaiprakash Associates and Tata Motors? A: JP Associate's Q1FY13 results had not impressed the market. Particularly the decline in sales volume had affected the net profits. Technically it is showing strength, however, upside seems to be limited till 100 level. Considering the slow pace in economy Q2 results are also likely to be impacted. Tatamotors also the same case. It had seen decline in sales volumes in Q1FY13 and profit margins were also hit. For both stocks , we recommend caution in medium term.&amp;amp;nbsp;Devabrata Patra: Can I buy Reliance Capital at current price? A: Yes it can be bought at current levels, for likely target of Rs 860. Keep strict stoploss below Rs 780.&amp;amp;nbsp;Sweta Das: What is your call on Axis Bank?

Also Read: Reliance Ind objects to second round of CAG audit The complexity of these plants allows the refiner to continuously diversify its crude slate by testing new grades and improve refining margins. The company reported a gross refining margin of USD 9.50 a barrel for the September quarter, up from USD 7.60 a barrel in the previous quarter, helped by higher demand and unplanned refinery shutdowns in Asia. No comment was available from Reliance. &amp;quot;Canadian heavy oil mostly likely Cold Lake came in a combi cargo with Ecuador's Oriente grade,&amp;quot; said one of the sources. He said the price of the Canadian heavy oil bought from PetroChina is linked to Dubai. Reliance processed eight new crudes for the first time in the last fiscal year ending March 31, as it always looks for economical feedstock, the company said in its annual report for 2011-12 which is posted on its website. Weightage of heavy grades from the Latin American region may rise significantly from the current about 30 percent as the private refiner last month signed a deal with Venezuela's PDVSA to buy between 300,000-400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil."

Under the existing Production Sharing Contracts (PSC), like the one RIL had signed for KG-D6 in 2000, companies are first allowed to recover all their cost before government gets its share of profit. This system had come in for sharp criticism from even the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which said it incentivised companies by going on investing in oil and gas fields.  &amp;quot;We have found it too difficult (to manage) the issue of cost recovery,&amp;quot; DGH R N Choubey told reporters at the Petrotech 2012 conference when asked about the provisions of the existing PSC. &amp;quot;It is difficult to assess the cost recovery and to assess the investment multiples and so on and so forth. We have found it difficult.&amp;quot; The existing model of PSC has come in for criticism following a sharp dip in output from RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 gas fields. RIL has already recovered most of its investment from revenues earned from sale of natural gas even as output fell short of the targets.  The government is now trying to punish the firm by restricting its cost recovery by over USD 1 billion. DGH, the upstream nodal arm of the Oil Ministry, favoured moving to a system where companies would be asked to bid for the share of oil and/or gas they would offer to government. The highest bidder would get the right to explore and produce. This way the government will be guaranteed its minimum take at all levels of production and it would not have to bother with monitoring of cost and its recovery.  &amp;quot;There is a limit up to which you can improve the functionality of the existing PSC...because it is a signed contract so there is a limit. You cannot simply throw out everything,&amp;quot; Choubey said. &amp;quot;There is a limit up to which its functionality can be improved.&amp;quot; The government in May appointed a committee headed by C Rangarajan, Chairman of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, to review terms of the contracts signed by companies to explore and produce oil and gas and recommend necessary modifications for the future PSCs.  The Rangarajan Committee, to which DGH is also a member, would submit its report by the month end, Choubey said. The panel has been asked to suggest &amp;quot;structure and elements of the guidelines for determining the basis or formula for the price of domestically produced gas, and for monitoring actual price fixation.&amp;quot; "

KG D6 prod. at 28.5mmscmd, continued the declining trend Going ahead we remain cautious on refining and petchem cycle on the back of weak demand and/or new capacity additions. Sequentially, GRMs for RIL improved to &amp;amp;#36;9.5/bbl v/s &amp;amp;#36;7.6/bbl, mainly on the back of refinery outages, particularly in Japan, China and Tiwan leading to tighter market and hence stronger cracks. And the same has been reflected in bench mark Singapore GRMs at US&amp;amp;#36;9.1 for Sep12Qtr up from US&amp;amp;#36;7.1/bbl in JuneQtr12. Spread between light-heavy crude oil decreased QoQ. During Sep12Qtr Arab Light Arab Heavy crude oil differential was at US&amp;amp;#36;0.8bbl (US&amp;amp;#36;2.5bbl in June12Qtr) and Dubai-Arab Heavy differential at US&amp;amp;#36;0.6/bbl (US&amp;amp;#36;1.4/bbl in June12Qtr). Refinery throughput for Sep12Qtr stood at 17.6mntons as against 17.3mntons in June13Qtr. Exploration and ProductionRIL has lined up various initiatives for KG D6 for increasing upstream production in future. Company has submitted revised FDP for D1/D3, however the revised FDP for MA field (D 26) was recently approved. Going ahead RIL would file an integrated development plan taking into account an integrated view of D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 fields, the MA field and discoveries in satellite/R Series. It is expected to file the integrated FDP in H2 FY13. Incrementally it would be the integrated plan which would give an idea of what to expect in terms of gas reserve and production level. However actual production would take around 2years. Outlook and ValuationWhile the concerns on declining gas production in KG basin have remained, RIL stock has moved up by 15% and out performed broader market by 5% in the last 3 months. We maintain our outlook of weak refining cycle going ahead on the back of higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. Recently GRMs have gained support from refining mothballing in US and Europe and outages, particularly in Japan, China and Taiwan leading to tighter market and hence stronger cracks. However we suspect the sustainability of such support. Structurally, refining cycle is expected to remain weak with incremental net refining capacity additions expected to the tune of 1mbpd/1.3mbpd in 2012 / 2013, as against demand growth of 0.8mbpd / 1mbpd. In case of petchem, demand remains a concern and any weakness in demand could impact any sustained recovery in margins. With the likelihood of gas production declining further, the stock is likely to remain weak and under-perform going ahead. On the E&amp;amp;amp;P although RIL has lined up several initiatives across various fields/blocks, they are contingent upon government approvals. We would closely watch the government stance towards RIL&rsquo;s initiatives and any speeding up of approvals would be a positive move. However in the short to medium term, RIL&rsquo;s gas production from KG basin is expected to decline. We factor in average gas production of 30/25mmscmd for FY13/14. We remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of new capacities and/or weakening demand. The stock currently trades at FY14E PE multiple of 12.5x and 1.6x P/Bv.

RIL has repeatedly told the oil ministry that the contract which it signed with the state did not have any scope for auditing the performance of the field by the CAG.

RIL said CAG's 2009 audit, which it had agreed to as a one-time exception, turned out to be a 'performance' audit which was contrary to the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The PSC provides for checking of the contractor's accounts in order to verify the charges and credits but not questioning efficacies of processes or technology used in the complex deepsea operations. The CAG had in its first round of audit questioned the 'reasonableness' of costs incurred in the gas field development and said the government should revisit the profit sharing mechanism. CAG, in the second round, is to audit spending made by RIL during 2008-09 and 2011-12. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Also, due to seasonality of refining trends, brokerages are little cautious on the near-medium term outlook on the company. However, pace of capacity additions and price/demand environment will be deciding factors going ahead. Have a look on how brokerages view RIL stock post Q2 earnings. Antique Broking has assigned a 'hold' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 820. The firm states that RIL's upstream plans are subject to government approval and gas pricing regime and could be an overhang on the stock. The brokerage also sees limited upside in gross refining margins, a major revenue churner for the company. &amp;quot;We estimate GRMS to average at USD 8.5 /bbl for FY13,&amp;quot; it adds.  HSBC has cut RIL to 'underweight' with a target price of Rs 800 from 'neutral' on grounds that the energy conglomerate is unlikely to sustain a sudden jump in refining margins to USD9.5/bbl. The firm further says that RIL could meet market expectation only due to a rebound in refining margins and treasury gains from its huge cash pile which bolstered profits. Citi Research has given a 'neutral' rating to the stock with a target price of Rs 847. The firm further says volume growth in near term is likely to remain subdued as the company's new projects are three years away. There is also no clarity on exploration and production segment due to pending government approvals and non-clarity on pricing. &amp;quot;Earnings upside will, therefore, need to be margin-led which appears unlikely in all of RIL's business verticals,&amp;quot; it states. Angel Broking expects to the stock to remain muted in near term. &amp;quot;Guidance on KG-D6 production and increase in gas price would be key catalysts, going ahead,&amp;quot; it states."

It wants to feed India's burgeoning energy demand.  &amp;quot;We are evaluating various options... we are assessing where is the best gas we can bring from,&amp;quot; Haywood said on the sidelines of Petrotech 2012 conference here. &amp;quot;We are committed to sustainable gas supply to India.&amp;quot; BP is currently developing a huge LNG project in Indonesia named Tangguh, where it aims to produce around 7.6 trillion feet of LNG sourced from six offshore fields. India Gas Solutions Pvt Ltd, BP's equal joint venture with RIL, has already been incorporated and will focus on gas sourcing and marketing, development of infrastructure for transportation and marketing of gas within the country. Haywood did not say if BP-RIL combine may look at putting up a LNG import facility or would prefer to lease capacity in one or more the existing terminals for its imports. Last month, BP India head Sashi Mukundan had stated that the joint venture &amp;amp;nbsp;would finalise investment plans for downstream gas sector in 2013.  Among the options before BP-RIL are setting up a fixed inland LNG import facility or a floating terminal off the east or west coast, or buying stake in existing and upcoming LNG terminals. Haywood said BP was already in discussions for supply of gas to Indian consumers, but did not elaborate. Asked about natural gas pricing in India, he said domestic rates should be such that it can stimulate investments. Most of the domestically produced natural gas, including that of RIL-BP's eastern offshore KG-D6 fields, is priced at USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit, a rate which many in the industry now consider sub-market.  BP and RIL have been seeking revision in KG-D6 price, which the government had in 2007 fixed for first five years of production. KG-D6 field began production in April 2009."

Downstream (oil refining and marketing) are very much part of this plan,&amp;quot; RIL CEO (Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing) Tony Fountain told reporters at the Petrotech 2012 conference. Reliance Q2: Here's what the street is expecting RIL operates 33 million tonne domestic-tariff area or DTA refinery that sells most of its products to domestic market, and 29 million tonne only-for-exports or SEZ unit. &amp;quot;We are very much looking at all sorts of plans (for expanding refining capacity),&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We are looking at (expansion) options at both DTA and SEZ refineries.&amp;quot; Ambani had on June 7 announced investments of USD 12 billion in the company's core petrochemical and oil and gas businesses as well as in the new sectors of retail and telecom, to double operating profits in 4-5 years. Refinery expansion was not part of the plans Ambani had outlined to company shareholders on June 7. Fountain said RIL was also &amp;quot;looking at (refinery) configuration&amp;quot; to produce more value added products.  He however refused to provide details of investment or the expansion the company was looking at. RIL is setting up a USD 4 billion petroleum coke gasification project that will produce synthetic gas that will replace expensive LNG as fuel at the refinery. &amp;quot;We are adding significant project of petroleum coke gasification,&amp;quot; he said. India's oil refining capacity will rise 24 per cent to about 267 million tonnes by 2015-16. These plans do not include RIL expansion. He said the company continues to keep most of its 1,452 petrol pumps closed in the absence of a level playing field with its main public sector competition. While the government has freed petrol pricing, diesel continues to be sold at a heavily subsidised rates. &amp;quot;We are not selling diesel anywhere... Only a few outlets are operating (for petrol sales),&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We were 13 per cent of the market (before outlets were shutdown as it could notcomplete with public sector).&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We are ready to reopen (petrol pumps) if the fiscal environment is right,&amp;quot; he said, adding that the government should either free diesel pricing from its control or provide subsidy equivalent to private firms as well. India has 25 oil refineries with a crude oil processing capacity of 215.066 million tonne. This will rise to 264.966 million tonne by 2015-16 as fuel demand grows. Diesel consumption grew by 7.8 per cent in 2011-12 and by 10.2 per cent in the first quarter of current fiscal. This does not take into account the possible expansion by RIL. Indian Oil Corp, the nation's largest oil firm, plans to raise its refining capacity by 36.5 per cent to 74 million tonne. It will raise Koyali refinery capacity to 18 million tonne, from current 13.70 million tonne besides building a new 15 million tonne unit at Paradip in Orissa. Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) plans to raise its Mumbai refinery capacity from 6.5 million tonne to 8.20 million tonne and de-bottleneck its Visakhapatnam unit to increase capacity to 9 million tonne, from 8.3 million tonne. Similarly, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) is planning to de-bottleneck its Mumbai refinery to raise its capacity from 12 million tonne to 13.5 million tonne and hike Kochi unit capacity to 15.5 million tonne, from 9.5 million tonne. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemical Ltd (MRPL) will raise capacity to 16.5 million tonne, from 15 million tonne.  In private sector, Essar Oil will hike capacity of its Vadinar refinery in Gujarat to 30.80 million tonne, from 18 million tonnes by 2015-16. Nagarjuna Oil Corp Ltd's 6.10 million tonne refinery at Cuddalore is likely to be commissioned by 2015-16. "

Net sales are seen going up by 20.3 percent YoY to Rs 94,500 crore up by 2.9 percent QoQ.  What will drive earnings for RIL?RIL's gross refining margin (GRM)--the difference between the cost of processing crude and the revenue from selling finished petroleum products--is expected to rise anything between USD 9-9.5/bbl versus USD 7.6/bbl,QoQ and USD 10.1/bbl,YoY. Rise in GRMS will help offset comparatively weaker margins from RIL's petchem and exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) business. Not only higher GRMs, even the depreciating Rupee and higher other income will boost results says brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher which further expect the company's petrochemical segment to see some inventory destocking during the quarter. The firm also points out the gas output from RIL's KG-D6 basin will decline to 28 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd), from 37.8 mmscmd, YoY. Antique broking re-iterates that the company's earnings will rise on better GRMs which will strengthen at least by 36%,QoQ to over USD 9/bbl. The firm expects RIL's PAT to grow 17% to Rs 5200 crore, QoQ due to uptick in refining margins.  ICICI Securities says segment profit from RIL's petrochemicals business is expected to remain flat, QoQ. Falling gas output KG-D6 field will impact revenue and profitability of the company's E&amp;amp;amp;P business.  Religare points out that petrochemical margins will remain muted during the quarter on lacklustre demand, primarily from China, with an inventory build-up at the producers' &amp;amp;nbsp;end.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;An increase in naphtha prices and cheaper exports from the US made matters worse for naphtha crackers in Europe and Asia,&amp;quot; notes the firm. Motilal Oswal also expects RIL to deliver strong Q2 earnings led by higher GRMs. However, it also points out refining margins have again started to weaken. Also core businesses of RIL( Petchem and E&amp;amp;amp;P) remain volatile. KR Choksey has also predicted RIL to give a muted performance during the quarter. The firm states that the overall improvement in refining environment particularly expansion in middle distillates would likely enable RIL to clock in better refining margins at around &amp;amp;#36;9.8/bbl when compared with &amp;amp;#36;7.6/bbl QoQ.

The panel takes up clearances of blocks that have been pending for a long time. The government had in nine rounds of New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP), since 1999, awarded 254 blocks to domestic and overseas explorers. Of these, 52 blocks are stuck for want of clearances, hurting the nation's plan to expedite exploration of oil and gas to cut its ballooning import bill. &amp;quot;We have been clearing blocks and I believe only 11-12 blocks are pending for clearances now,&amp;quot; Chaturvedi said. Till August, 52 blocks awarded under various rounds of NELP bidding were pending for clearance by different organisations such as Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Environment and Forest, international boundary disputes and state governments. Of the blocks awaiting clearances, 22 were of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and 15 belong to Reliance Industries. Australian BHP Billiton's five blocks, three of Cairn India, two of Santos International and one each of British Gas, BP, Focus Energy, ENI of Italy and Jubilant Oil and Gas were stuck. Chaturvedi said out of 52 blocks, clearances were pending in respect of 43 blocks from Ministry of Defence due to deference related issues. Most of these have now been cleared. &amp;quot;Efforts have been made to get necessary clearances through meetings with concerned ministries/departments. Efforts are on to get clearances in respect of remaining blocks,&amp;quot; he said. Explorers led by RIL have so far invested about &amp;amp;#36;20.19 billion in oil and gas hunt in blocks awarded under NELP. So far, 113 oil and gas discoveries under NELP have been made in 38 blocks. Under NELP, about 737 million tonnes of oil equivalent hydrocarbons reserves have been added. India's crude oil import bill jumped 48% to Rs 672,220 crore in 2011-12. The nation imported 171.7 million tonnes of crude oil in 2011-12, up from 163.6 million tonnes imported in the previous year for Rs 455,276 crore.

The company has filed revised field development plans for the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields as well as D-26 MA oil and gas field - the only producing areas among a total of 19 oil and gas discoveries made in KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Sources said the company has scaled down capex in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields to USD 5.928 billion from USD 8.836 billion two-phase spending it had proposed in 2006. RIL has already spent USD 5.693 billion on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, that began producing gas in April 2009, and plans to invest a further USD 235 million in raising gas compression capacity. Sources said in the revised field development plan (FDP) for MA field, RIL has scaled down the investment by USD 276 million to USD 1.96 billion. RIL had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion in developing the MA discovery which began producing oil in September 2008 and gas in April 2009. A government-controlled panel, called the Management Committee, for approved the MA field's revised plans, wherein the operator (RIL) will drill one gas well and convert two oil wells into gas wells to raise output over the next 2-3 years. RIL has so far drilled six wells on the MA oilfield. But it had to shut two out of them due to high water and sand ingress, leading to drop in output from over 8 million cubic metres per day three years ago to just over 5 mmcmd currently. Sources said RIL in the revised FDP for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has stated that the remaining reserves in the fields do not justify drilling of any more wells and the additional USD 235 million spending would be for raising gas compression capacity. In the 2006, it had proposed to drill a total of 31 wells capable of producing 80 mmcmd of gas by 2012. However, RIL has so far drilled only 22 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3. Out of these only 18 have so far been put on production while the last four drilled in 2011 have not been connected to production system as they contain uneconomical reserves. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 are producing over 21 mmcmd of gas, down from 53-54 mmcmd achieved in March 2010. The output fell as high water and sand ingress shut six out of the 18 wells. RIL believes that the field has not behaved as predicted and so indiscriminate drilling would be a big drain on cost, they said adding the investment downgrade follows only 3.10 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas reserves remaining in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 instead of 10.03 Tcf estimated in the 2006 plan. RIL believes gas reserves lie in the satellite finds around D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and wants to develop them quickly to produce up to 30 mmcmd of additional gas."

A: I would recommend Banking stocks such as ICICI, Axis Bank and SBI for the long term.&amp;amp;nbsp; I would also recommend infra stocks such as IL&amp;amp;amp;FS Transport and Techno Electric.&amp;amp;nbsp; Bajaj Electric, Nesco and Ashiana Housing are good stocks for long term investors. Vijay Bhanushali: What is your call on Reliance Industries? A: In the short term I see it in the 780 to 880 range.&amp;amp;nbsp; In the long-term I think it will head to 960 as refining margins improve over time. Neeraj Bafna: What is your view on Shree Renuka Sugars? A: Renuka can be bought by investors who can hold it for at least a year with a target of Rs 57 and a stop loss of Rs 32.3.&amp;amp;nbsp;I think the sugar cycle should turn in Renuka's favor while its Brazilian operations seem to be bottoming out.&amp;amp;nbsp;Renuka's high debt levels remains a concern and I would advise investors to buy EID Parry if they are keen on the sugar sector. Gaurav Arora: What about Kingfisher Airlines? A: I would stay away from this company as I don't have any clarity on when the operations will restart and how many planes will be available for operations. I believe that it will be difficult for the airline to rope in a foreign investor on favorable terms. Parth Shroff: What is your call on Larsen and Toubro? A: I think Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro is a good stock for long term investors who are already holding the stock.&amp;amp;nbsp; For traders or new investors I would advise to wait for a dip below Rs 1500 to enter the stock.&amp;amp;nbsp; Short term traders can look to sell L&amp;amp;amp;T above 1680 with a stop loss of Rs 1720.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Priscilla Grihapathy: Is IndusInd Bank a 'buy' at current levels? A: No I think the stock will be a good buy below Rs 345 Parasram Kolekar: What about Tata Motors? A: I think Tata Motors will trade in a range of Rs 243 to 305.&amp;amp;nbsp; I would look to buy closer to the low end and sell above 300. Sumant Murarka: What is your call on DLF? A: I would stay away from the stock due to corporate governance issues.&amp;amp;nbsp; I think it will trade between 205 - 260 in the medium term.&amp;amp;nbsp; Nesco and Sobha Developers are better picks from the real estate sector. Shibu Kola: How will Gujarat State Petronet (GSPL) trade in October? A: I can't provide such a short term outlook.&amp;amp;nbsp; The broad trend in the stock is positive. Investors can buy below Rs 77 and hold for a target of Rs 95.&amp;amp;nbsp; The stop loss will be below Rs 71. Zameer Da: What is your view on Lanco Infra? A: I would prefer other power stocks such as NHPC or Tata Power over Lanco Infra.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  Aatish Sanghvi: What should I do with Praj Industries? A: I would sell it off or wait for a rally towards Rs 58 and then sell the stock.&amp;amp;nbsp; You would be better off my investing the money in other infra or power names as mentioned above. Joel Peter Lobo: What about Canara Bank and NTPC? A: Canara Bank is looking good along with the entire banking sector.&amp;amp;nbsp; It has a target of Rs 470. NTPC will remain in a narrow range of Rs 158 to Rs 180 until coal supply issues are sorted out so that it can aggressively expand its generation capacity. Mohit Goyal: What is your call on Mahindra Satyam? A: I think traders can book profits in Mahindra Satyam while long term investors can sell half their shares at current levels.&amp;amp;nbsp; They should get a chance to buy the stock below Rs 100. Karan C Parnami: What is your one-month target for Punjab National Bank? A: PNB should trade in the Rs 770 - 860 range in the next month. Rajesh Anand: What about ICSA? A:&amp;amp;nbsp; I don't have any view on the stock.&amp;amp;nbsp; The corporate governance and business position are questionable.&amp;amp;nbsp; I would recommend investors to stick to other infra or power stocks I mentioned above.

According to the research firm, recent diesel price hike and limiting subsidized LPG cylinders will reduce under-recoveries. However, FY13 estimated under-recoveries remain high at INR1.6t (+14% YoY) v/s INR1.4t in FY12. GRM up 36% QoQ, but YTD, both oil and GRM down 5% : Brent average crude price for 2QFY13 was marginally up 1% QoQ to USD110/bbl. However, volatility was high, led by Eurozone uncertainty, geopolitical developments, and QE3. Brent, after hitting a low of USD89/bbl in June-12, again rose to high of USD116/bbl in mid-Aug, before settling at current levels of USD111/bbl. Similar to oil, product cracks also were volatile with regional benchmark, Reuters Singapore GRM averaging USD9.1/bbl v/s USD6.7/bbl in 1QFY13. Unless meaningful refinery closures happen, we expect margins to remain subdued as global utilization is likely to remain low led by lower demand and commissioning of new refineries. Petchem spreads subdued: In 2QFY13, polymer spreads over naphtha are down 7-8% QoQ, while integrated polyester spreads are down 2-4% QoQ. However, YoY, PE spreads are up 24% and PP spreads 7%. Polymer margins seem to have bottomed out and are expected to slowly recover, contingent on the global economic growth. Lower LPG losses help QoQ drop in under-recoveries: We estimate 2QFY13 underrecoveries at INR390b, down 18% QoQ, primarily helped by lower LPG losses due to lower international prices. As the recent government decision to increase diesel price by INR5/ltr and limit subsidized LPG cylinder was effected on 13 September 2012, the meaningful positive impact of the same will be seen in subsequent quarters. Subsidy sharing would be again ad hoc as in the previous years, and it will be finalized in the last quarter. We model upstream sharing at 40% and downstream sharing at nil/8% for FY13/FY14, with the balance being the government's share. Valuation and view: Recent diesel price hike and limiting subsidized LPG cylinders will reduce under-recoveries.

But the same is likely to grow by 20 percent quarter-on-quarter. Net sales are seen going up by 2.9 percent QoQ and 20.3 percent YoY to Rs 94,500 crore in the July-September quarter of 2012. Gross refining margin is expected to be at USD 9-9.5 a barrel in the quarter gone by as against USD 7.6 a barrel in the previous quarter and USD 10.1 a barrel in a year ago period. Investors should watch out for following factors: Brent crude prices averaged at USD 110 a barrel, a rise of 1% over previous quarter. Brent crude hit a low of USD 89 a barrel in June and then rose to USD 116 a barrel in mid-August but settled near USD 111 a barrel. So some inventory gains are also expected. SCRMs (Singapore Complex Refining Margins) averaged at USD 9.13 a barrel in the September quarter as against USD 6.65 a barrel in previous quarter. The improvement in GRMs on quarter-on-quarter basis is led by improvement in diesel, kerosene, petrol and naphtha spreads. Petrochemicals spreads were almost stable QoQ. The gas production from its KG-D6 basin is expected to average at around 28 mcmd as against 32 mcmd QoQ, say experts. Higher other income due to high cash levels and weak rupee is going to support the bottomline of July-September quarter."

An equal status for power plants can be considered as we give to fertiliser,&amp;quot; he said. With KG-D6 output dipping to 27.5 million standard cubic meters per day instead of rising to projected 80 mmscmd, a pro-rata cut in supplies has been effected on 25 power plants which had originally been allocated 28.90 mmscmd of gas.

LPG manufacturing plants got 2.6 mmscmd of gas while the remaining 9.3 mmscmd was prorated among 25 power plants.

Meanwhile, Power Ministry has also asked the companies not to set up any new gas-based projects till 2015, due to scarce availability of the fuel.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; To overcome the situation, some private power producers have demanded that price of domestic natural gas be pooled or averaged out with high cost imported LNG so that a levelised and affordable price of gas is available.

Natural gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields and MA oil field in the Bay of Bengal KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block has slid to about 26 million standard cubic meters per day from 61.5 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. &amp;quot;It (production) will keep coming down,&amp;quot; Chaturvedi said. &amp;quot;We are convinced that in a do-nothing scenario, production will keep coming down.&amp;quot; RIL executive director PMS Prasad and BP India head Sashi Mukundan had in July met oil minister S Jaipal Reddy for nearly three and half hours to highlight the exigency facing the flagging KG-D6 fields due to his ministry not approving annual budgets and capital spending for three years.RIL-BP at the meeting had said output at KG-D6 will continue to fall in absence of interventions needed to revive some of the seven wells that had been shut due to water and sand ingress. Chaturvedi said through the annual investments were agreed upon in an Oil Ministry-controlled block oversight committee in August, the resolutions reflecting them haven't been signed due to certain issues. The oil ministry wants RIL to give Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) access to its books for conducting audit as a precondition for allowing future capitalexpenditure in the block.  RIL says it is ready for any financial audit by CAG but will not agree on a performance audit, wherein technical decisions like selection of a particular technology or vendor for the complex deepsea operations may come in for questioning by a non-technical authority. It says CAG is not authorised to do a performance audit either under the Act it was formed or under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).  &amp;quot;We have told (RIL) that the audit will be under Section 1.9 of the PSC,&amp;quot; Chaturvedi said. Section 1.9 provides for audit of charges and credits by a government auditor. BP in a statement on July 18 stated that it had attendeda joint meeting convened by the ministry on July 13 but refuted reports of a potential KG-D6 production shut-in. RIL holds geological uncertainties as well as high water and sand ingress in wells for the fall in production and hadat the beginning of the current fiscal projected an output of 27.6 mmscmd for 2012-13. This, as per its own projections, was to further dip to 22.6 mmscmd in 2013-14 and then to 20.4 mmscmd. "

RIL in August submitted a revised field development plan (FDP) for the Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3), the only producing gas fields among a total of 18 gas discoveries made so far in the KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal, sources with direct knowledge of the development said. The company, which had in 2006 proposed an investment of USD 8.836 billion in two-phases on the fields, in the revised FDP has outlined a further investment of only USD 235 million over and above USD 5.693 billion that has already been spent. Sources said RIL in the revised FDP submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has stated that the remaining reserves in the fields do not justify drilling of any more wells and the additional USD 235 million spending would be for raising gas compression capacity. Also Read: Reliance Industries tanks on Morgan Stanley downgrade In the 2006, it had proposed to drill a total of 31 wells capable of producing 80 million standard cubic metres per day(mmscmd) of gas by 2012. However, the company has so far drilling only 22 wells on the fields. Out of these only 18 have so far been put on production while the last four drilled in 2011 have not been connected to production system as they contain uneconomical reserves. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 are producing less than 22 mmscmd of gas, down from 53-54 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. The output fell as the company shut six out of the 18 wells due to high water and sand ingress. RIL, which according to the 2006 approved FDP was to drill the 31 wells by end of March 2011, believes that the field has not behaved as predicted and so indiscriminate drilling would be a big drain on cost. The Oil Ministry had, however, seen non-drilling of the committed wells as a violation under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and slapped a notice disallowing over USD one billion in cost as a penalty. Together with about 5.5 mmscmd of output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 output is around 27.5 mmscmd currently. Sources said investment downgrade follows only 3.10 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas reserves remaining in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 instead of 10.03 Tcf estimated in the 2006 plan. RIL, which is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, believes gas reserves lie in the satellite finds around D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and wants to develop them quickly to produce up to 30 mmscmd of additional gas. RIL, DGH and the oil ministry have been under attack for raising capex estimates for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields from USD 2.4 billion proposed in the initial FDP in 2004 to USD 8.836 billion in the final and approved FDP of 2006. This higher investment was justified by projections of output doubling to 80 mmscmd from 40 mmscmd proposed in the initial plan as well as global surge in the devolvement cost of the deepwater block. RIL had previously secured approval of a government-controlled panel, called Management Committee, for revised FDP for MA oilfield in the KG-D6 block. As part of the revised plan for MA field, RIL will drill one gas well and convert two six oil wells into gas wells on the MA oilfield to raise production over the next two to three years. RIL has so far drilled six wells on the MA oilfield, the only oil discovery among the 19 oil and gas finds the company had made in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Besides producing oil, the field also produces natural gas. But the closure of two out of the six wells due to high water and sand ingress has led to drop in output from over 8 mmscmd three years ago to about 5.5 mmscmd this month. To address the problem, RIL and its partners - BP plc of UK and Niko Resources of Canada, submitted a Revised FDP for MA oilfield in February this year. Sources said in the revised FDP, RIL has scaled down the investment required for developing the MA oilfield by USD 276 million to USD 1.96 billion. RIL had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion in developing the Dhirubhai-26 or MA discovery. Besides gas, the field has also lagged behind targets in oil production. The field, which started production in September 2008, is producing less than half of the estimated peak output of 20,000 barrels of oil per day due to water and sand ingress in wells. Sources said that in the revised plan, capital expenditure at MA field has been estimated at USD 1.96 billion as against a capex of USD 2.234 billion approved in 2006. It is based on reduction in volumes -- oil goes down from 159 million barrels to 122 million barrel and gas from 941 billion cubic feet to 924 bcf. The lower capex includes allocation of USD 111 million for drilling of seventh well on the field and work-overs or maintenance of two existing ones, including the ones currently shut, at the cost of USD 164 million."

The ministry had ordered that a part of 2.594 million standard cubic meters per day of KG-D6 gas allocated to state-owned GAIL India Ltd's be diverted to Hyderabad-based Bhagaynagar Gas Ltd (BGL) under a so-called gas swapping guidelines. GAIL was to make good the shortfall through imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) which costs four-times the KG-D6 gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit. GAIL was to charge BGL the actual price of imported LNG. RIL in a letter to the ministry said if such an &amp;quot;untenable&amp;quot; policy was allowed it would encourage KG-D6 allottees to sell the cheap gas at higher rates during times like plant shutdowns when they don't need the fuel. &amp;quot;KG-D6 gas has been allocated by Government under gas use policy approved by EGoM specifying, sector priority, plant location and use, whereas to implement the said guidelines, RIL is expected to accept change in sector, location and use from currently allocated end use of KG-D6 gas, and not at the instance of the Government but at the behest of the customer apparently without any reference to or intervention of the government,&amp;quot; RIL wrote. The ministry had on September 21 written to RIL saying a gas swap &amp;quot;parties do not have to approach government for approval.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The swapping guidelines are untenable and cannot be reconciled with existing Gas Use Policy,&amp;quot; RIL wrote. Based on EGoM decisions, customer wise allocations with specific end use and that too at a specified location was made. RIL's Gas Sales and Purchase Agreements (GSPAs) with users reflect the end use of gas and location of the plant. &amp;quot;If implemented, these (swapping) guidelines would render any meaningful monitoring of the end use impossible either by the government or by RIL and result in... Trading of gas allocated,&amp;quot; RIL wrote. As an example, RIL said for a customer used both LNG and KG-D6 gas, the price differential between domestic gas and LNG was so huge that it need not use the gas but simply give it to another user who uses imported LNG. &amp;quot;Even those allottes who are required to run continuous operating units would divert KG-D6 gas during their low/nil requirement period such as shutdown or maintenance,&amp;quot; RIL said. &amp;quot;If that is the result of the swapping guidelines, in our submission there is no justification whatsoever in continuing to deny contractors (like RIL) the marketing freedom in the domestic market specifically stipulated in New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and the Production Sharing Contract (PSC),&amp;quot; the company said. RIL said the swapping guidelines in effect meant &amp;quot;granting marketing rights, with complete freedom, to the customers and allottees of KG-D6 gas.&amp;quot; The firm added that it was necessary for RIL to uphold the use restriction for D6 customer as the proposed guidelines can lead to KG-D6 allottees &amp;quot;trading&amp;quot; in their allocation."

Also, the firm signed a new agreement to buy more Venezuelan oil for its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat. &amp;quot;PDVSA will supply between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan heavy crude oil to RIL's two refineries in Jamnagar under a 15-year crude oil supply contract,&amp;quot; the statement said. RIL operates twin refineries at Jamnagar with a total refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. Half of its crude diet can be heavy oil.  RIL had in 2008 signed an agreement to buy 150,000 bpd of oil, which was gradually raised to 270,000 bpd at present. Under the new 15-year agreement, the South American country would sell between 300,000 bpd and 400,000 bpd beginning next year. Venezuela is important for RIL as it buys crude oil from the South American nation for its refineries in Jamnagar. The complex refineries of RIL are suitable to process relatively-cheaper Venezuelan crude where margins are high. PDVSA said earlier this month that it plans to raise overall shipments to India to 518,000 barrels a day by 2018. RIL may take up Venezuela's Boyaca 4 block and a separate section in the Ayacucho area of the Orinoco belt for development. Both these areas can produce 200,000 barrels per day (10 million tons a year) each.  &amp;quot;As per the MoU, RIL will explore upstream options for joint participation in heavy oil projects of the Orinoco Oil Belt,&amp;quot; the statement said. RIL would also cooperate with PdVSA by providing technical assistance and sharing its experience of executing large scale projects in areas of offshore upstream, refining and other downstream projects.  &amp;quot;The signing of the contract and MoU marks furtherstrengthening of the long-standing relationship between RIL&amp;amp;nbsp; and PdVSA. RIL and PdVSA also plan to work together on studies of how to update and improve Venezuela's refinery network, as well as PdVSA's plans to tap offshore natural gas reserves, including the long-delayed Mariscal Sucre project, which is due to begin extraction before the end of this year.  RIL was in 2009 supposed to bid with the Indian consortium of ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian Oil Corp and Oil India Ltd for one of the three giant oil blocks Venezuela was offering the auction. It, however, walked out of theconsortium possibly because of delays in bidding. After RIL's exit, OVL-IOC-OIL teamed up with Repsol YPF SA, Spain's biggest oil company, and Malaysia's Petronas to made a successful bid for the massive Carabobo-1 project in Venezuela's Orinoco heavy oil belt. The field, which had about 50 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, can produce a minimum of 400,000 bpd of oil."

If the formula is approved, it would result in a gas price of slightly under &amp;amp;#36;13 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at an oil price of &amp;amp;#36;100 per barrel, it said. &amp;quot;The proposed formula was based on the pricing formula under a contract for long-term import of LNG into India and was universally accepted by arm's length buyers who bid in large numbers in an open price discovery process,&amp;quot; Niko, which holds 10 per cent interest in KG-D6 block, said in its operational review. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent stake while the remaining 30 per cent is held by UK's Bp plc. RIL on September 6 wrote a reminder to A Giridhar, Joint Secretary (Exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas seeking approval of the price. The company wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus &amp;amp;#36;0.26 per mmBtu. At &amp;amp;#36;100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost &amp;amp;#36;12.93 per mmBtu. The formula proposed by RIL is the same at which Petronet LNG LtdBSE 0.22 %, the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer, buys 7.5 million tonnes per annum (30 million standard cubic meters per day) of LNG from RasGas of Qatar. RasGas charges 12.67 per cent of JCC and Petronet, which is headed by Oil Secretary, pays a further &amp;amp;#36;0.26 per mmBtu for shipping the gas in its liquid form (LNG) from Qatar. &amp;quot;We believe gas market demand fundamentals are strong in India, where gas markets have historically been supply constrained,&amp;quot; Niko said. Despite increases in LNG imports and domestic production, the gap between supply and demand in India has remained high and it could grow in the future. &amp;quot;The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the D6 Block states that natural gas must be sold at arm's length prices, with 'arm's length' defined as sales made freely in the open market between willing and unrelated sellers and buyers, and that the pricing formula be approved by the government taking into account the prevailing policy on natural gas,&amp;quot; it said. Niko said RIL in May 2007 discovered an arm's length price for the sale of gas on a transparent basis with a term of three years and accordingly, proposed a gas price formula to the Government. "

The oil-to-textile group headed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani is making a re-entry into the telecommunication business and is being talked as the most aggressive bidder in the November auction of telecom spectrum.  Sitting on a cash-pile of Rs 70,732 crore at the end of the June quarter, RIL was the most notable participant at the pre-bid conference organised by the Department of Telecom (DoT) in the run-up to the auction.  RIL is most likely to put a direct bid, a source privy to the development said. If for some reasons it is unable to make a bid by itself, the company may fund purchase of spectrum by another company and then acquire it. A company spokesperson declined to comment on speculation about the issue.  The company had in 2010 re-entered the telecom space after it acquired Infotel Broadband which had won pan-India spectrum for offering high-speed internet broadband. The pan-India spectrum that RIL holds through InfotelBroadband does not has permission to provide voice calling facility. Any spectrum that does not allow voice calls is not a big revenue earner and so RIL as the next logical step would want to acquire spectrum which it can bundle its high speed mobile broadband service, the source said. The government plans to begin auction of spectrum vacated from cancellation of 122 telecom licenses by the Supreme Court, from November 12. The source said representatives of RIL subsidiary Infotel Broadband have been attended meetings organised by Department of Telecommunications on proposed spectrum auction.  RIL entered in to telecom business by acquiring Infotel Broadband on the day the later won pan-India airwaves frequencies for Rs 12,847.71 crore in 2010. The company has already revealed its plan to use LTE technology for its country wide network deployment but is yet to start its services. Government has plans to auction airwaves frequencies in 1800 Mhz band and 800 Mhz band which are being currently used for GSM and CDMA mobile telephony services respectively. A new player bidding for 1800 will have to pay minimum of Rs 14,000 crore for pan-India services and for 800 Mhz band itis Rs 9,100 crore.  According to auction rules, for 1800 Mhz band, new entrants will be required to bid for minimum of 4 blocks each of 1.25MHz in each service area and for 800 Mhz band it is minimum of 2 blocks each of 1.25MHz in each service area. RIL has plans to provide digital services in key domains of national interest such as education, healthcare, security, financial services, government-citizen interfaces and entertainment. "

That can be done only through dialogues and discussions,&amp;quot; the ONGC chairman said. The CAG report said ONGC &amp;quot;deviated from the standard tendering procedure and hired a rig viz Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-1 (DDKG-1) from RIL without calling for competitive bids for a period of four years on untenable grounds&amp;quot;. In reply to a question, Vasudeva denied reports that the state-run company has bid USD 5 billion for the Canadian assets of ConcoPhillips along with Oil India and IndianOil, but said it is looking at international assets purchases."

India currently has 15 different rates ranging from USD 2.52 per million British thermal unit to USD 6.77 per mmBtu for natural gas produced from domestic fields. The highest rate is roughly half the rate at which the nation imports gas in ships in its liquid form (liquefied natural gas). &amp;quot;Natural gas prices must be determined by market forces,&amp;quot; the 12th Five Year (2012-17) Plan document states. Besides approving price, the government also fixes gas users and allocates quantities, creating hurdles to gas market development. Reliance Industries, which sells natural gas produced from its eastern offshore KG-D6 fields at USD 4.205 per mmBtu, is seeking rates equivalent to price India pays for importing LNG. The company wants to price KGD6 gas at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu from April 1, 2014 when the current approval for current rates expire. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. It also wants to price the gas it plans to produce from coal seams, called coal-bed methane (CBM), from its contract area in Madhya Pradesh according to the same formula, but the Oil Ministry has not approved it despite the company sending almost one-and-a-half dozen reminders. &amp;quot;There is need for clarity on fiscal incentives on exploration of natural gas under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP),&amp;quot; the Plan document said. RIL won the KG-D6 block and Sohagpur CBM area under separate NELP rounds. &amp;quot;Eliminate the uncertainty that has arisen regarding gas pricing for NELP production sharing contracts by implementing a new design of contracts based on the recommendation of the Rangarajan Committee,&amp;quot; the Plan document said listing reforms required in the oil and gas sector. &amp;quot;Appropriate steps should be taken to resolve conflicts in existing contracts where the interpretation of the contract term is open to multiple options,&amp;quot; it added. Besides, it called for incentivising exploration and production of domestic non-conventional fuels like shale gas and CBM. Also, it wanted natural gas/LNG to be given the 'Declared Goods Status' so that a uniform central sales tax can be levied on the environment friendly fuel rather than present practice of varying state VAT. This would lead to uniform price of gas in most of the states, it said."

RIL on September 6 wrote to A Giridhar, Joint Secretary (Exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas proposing to price natural gas it produces from the Krishna Godavari basin block in Bay of Bengal at a rate equivalent to price India pays for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG). The company wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67% of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu, sources with direct knowledge of the development said. The formula proposed by RIL is the same at which Petronet LNG Ltd, the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer, buys 7.5 million tonnes per annum (30 million standard cubic meters per day) of LNG from RasGas of Qatar. RasGas charges 12.67% of JCC and Petronet, which is headed by Oil Secretary, pays a further USD 0.26 per mmBtu for shipping the gas in its liquid form (LNG) from Qatar. RIL said it needs to &amp;quot;achieve financial closure in order to undertake further development activities in the block. Therefore, it is once again requested that approval of the Government to the price formula as proposed... be conveyed to us without further delay.&amp;quot; The company said the price formula it has proposed would apply for all gas produced from KG-D6 block post March 2014. Besides currently producing Dhirubhai-1 &amp;amp;amp; 3 gas fields and MA oil field, the formula would also apply to D2, D6, D19 and D22 fields -- the field development plan of which has been approved by the government, it said. The government had in 2007 fixed a price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu for gas from KG-D6 block for first five years of production. KG-D6 fields began production on April 1, 2009 and the current price expires on March 31, 2014. From April 1, 2014, RIL wants the gas to be price at import parity as is done in case of crude oil. Domestic oil producers like state-owned ONGC get import parity or a rate equivalent to international oil price, for the crude oil they produce from domestic fields. &amp;quot;The proposed formula is in full compliance of the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) that mandate that gas must be sold at arms-length prices to the benefit of the parites under the PSC,&amp;quot; RIL President and COO B Ganguly wrote to the Oil Ministry. &amp;quot;Imported LNG in the country constitutes about 35% of gas consumption in the country and this share is expected to progressively increase. Hence long term LNG prices represent the best benchmark for arms-length prices,&amp;quot; he added. "

At this price point, the cost of the proposed towers would as low as one-fortieth of the base stations deployed by some leading mobile phone service providers. These low-cost towers are part of the strategy of country's largest private sector enterprise as it gears up for its foray into telecom space through Infotel Broadband. Industry sources said some leading telecom companies are using telecom towers costing as high as Rs 30-40 lakh, while some of the low-cost towers cost Rs 15-20 lakh. Some Chinese firms, however, claim to have developed telecom towers worth Rs 5-10 lakh. Costs vary as per the volume of the order and transmission capabilities, among other factors, said experts. &amp;quot;Infotel is planning to build its network with a mix of rented mobile towers and its own BTSs (base tower station or mobile towers). The BTSs that Infotel is working on are expected to cost it Rs 1 lakh each,&amp;quot; a source said. A RIL spokesperson declined to comment on the issue. The rentals for telecom towers also varies between Rs 30,000-50,000 per month, making the proposed base stations of RIL group a very cost-effective model, sources said. Besides an estimated one lakh towers of its own, RIL group would also consider leasing out the base stations from third parties, sources aware of the developments said. Infotel is focussing on a low-cost model so that it can keep the rates of 4G telecom services lower than that of other players. The services may be launched as early as 2012-end, but there is more likelihood of launch in 2013. In earlier days, the cost of setting-up of stand-alone BTSs (mobile towers) was Rs 50-60 lakh. With advancement in technology, it has come down to Rs 30-40 lakh for a high quality tower. Infotel Broadband had earlier floated tender for its plans to deploy base stations at around one lakh locations, after which some tower companies offered to rent out their towers. This it would have to share with other telecom companies as well.  The rentals were offered in a wide range of Rs 15,000-50,000 per month, excluding various on-site costs. Infotel is also likely to manage on its own the network, IT infrastructure and other services, which are normally outsourced by telecom operators to keep operational costs low. At present, only Bhart Airtel and state-run telecom company BSNL provide 4G services in the country out of eight firms that hold BWA spectrum. "

Reliance Industries and Cairn India want to drill exploration wells in already producing oil and gas fields, but the ministry's technical arm DGH had previously opined that such activity in an area that is producing hydrocarbons is not permissible under Production-Sharing Contract (PSC). DGH felt the government's profit share, which is triggered when an explorer recovers all his cost, would be adversely impacted if new costs are added. To get around this, the ministry is now formulating a policy to allow cost recovery of an exploration well drilling in a producing field, only in circumstances where it leads to a commercially exploitable find, official sources said. This would be a significant departure from the signed contracts that allow companies to first recover all their costs before sharing profits with the government. Globally, explorers keep drilling exploration wells to replace the reserves that may have been produced. And the new change the government is proposing, is bound to be opposed by operators like RIL. While RIL has proposed to drill an exploration well on the flagging D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block to study reservoir characteristic, Cairn wants to drill new probes to help raise output from the Rajasthan block to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 175,000 bpd. The ministry is in agreement with the operators on the need to drill exploration wells within a producing oil or gas field so as to add more reserves and increase production life but it does not want to take a decision that CAG may tomorrow criticise as causing loss to the exchequer in lower profit petroleum, sources said. Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had sometime back taken a view that exploration is not permitted within an area that has been delineated after discoveries for production of hydrocarbons. As a way out, the ministry wants to frame a new policy for allowing exploration in a development area and will put it up to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for approval, they said. Globally, exploration is permitted in fields that are under production so as to keep adding new reserves to replenish ones that have been produced. In absence of rejuvenation, the fields will terminally decline from the day output starts. The same principal has been followed in fields in Assam and Mumbai offshore. _PAGEBREAK_ Under Production Sharing Contract (PSC), all petroleum operations, be it exploration, production or appraisal well, are cost recoverable - meaning the cost of such investment is first allowed to be deducted from revenues earned from sale of oil/gas and profits split with the government only after that. Cairn believes that production from its prolofic Rajasthan block can reach 300,000 bpd or 15 million tons per annum and has made an application to the government seeking permission to explore within the 3,111 square km mining lease covering 25 oil and gas finds. It has even given up its rights under PSC by proposing that it will not seek recovery of cost of the exploration well unless it is successful ie, results in a commercial discovery. Cost of a dry or no discovery well will be borne by the company. RIL however does not believe in surrendering its rights guaranteed under PSC - that is to recover all exploration and production cost from sale of oil or gas before sharing profits with the government. But to give government the comfort, it has as a one-time exception agreed to drill the exploration well 'MJ1' at its sole risk and recover cost only if the discoveries are assessed to be commercial. Sources said RIL believes that exploration well is clearly allowed in any mining lease area under law and the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) also supports it. Cairn also believes that the PSC defines a development area as one that not just includes a discovery or a group of discoveries but also &amp;quot;area of potential petroleum deposits&amp;quot;. These deposits can only be exploited if exploration is allowed within the mining lease. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields in the east offshore KG-D6 block of RIL have seen output fall from 53-54 million standard cubic metre per day achieved in March, 2010 to 21.93 mmscmd this month. Together with just over 5.53 mmscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 is producing about 27.5 mmscmd. This output is short of 80 mmscmd production level that was envisaged in the field development plan approved in 2006. Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal had on July 6 written to the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking his intervention so that his group firm Cairn India is allowed to explore oil in the prolific Rajasthan block. &amp;quot;The Rajasthan Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and the mining lease have enabling provisions that allow carrying on exploration in development area; however, we have been asked to obtain government approval,&amp;quot; Agarwal, whose group had last year acquired Cairn India, wrote to Prime Minister on July 6. The 3,111 sq km development area was ring-fenced from an exploration area more than three times its size after discoveries were made."

RIL has so far drilled six wells on the MA oilfield, the only oil discovery among the 19 oil and gas finds the company had made in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. Besides producing oil, the field also produces natural gas. But the closure of two out of the six wells due to high water and sand ingress has led to drop in output from over 8 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) three years ago to 5.53 mmscmd this month. To address the problem, RIL and its partner BP Plc of UK submitted a Revised Field Development Plan for MA oilfield in February this year, sources privy to the development said. The revised plan envisages drilling of a new gas well and conversion of two sick (or closed) oil wells to gas wells in order to maximise the gas production from the field, they said. Together with 21.93 mmscmd of output from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 or D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas field, the KG-D6 block currently a little less than 27.5 mmscmd of gas. Sources said in the revised field development plan, RIL has scaled down the investment required for developing the MA oilfield by USD 276 million to USD 1.96 billion. RIL had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion in developing the Dhirubhai-26 or MA discovery, the only oil find in KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin off the east coast. Besides gas, the field has also lagged behind targets in oil production. The field, which started production in September 2008, is producing less than half of the estimated peak output of 20,000 barrels of oil per day due to water and sand ingress in wells. Sources said in the Revised Field Development Plan, submitted to the government for approval, capital expenditure at MA field has been estimated at USD 1.96 billion as against a capex of USD 2.234 billion approved in 2006. The RFDP is based on reduction in volumes -- oil goes down from 159 million barrels to 122 million barrel and gas from 941 billion cubic feet (bcf) to 924 bcf. The lower capex includes allocation of USD 111 million for drilling of seventh well on the field and work-overs or maintenance of two existing ones, including the ones currently shut, at the cost of USD 164 million. Sources said RIL-BP would submit a revised development plan for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields, the main producing area in KG-D6, by October. RIL had in the original field development plan for D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. Of this, about 60 per cent has been spent so far."

CAG, in a report table in the Parliament today, said ONGC &amp;quot;deviated from the standard tendering procedure and hired a rig viz Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-1 (DDKG-1) from RIL without calling for competitive bids for a period of four years on untenable grounds&amp;quot;. ONGC had in May 2009 hired DDKG-1 from RIL for four years ending July 2013 without calling for competitive bids at an operating day rate of USD 495,000 for first 180 days and at USD 510,000 from 181st day onwards. The effective day rate worked out to USD 563,488. CAG said the company in December 2008 projected a requirement of rig capable of drilling in ultra deep water (water depth of 10,000 feet) by December 2010 to meet its work commitment in exploration block it had won under NELP rounds. &amp;quot;On the plea that no ultra deep water rig was available with it before December 2010, the company (ONGC) hired the rig from RIL,&amp;quot; it said in the report for 2010-11 fiscal. The rig, CAG pointed out, was in fact hired by RIL from Deepwater Pacific-1 Inc in October 2007 for a period of five years commencing July 2009 and ending July 2014. &amp;quot;Upon RIL's willingness (in March 2009) to share the rig with the company (ONGC), the latter obtain the same rig from RIL under a tripartite assignment agreement on the same rates, terms and conditions as were applicable to RIL,&amp;quot; it said. Stating that ONGC did not obtain competitive bids before hiring the rig from RIL, CAG said the state-owned firm had in July 2009 projected &amp;quot;a situation of emergency&amp;quot; to acquire an ultra deep water rig by deviating from the standard tendering procedure of competitive bidding. The company drilled seven ultra deep wells using DDKG-1 rig till December 2010. Of these seven well, three were appraisal wells, drilled to confirm previous finds. &amp;quot;In December 2009, the company (ONGC) itself had expressed its inability to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in committing a definite development plan for these (discovery) wells stating that demonstrable technology implementation analogues were not available in the world in such ultra deep waters. &amp;quot;Hence, in the absence of technology, drilling of these appraisal wells was not crucial to decide their commercial viability by December 2010,&amp;quot; the audit said. CAG said the remaining four wells could have been drilled after December 2010 when another rig - Platinum Explorer was scheduled to be mobilised by ONGC. &amp;quot;Moreover, the Government of India had already granted extension of time to the company to drill these well by March/May 2011 under the rig moratorium policy,&amp;quot; it added. Listing deviations from standard contractual terms, the official auditor said ONGC agreed to pay standby day rate or daily payments when rig was not operating at the rate of 98% of the operating day rate instead of standard terms and condition obliging it to pay at the rate of no more than 95%. &amp;quot;As a result, it had to make extra payment of USD 1,802,005 (Rs 8.11 crore) during July 2009 to October 2011,&amp;quot; it said."

OVL has invested in oil and gas fields in four countries high on US sanction list -- Iran, Myanmar, Syria and Sudan. Of these, its investments in Iran are the ones that is stalling closure of any shale gas deal.

OVL has since 2003 invested about USD 87.875 million in Farsi block in Iranian Persian Gulf and has discovered a giant Farzad-B gas field.

Of the blocks awaiting approvals, 22 belong to Oil and Natural Gas Corp, 15 to Reliance Industries, five to BHP Billiton, three to Cairn Energy India and two to Australia's Santos Ltd. British firms BG Group, BP and Italy's ENI own one each. Reddy said clearances for larger areas from which these blocks are carved out are obtained from concerned ministries before auctioning them.

The firms have invested USD 12.4 billion for exploration and development activities in the blocks, Reddy told lawmakers in a written reply. The world's fourth biggest oil importer, India wants to tap domestic supply to cut its ballooning import bill and widening fiscal deficit. Its crude oil import bill surged 48% to Rs 672000 crore&amp;amp;nbsp;in the year to March due to rising global oil prices, declining rupee and expanding refining capacity. The economy is growing at its slowest pace in nearly a decade and policy paralysis has stalled major reforms including those on fuel pricing, denting global investors' confidence in the Indian oil sector. In 2010, Brazil's Petrobras and Norway's Statoil exited from a block operated by ONGC in the hydrocarbon-rich Krishna Godavari Basin off India's east coast. India, which imports about 80% of its oil needs, has awarded 249 blocks under nine licensing rounds since 1999. Oil and gas discoveries have been made in 38 blocks."

RIL's Dubai-based subsidiary Reliance Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production DMCC last month signed agreements to sell 25 per cent interest in producing Block 9 in Yemen to Medco Energi, industry sources said. The stake sale follows billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run firm exiting from two oil blocks in Kurdistan region of Iraq on July 19. RIL had in 2001 won Yemen's Block 9 along with Hood Energy and Calvalley Petroleum Inc. RIL and Hood Energy held 25% stake each while Calvalley had the remaining 50%. Sources said RIL's sale agreement with Medco would be effective from January 1.&amp;amp;nbsp;While the agreement is for a 25% interest, Medco would effectively have a 21.25% participating interest in the block because, under a regulation in Yemen, the contractor of a production-sharing agreement has to accommodate a working interest for the country, which is represented by the Yemen Oil and Gas Company, which will hold a 15% stake. Accordingly, the operator Calvalley Petroleum would have 42.5% interest and Hood Oil 21.25% stake. Block 9 lies covers 2,234 square kilometres in the Sayun-Masila basin in Yemen's Hadramaut province, about 350-km north-east of the Yemeni capital, Sana. It is estimated to hold proven plus probable reserves of 58.6 million barrels of oil. RIL would get another USD 5 million if the block produces 10,000 barrels of oil per day. The block currently produces between 6,000 bpd and 6,500 bpd. A 20 year construction contract was granted over the block by the Yemeni government in 2005 which the joint venture can apply to have extended for a further five years after 2025. After the sale, RIL is left with interest in block 34 and 37 in eastern Yemen where is is investing USD 66 million with its patner Hood. RIL had last month sold its 80% interest in Rovi and Sarta onland blocks in northern Iraq to US oil behemoth Chevron Corp for a reported USD 200 million. The exits are part of the company's overseas asset restructuring wherein it is cutting exposure in exploration blocks to focus on producing properties. After the exit from Kurdistan and Yemen, RIL now is left with a portfolio of 10 overseas oil and gas assets including two each in Peru, Yemen, Oman and Colombia and one each in East Timor and Australia.

Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas RPN Singh told the Lok Sabha in a written reply that RIL had estimated 10.3 Tcf of recoverable reserves in the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas field in the KG-D6 block. &amp;quot;Subsequently, the contractor (RIL) revised the estimates of recoverable reserves of D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields as 3.10 Tcf,&amp;quot; he said. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the biggest of the 18 finds RIL has made in the deep-sea block in Bay of Bengal, had begun production in April 2009 and had produced 2 Tcf of gas during past three years. MA oilfield in the same KG-D6 block was estimated to hold 681.4 Billion cubic feet (Bcf) of recoverable gas reserves and RIL has now revised the numbers to 788 Bcf, he said. Singh said the block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 produced 15.106 bcm of gas in 2009-10 which rose to 20.4 bcm in 2010-11. But in the subsequent year, it fell to 15.611 bcm. The fall in output was because one-third of the 18 gas producer wells in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields &amp;quot;ceased to produce gas due to water/sand ingress in well bores,&amp;quot; he said, adding on MA field, two of the six wells had ceased due to same reasons. &amp;quot;The operator (RIL) has attributed lower gas production as compared to approved plan from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields to unforeseen geological surprises and reservoir,&amp;quot; Singh said. The Directorate General of Hydrocarbon has attributed the fall in output to &amp;quot;non-drilling of the required number of gas producer wells in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields by the contract in line with the Addendum to Initial Development Plan (AIDP),&amp;quot; he said. In the AIDP, RIL had committed to drill 31 wells and produce 80 million standard cubic meters per day of gas by this time of the year. But, output is currently less than 29 mmscmd. "

The matter would now go to Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM), the order said.  Earlier in the day, Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy, who hails from Andhra Pradesh, tried to justify the decision saying it was taken by an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) in 2008.But it was oil ministry which had in 2010 forced RIL to sign contracts for more than the projected output from KG-D6 fields saying pro-rata cut on all customers can be applied in case production lags supply commitments. &amp;quot;There is severe shortage in availability of gas in the case of KG basin.

Faced with an unanticipated sharp decline in KG-D6 gas production, the government had last year ordered a pro-rata cut in supplies to 25 power plants which had an original allocation of 28.90 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd). But there was no cut in the 15.668 mmscmd allocation to 16 fertiliser plants, who were given top priority in gas allocation. Sources said Ratnagiri Gas &amp;amp;amp; Power Pvt Ltd (RGPPL), the firm that now runs the 1,967 MW power plant at Dabhol in Maharashtra, was allocated 7.6 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas. It like other power plants, however, got only 40% of allocated volumes. The Ministry in its July 31 order cited an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) decision of February 24 to order RIL to supply RGPPL 7.6 mmscmd of gas in full, sources said, adding it was not clear what took the ministry over five months to communicate the decision of the ministerial panel. KG-D6 output has fallen to about 29 mmscmd this month, of which just about 12 mmscmd was being supplied to power plants. The supplies to power plant include those to RGPPL. After the ministry's July 31 order, RGPPL will get 7.6 mmscmd, leaving under 5 mmscmd to be divided among the 24 other power plants. KG-D6 gas output has fallen from 61.5 mmscmd in March 2010 to under 29 mmscmd. Of the current output, over 14 mmscmd is sold to fertiliser plants and about 3 mmscmd goes to LPG extraction plants, leaving 12 mmscmd for power plants. Sources said the EGoM in its meeting on February 24 directed supply of full quota of gas to RGPPL after Power Ministry made a request. Power ministry argued that the beleaguered Dabhol power plant after the exit of its bankrupt owner Enron Corp of US, was granted 'top most priority' in allocation of KG-D6 gas at par with the fertiliser sector by the EGoM while making original allocation on October 23, 2008. Following from that decision, no cut should be made in supplies to RGPPL till cuts for the fertliser sector starts, it had argued. According to the power ministry, substantial cuts in the supply of KG-D6 gas to RGPPL has been observed from November 2011, onwards, despite the fact that no cut has been started for the fertiliser sector till date. Sources said Andhra Pradesh has lodged a strong protest against the RGPPL allocation, claiming that this will hurt power plants in the state, as they are already operating at a lower plant load factor (PLF) of 52% as against the 75% PLF mandated by the EGoM."

RIL's 55 promoters currently comprise of six individuals, including its chief Mukesh Ambani and his family members, one trust and 48 corporate bodies. The family members include Mukesh Ambani's mother Kokila Dhirubhai Ambani, wife Nita Ambani and children Isha, Akash and Anant, although their holdings are minuscule. Almost three-fourth of the total promoter holding is owned through LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) firms, which are globally considered as among the most tax-efficient corporate structures for holding companies. Out of the total of 48 corporate bodies forming part of RIL's promoter group, as many as 29 are LLPs. All the promoters together hold about 45% stake in RIL, out of which more than 33% are held through these LLPs."

We would like to call meeting (of the EGoM) as early as possible,&amp;quot; Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy told reporters here. The EGoM was reconstituted last month after its previous head Pranab Mukherjee resigned as Finance Minister to become the President. Antony previously was not part of the EGoM and has been included after Mukherjee's exit.  The Finance Ministry will now be represented by Minister of State for Finance Namo Narain Meena on the EGoM. Besides Antony and Meena, the EGoM includes Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy, Power Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, Fertiliser and Chemicals Minister M K Alagiri, Law and Justice Minister Salman Khurshid and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. RIL has demanded a market price of KG-D6 gas instead of USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit rate fixed for five years ending March 31, 2014. &amp;quot;The EGoM (at its last meeting in February) had directed us to seek an opinion of the Attorney General G E Vahanvati if prices can be revised before the 5-year tenure fixed by the government,&amp;quot; an official said. &amp;quot;We have received the opinion of AG on the price of RIL gas and it will now be put up before EGoM for a decision,&amp;quot; he added. The nation's highest law officer has opined that the contract for KG-D6 does not mandate any fixed period during which the approved price would remain valid. AG felt that revision of prices is advisable or not is a matter which the EGoM would have to determine not as a matter of law, but as a matter of policy. The official said the Oil Ministry will not recommend price change before April 1, 2014. Meanwhile, RIL has submitted a proposal to price KG-D6 gas at import parity from April 2014 and not with immediate effect. The government had in 2007 approved USD 4.205 per mmBtu price for KG-D6 gas for first five years of production. RIL began output from KG-D6 on April 1, 2009. The company, which has seen output halve to less than 30 million standard cubic meters per day in past two years, is seeking market price which will help it deploy deepsea technologies to exploit difficult sections of the reservoir.  India imports liquefied natural gas (LNG) at three times the price fixed for KG-D6 gas and RIL is seeking that price for the eastern offshore fields. The Oil Ministry is, however, opposed to any revision in rates before timeline fixed by the EGoM. "

The Reliance Industry (RIL) results for the Q1 FY 13 have been slightly better than the estimates. 2. There is definite positive surprise on the GRM (Gross Refining Margins). The estimated GRM was about US&amp;amp;#36; 7 per barrel, but the company has posted GRM of US&amp;amp;#36; 7.6 per barrel. That&rsquo;s definitely positive during this quarter. Singapore GRMs during the quarter were about US&amp;amp;#36; 6.6 per barrel. Hence, the Reliance has posted about US&amp;amp;#36; 1 per barrel premium over Singapore GRMS, which is significant premium. Reliance has got such a healthy premium about 3 quarters back. So, this is a definite improvement from the company point of view. 3. One more interesting aspect of the financials is the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; segment. The proportion of &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; has reduced to 35% of the overall Profit Before Tax. This is a reduction from the 42% share in the previous quarter. This indicates that the Quality of Profits has increased in case of Reliance from the Operation Profit point of view. 4. The company has aggressively started the buyback with about Rs 2000 Crores of buyback already completed. Further, one can expect that the company will go more aggressively in the coming quarters with buyback. This can reduce the overall cash balance of the company. Hence, one can expect further reduction of share of Other Income in the future quarters as well. 5. To summarize, in this quarter, Reliance has made more money from refining and less money from Money.

However, as has been the case in the last couple of quarters, analysts expect the company's profit to receive some support from other income, which is largely derived from treasury operations utilizing the excess cash on its books. A consensus of estimates by various brokerages have pegged consolidated net profit to decline around 22% to Rs 4,400 crore,YoY and sales are expected to rise around 5% to Rs 85,300 crore. RIL will report earnings for the June quarter on Friday. Check out CNBC-TV18's estimates on RIL Brokerages say these are the factors which will impact RIL&rsquo;s Q1 numbers &amp;amp;nbsp;*Crude throughput to be approximately 17 million metric tonnes as against 16.8 mmt, YoY. &amp;amp;nbsp;*KG-DG output has averaged at 34 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) from 49 mmscmd, YoY. &amp;amp;nbsp;*Gross refining margins (GRM) or the difference between the cost of crude and the price of refined products is estimated to be around USD 7/bbl versus USD 10.3/bbl, YoY. In its earnings preview note, Bank of America Merill Lynch said: &amp;quot;Our concern is that global economic downturn may hit RIL's GRM and petrochem margins. Thus, the company&rsquo;s earnings may deteriorate in FY13. Weakness in refining and petrochemicals was already visible in 2H FY12,&amp;quot; said the firm. BofaML believes that the improvement in outlook is likely if GRM from coke gasification rises, fundamentals better, gas price is increased, petrochemical capacity is expanded and gas output recovers. &amp;amp;nbsp;The firm sees a 24% YoY fall in RIL&rsquo;s profit in April-June, and 14%YoY decline in annualised earnings per share during the quarter. The company stock has declined 3.5% when compared to the 4% rise in Sensex since Jan 2012. Motilal Oswal and Angel Broking too expect declining KG-D6 output and weak petchem margins to wear down profits for the quarter. Topline, however, would grow marginally because of higher refining and petchem volumes, says K.R Choksey in a note. &amp;amp;nbsp;Independent analyst S.P Tulsian expects a marginal increase of 30-50 bps in GRMs which can surprise markets.

The Oil Ministry stated that RIL had violated the production sharing contract (PSC) and willfully drilled fewer wells than what it had committed in its approved plan, Amended Initial Development Plan (AIDP). However, RIL had stated earlier that unexpected geology had resulted in lower gas production. Further, RIL maintained that the production sharing contract allows for operators to recover 100% of the capital and operating expenditures on an oil and gasfield and does not link the cost recovery to production. Hence, it has challenged the Oil Ministry's order."

Days before a 60-day deadline for approval of RIL's import parity pricing of gas to be produced from below coal-seams (CBM) expired, the Ministry on July 12 asked the company to explain the fixed component in the pricing formula, sources said. The query on inclusion of USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit in the formula is repeat of what the ministry had asked RIL on April 24. RIL had on February 21 submitted a proposal seeking a price of equivalent to 12.67 per cent of price of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude oil, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, for the CBM it plans to produce from Madhya Pradesh blocks from end-2014. In response to the Ministry's April 24 query, RIL on April 26 sent a detailed 6 page reply stating that the CBM contract provides for pricing the gas at best available arms length rate for similar sales in the region. Sources said RIL stated its proposed formula is exact replica of the rate paid by customers in the region for purchase of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a long term contract. CBM contract provides for approval of the sale price formula within 60 business days &amp;quot;from the date of receipt of proposal or from the date of receipt of clarifications / additional information&amp;quot;. The Ministry's April 24 clarifications pushed back the approval clock by another two months and the same thing has happened with the recent July 12 query. Sources said RIL had in February called for open offers for price discovery according to the formula after informing all the concerned ministeries of power, fertiliser, chemical and petrochemical besides oil. Neither oil ministry nor any other ministry or state government raised any objections to call for offers for price discovery. The delay in the CBM price approval is seriously hampering the development and production of CBM which would annually substitute imported liquid fuels worth about USD 1 billion or substitute USD 650 million of LNG imports, sources said. RIL got a demand of 20.63 million standard cubic meters a day (six times the gas available for sale) in the open bids called in February based on which the company sought approval of the formula."

According to the research firm, for 1QFY2013, net sales of companies are expected to increase broadly, mainly driven by higher volume growth. During 1QFY2013, average Brent crude oil price fell by 8.7% qoq on account of adverse news flow from the troubled Eurozone. Further, average WTI crude oil price decreased by 9.3%, broadly reflecting the fall in Brent crude oil price. Henry Hub natural gas price declined by 5.6% qoq due to rising production of shale gas (thus rising inventories) and warmer summer. However, Asian spot LNG prices continued to remain high on account of demand-supply mismatch in Asia. Prices of petrochemical products, on the other hand, remained flat on a qoq basis during 1QFY2013. During April and May 2012, Indian crude oil basket for oil prices stood at US&amp;amp;#36;118/bbl and US&amp;amp;#36;108/bbl, respectively. Despite INR depreciation against the USD, the steep decline has resulted in lower under-recoveries for oil marketing companies (OMCs) on account of selling diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG at subsidized rates. During the first half of June 2012, OMCs continued to lose Rs 446cr per day compared to Rs 563cr per day in April 2012. OMCs continued to lose Rs 10.2/liter, Rs 30.5/liter and Rs 396/cylinder on diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG, respectively, during the first half of June 2012. Mixed 1QFY2013 performance by O&amp;amp;amp;G stocksDuring 1QFY2013, BSE Oil and Gas (O&amp;amp;amp;G) Index recorded a moderate decrease of 0.5%, although BSE Sensex was positive by 0.1%. After a rise during 4QFY2012, oil and gas stocks again fell during April and May 2012, in-line with the fall in broader markets. However, the stocks increased during June 2012. Cairn India stock fell steeply on June 29, 2012, after Cairn Energy sold its 3.5% stake by way of bulk deal in the open market. RIL stock fell during April and May 2012, but increased in June 2012 due to the ongoing buyback program by promoters. GAIL stock declined during 1QFY2013, reflecting the decrease in KG-D6 gas production and higher international gas prices. ONGC was the outperformer in the oil and gas sector. The stock increased substantially in June 2012, after it posted better-than-expected 4QFY2012 results. 1QFY2013 expectationsFor 1QFY2013, we expect net sales of companies under our coverage to increase broadly, mainly driven by higher volume growth. We expect ONGC's net sales to increase by 20.2% yoy on account of higher realization. ONGC's PAT is expected to increase by 31.4% yoy. For RIL, we expect the top line to decrease modestly by 0.2%. However, its bottom line is expected to decrease by 28.0% yoy mainly due to lower production from KG-D6 block. GAIL is expected to report 20.7% yoy topline growth on account of higher volumes. However, its net profit is expected to decrease by 23.0% yoy due to higher interest and depreciation expenses.

RIL has sought a price equivalent to imported LNG from April 1, 2014, when the current below-market rate of USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu)&amp;amp;nbsp;expires. &amp;quot;The empowered group of ministers (EGoM) on natural gas pricing and utilisation will decide on the issue,&amp;quot; he said. The EGoM was previously headed by Pranab Mukherjee, who resigned in June as finance minister to contest the Presidential polls, and the panel is yet to be reconstituted. No new head of the EGoM has been announced. RIL had on June 15 written to the oil ministry proposing to price natural gas it produces from the Krishna-Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal at a rate equivalent to price India pays for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG). The government had in 2007 fixed a price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu for gas from KG-D6 block for first five years of production. KG-D6 fields began production on April 1, 2009 and the current price expires on March 31, 2014. From April, 2014, RIL wants the gas to be price at import parity just as domestically produced crude oil is priced. Sources said the firm has submitted the pricing formula or basis a good 21 months before the new rates come into effect, so that the government has ample time to approve it. RIL wants to price KG-D6 gas at 12.67% of JCC, or Japan Customs-Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. At USD 100 per barrel oil price, gas will cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. This formula is different from the one that was approved in 2007.  _PAGEBREAK_ According to this formula, KG-D6 gas price was capped at crude oil price of USD 60 per barrel, translating into asale price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu. KG-D6 gas at USD 60 a barrel oil price, according to the new formula, would be priced at USD 7.862 per mmBtu. Sources said the formula proposed a true arms'length market price as it is the same that the government has approved for import of LNG. The formula proposed by RIL is the same at which Petronet LNG Ltd, the nation's largest liquefied natural gas importer,buys 7.5 million tonne per annum of LNG from RasGas of Qatar. RasGas charges 12.67% of JCC and Petronet pays a further USD 0.26 per mmBtu for shipping the gas in its liquid form (LNG) from Qatar. KG-D6 output has almost halved to about 31.5 million standard cubic meters per day in the last two years due to unexpected drop in reservoir pressure and increased water and sand ingress in wells.  RIL believes fields outside currently producing ones can contribute 30-35 mmscmd to the output. "

However, the fund raising plan is amusing, said an&amp;amp;nbsp; nalyst, who wished not to be named, as the company is sitting on a cash pile of over Rs 76,000 crore as of FY12.

Corporate earnings results, and more importantly, the guidance given could be key in determining whether India's main stock indices can sustain their double digit gains this year. The rallies have come despite challenging fiscal and economic outlooks that have dented the rupee currency. A shortfall of nearly 50% of the average rainfalls in the seasonal monsoon period so far has become the latest domestic worry, given worries about the impact on rural consumers. BofA-ML says SBI, ICICI Bank , HDFC Bank , Infosys and Tata Motors are expected to be the key contributors of growth.

Compressed natural gas (CNG) in Delhi will cost Rs 38.35 per kg with effect from midnight tonight, Indraprastha Gas Ltd, the sole retailer of CNG and piped natural gas in the national capital, said in a press statement here today. Earlier the price was increased by Rs 1.75 per kg on January 1 and by Rs 1.90 per kg later on March 6. IGL, which hiked price of CNG sold to automobiles in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad by Rs 3.30 per kg to Rs 43.10 per kg, said the increase was necessitated because of fall in value of rupee and rise in cost of imported gas. The hike had been necessitated because IGL is buying more of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) after supplies from Reliance Industries' KG-D6 gas fields dried up. Imported fuel costs at least three times more than USD 4.20 per million British thermal unit rate fixed for domestic gas. City gas distributors like IGL are not getting any supplies from KG-D6 since September last year, after a 40% output drop forced the government to cut supplies to non-priority sectors so that requirement of power and fertiliser plants can be fully met. &amp;quot;IGL is constrained to announce increase in the price of CNG since the input cost of entire pool of natural gas has risen substantially since the last price revision due to appreciation of dollar vis-&agrave;-vis rupee up to 14% and the increased dependence on imported LNG,&amp;quot; the company said.

India is a tough market for retailers, with same-store sales growth slowing to single digits at many chains. Two years ago, a sales growth of 25% for many fashion retailers open a year or more was not uncommon. Reliance Brands declined to provide such data. &amp;quot;We are different than companies who are driven by valuations and the next round of funding,&amp;quot; said Darshan Mehta, chief executive of Reliance Brands, which sells branded goods in India through joint ventures with foreign companies. Strict local sourcing rules for wholly-owned retail outlets mean nearly all foreign-branded stores operate in India through joint ventures with local partners like Reliance, or franchises. Reliance Brands opened its first store in April 2010 and through March operated about 60 stores under 12 brands including Diesel, Brooks Brothers, Thomas Pink, and Kenneth Cole. It aims to open 40 stores in the year ending in March and plans to sign up more foreign brands, said Mehta, a former stockbroker. While overall profitability is &amp;quot;few years away,&amp;quot; the company's near-term focus is on profitable stores, he said. &amp;quot;We have a powerful parent and a very patient parent and when you have that you can go ahead and build a robust business...irrespective of the challenges,&amp;quot; he said from his office in south Mumbai overlooking the Arabian Sea. Ambani has said he hopes to grow the retail business, which includes 1,300 stores, mostly supermarkets, over the next three to four years. While Ambani is patient, his investors have been less so, with some grumbling at a recent shareholders meeting over the push into retail and telecoms, businesses aimed at cashing in on Indian consumer growth, but where profits are years away. Shares in Reliance are down 27% since the start of 2011, in part on falling output at its main gas field. GROWING ALONE Ambani's retail conviction is not shared by all his rivals. DLF Brands, part of the country's largest real estate developer, debt-laden DLF , recently ended its joint venture with Italy's Giorgio Armani, which was unhappy with the lack of scale offered by its partner, according to industry analysts. Armani recently struck a franchise agreement with Genesis Luxury, a rival to Reliance Brands. India's largest retailer, Future Group, which runs supermarkets and clothing outlets, has scaled back its expansion from 2.5 million to 2 million sqft this fiscal year due to an economy growing at its weakest in nine years. The growth rate was 5.3% on an annual basis in the March quarter. Reliance benefits from rules that once banned full ownership by foreign single-brand retailers. The ban was lifted in January, but a rule that foreign brands must source 30% of their goods from local, small and mid-sized vendors has deterred most foreigners from setting up on their own. Only two overseas retailers - Swedish furniture giant Ikea and Britain's Pavers shoe company - have applied for licences since the rule was changed. Mehta, dressed in a white Thomas Pink shirt and pair of Diesel jeans, said the change in the law does not make India an easy place for newcomers. &amp;quot;Retailers who are not affected by the law also look for partners in India. The law doesn't take away the complexity of the market,&amp;quot; Mehta said. Another hurdle is a 15% fall in the value of the rupee since its yearly high in February, which drives up import prices. &amp;quot;The bigger worry is if, going forward, the economy (worsens). That will have a much larger impact than a Rs 500-price hike,&amp;quot; Mehta said."

Acute shortage of coal for power projects as well as worsening health of distribution companies (discoms) remain major worries for the sector. &amp;quot;The government's and companies' continued inability to address the challenges in the power sector may result in significant NPLs (Non Performing Loans) in banking sector over the next 2-3 years,&amp;quot; brokerage firm Kotak Securities has said. In a recent report, the entity noted that new power projects having a total capacity of 40-50 GW could be in danger of defaulting on their debt obligations. &amp;quot;We estimate the banking system's exposure (including loans from PFC and REC) to the power sector will rise to Rs 9 trillion (Rs 9 lakh crore) by the end of FY 2015 from Rs 5.3 trillion (Rs 5.3 lakh crore) at the end of FY 2012 (19% CAGR in FY 2012-15E),&amp;quot; the report noted. PFC and REC are leading state-run lenders to the power sector. Pointing out that the central government's effort to address coal-supply and pricing challenges &amp;quot;is quite timid,&amp;quot; it said that a sharp rise is expected in NPLs in power generation sector as well as increase in SEB (State Electricity Board) losses over the next 2-3 years. &amp;quot;We see several new power generation projects as being unable to meet their debt obligations. Banks may not recognise them as NPLs under various guises but the magnitude of the problem is too large for any quick-fix solution,&amp;quot; it said. Even though, the government is taking initiatives to ease fuel supply scenario for the power sector, many existing and upcoming projects are faced with severe coal shortage. Amid rising concerns about defaults in the banking system, the government is working on plans to restructure the debtburden of state discoms. The precarious health of discoms has been mainly blamed on lower tariff realisation and efficiency issues."

Mukesh Ambani-led RIL that began a buyback programme of Rs 10,440 crore early this year, has so far purchased shares to the tune of Rs 1,929 crore through open market transaction. &amp;quot;We have, to date, bought back 2.7 crore shares at a cost of Rs 1,929 crore - this represents 22.5 per cent of the cap set by the Board in terms of number of shares,&amp;quot; RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said while addressing to the company's shareholders. &amp;quot;The buyback represents highly accretive use of cash by the company. It will supplement earnings growth from operations, for higher EPS, (earning per share)in the near future. &amp;quot;We are also reinvesting our cash flows at accelerated pace in new projects and new businesses. These will bear fruition and growth in earnings over the next few years,&amp;quot; he added. Although, the buyback started in February, it gained momentum last month, when it has bought maximum shares. Market experts are of opinion that the oil and gas giant is buying back shares aggressively from the open market with an aim to shore up stock valuations. However, the buyback programme appears to have provided little respite to the stock price, which has fallen around over 15% since the share repurchase offer announced, under performing the benchmark Sensex that has declined more than 6% during the period. Although, RIL had gained over six per cent since it touched 52-week low of Rs 671 on May 8. The stock had received a setback after credit rating agency Moody's downgraded RIL as credit negative following the downward revision in the company's assessment of natural gas reserve. RIL shares were trading at Rs 723.05 today, which is much below the maximum price of Rs 870 per share fixed for buyback. &amp;quot;Reliance has underperformed the markets during last few years. It is not able to perform on the back of the falling output from KG&ndash;D6. The progress of work seems to be very slow. &amp;quot;Another problem with the Reliance is that it is not able to use cash reserves in a very effective manner,&amp;quot; Wellindia Vice-President Research Vivek Negi said. &amp;quot;Fundamentally, the company is still doing average. But there is no clarity on the future prospects of the company,&amp;quot; he added. RIL's Rs 10,440-crore buyback offer could be the biggest ever in the history of Indian capital market. The buyback programme, which commenced on February 7, is scheduled to continue till January 19, 2013."

Controversial technocrat V K Sibal was the head of Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) which gave RIL approvals for raising the cost on the plea that gas reserves as well as cost of services have gone up.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Operators like RIL are allowed to recover all their cost before sharing profits with the government. Higher capital cost directly impacts the government's revenue. The agency had registered a preliminary enquiry into the case in November 2009 on request of the Oil Ministry following several objections raised by CVC on the KG-D6 deal. CBI sources said that probe has been completed in connection with the case and the matter has been referred to the Attorney General seeking legal opinion in the matter. During its probe, the agency had taken the ministry's assistance to understand the arguments offered by Reliance when it raised the cost of developing Dhirubhai 1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block from USD 2.39 billion proposed in 2004 to USD 5.196 billion in Phase-1 and another USD 3.3 billion in Phase-II.  With exploration and production of oil and gas from deep sea being complex issues, the agency had used the expertise of a domain expert to understand if the expenses proposed by Reliance and approved by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) were justified. Besides, CBI also probed why DGH allowed Reliance to retain the entire KG-D6 block in alleged contravention of the policy that stipulates relinquishing 25 per cent of the area every year. The Central Vigilance Commission had forwarded a complaint in which it was alleged that there was a phenomenal increase in capital expenditure in the project. Reliance had said in a statement, &amp;quot;As aesponsible operator, it has fully complied with the requirements in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) at all times in conducting petroleum operations, and refutes any suggestion to thecontrary. The KG-D6 project has been globally acclaimed for its cost effective, speedy, flawless execution and smooth commissioning.&amp;quot; "

Relogistics Infrastructure Ltd (Relog), a subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani's RGTIL, had in 2007-08 won government authorisation to lay Kakinada-Basudebpur-Howrah pipeline, Kakinada-Chennai line, Chennai-Bangalore-Mangalore pipeline and Chennai-Tuticorin line but physical work on these pipelines haven't yet started. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB)has written to the Oil Ministry recommending cancellation of the authorisation over delays in implementation of the pipelines, a top PNGRB official said. &amp;quot;The Board has taken a view of recommending cancellation of authorisation for the four pipelines. That has been communicated to the government,&amp;quot; he said, adding the licences were given by the government prior to PNGRB began functional and so its cancellation can now be done only by the Ministry. Relog has cited uncertaintly about availability of gas for not building the lines that as per the original authorisation were to be build in three years from date of all approvals. The three year period expires this month. The official said Relog has also refused to furnish bank gurantee, which can be confiscated if the company did not complete the pipeline within the given timeframe. RGTIL says it built the 1,396-km East-West pipeline from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Bharuch in Gujarat to ferry natural gas from eastern offshore KG-D6 fields, in record time. And it is &amp;quot;fully equipped&amp;quot; to complete the four pipelines in 24 months, but wants to synchronise the construction with gas sourcing. The company claims that while demand can be perhaps generated, sourcing of gas is a problem.Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 field output has dropped to 32 million standard cubic meters per day instead of rising to 80 mmscmd.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; KG-D6 and other eastern offshore gas fields were supposed to be the source of fuel for the pipelines but in view of falling output and no other field coming on stream in near future, the pipeline work has been delayed, it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; As per the original authorisation, the pipelines were to be completed within 36 months of the notification of expression of interest or 24 months from the date of 100% availability of right of user (RoU), whichever is later. The twin deadlines expire between June to August for the four pipelines. The official said PNGRB has not yet taken any view on the authorisations granted by state-owned GAIL India Ltd. "

Reliance generates up to USD 1 billion in free cash every quarter and held USD 13.8 billion at end-March, far more than it can put to work under existing investment plans or through an ongoing share buyback programme. &amp;quot;Earlier, investors gave them the benefit of doubt that cash was being deployed in high-margin businesses, but people are questioning that now,&amp;quot; said Michiel van Voorst, a portfolio manager for Asia-Pacific Equities at Robeco Hong Kong. Those questions are likely to get an airing at the company's annual shareholder's meeting on Thursday. Reliance has cooled in its hunt for acquisitions in North American shale gas as US natural gas prices have plunged. At home, investment in its gas blocks has stalled as output slows and it battles the government over gas pricing. The company has so far acquired less than a quarter of the USD 2.1 billion of shares it plans to buy back from investors, even as it raises debt to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Reliance makes much of its plans to spend USD 12 billion over the next few years to boost capacity at its petrochemicals plant and refinery complex, the world's largest, in western India. However, such projects are typically funded about 70% from debt, which leaves plenty of low-yielding cash left over. Last year, Ambani outlined a big drive into consumer-focused businesses, looking to take advantage of rising spending power in Asia's third-largest economy. The problem for investors is that the retail business is loss-making even after six years and Reliance is spending billions to get into a fiercely competitive and unpredictable telecoms sector, with returns a distant and uncertain prospect. &amp;quot;I think most investors feel Reliance should concentrate and not go everywhere, not diversify in every direction,&amp;quot; said Taina Erajuuri, portfolio manager at FIM India in Helsinki. &amp;quot;They've been burning cash on some investments, which I'm not happy (about),&amp;quot; added Erajuuri, who has sold her Reliance shares in the past year. FALLING RETURNS Reliance is widely credited with having one of the savviest treasury operations in corporate India. As returns have dwindled from core businesses, the proportion of profits from its treasury has surged, accounting for as much as 42% in the March quarter, roughly triple the share until a year ago. Return on capital slipped to 11.4% in January-March from 13.8% two years ago. While the slowdown in its energy businesses contributed to that decline, treasury gains also weigh on returns. Its cash pile is about three times what it was two years ago, following the USD 7.2 billion sale last year of 30% in some of its oil and gas blocks to BP Plc. The bulk of Reliance's cash, held in bank deposits, corporate debt and government securities, has an estimated return of 9-11%. The interest cost on its long-term borrowings is 6-8%, giving it treasury gains of around 3 percentage points. The cash hoard has not deterred Reliance from raising more debt. Last month, it raised USD 2 billion in a 13-year loan, taking its debt raisings in the last four months to nearly USD 4 billion and increasing its gross debt to USD 15.4 billion. It is seeking another USD 1 billion loan for capital spending, sources told Thomson Reuters publication Basis Point. &amp;quot;They're generating more profit from cash than from exploration, and almost equal to gains from refining,&amp;quot; said SP Tulsian, an independent market strategist in Mumbai. &amp;quot;Even if these returns are good, is it a comfortable situation?&amp;quot; END OF GROWTH CYCLE? At this week's AGM, Ambani could face questions on the gradually weakening performance in the company's core energy businesses, and on the lack of profits from its push into consumer-focused businesses. Its retail business continues to lose money and, despite 1,300 stores, the company is nowhere close to the scale it aimed for at the time of its launch. Reliance is also spending heavily on telecoms and in January invested in TV18 media group. Investors complain Reliance is looking to bet its future, and its cash, on newer businesses that have long gestation periods, and may see returns flow only after 4-5 years. They are voting with their feet. Reliance shares fell by a third last year. The stock trades near a three-year low and its market value has sunk to below USD 41 billion, dumping Ambani from the top of Asia's rich-list. Tata Consultancy Services, part of arch-rival Tata Group, has unseated it as India's most valuable listed company. Sluggish global growth and a tough regulatory and investment climate at home mean many Indian firms such as Coal India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Infosys have shunned deals and now sit on mounting cash. Reliance's cash-pile is not far short of much larger global energy majors such as Shell with USD 15 billion, Chevron with USD 18.8 billion and Exxon Mobil with USD 21.8 billion. Apple Inc has a record USD 110 billion in cash. &amp;quot;Globally, you're seeing many oil and gas companies giving very high dividends. But that also means admitting they have come to the end of a high growth cycle,&amp;quot; said Robeco's van Voorst. &amp;quot;I don't know if Reliance is willing to admit that.&amp;quot;"

With output from KG-D6 continuing to decline, RIL was against signing new Gas Sale and Purchase Agreements (GSPA) as meeting new supply commitments would have meant cutting gas supplies to existing power plants. But under intense pressure from Delhi government and oil ministry, RIL has now agreed to sign GSPAs for supply of 2.16 million standard cubic meters per day to Delhi's Bawana power project and NTPC, industry sources said. RIL has informed the Delhi government and Pragati Power Corp of its intention to sign GSPA for supply of 0.93 mmsmcd of gas and has forwarded a draft agreement. KG-D6 fields had seen drop from 61.5 mmscmd in March, 2010, to about 32 mmscmd, forcing pro-rata cuts on customers. Sources said the new pacts would mean supplies to 25 power plants who were allocated gas from Krishna Godavari basin fields, further going down. Private power producer Lanco has already warned of power plants, which are currently operating at less than 38%, shutting down if supplies are cut any further. Supplying gas to Bawana and NTPC would mean supplies would further reduce to uneconomical levels of 20-25%. While the KG-D6 gas supplies dropped, the pro-rata cut was applied only to the 25 power plants which had an original allocation of 28.90 mmcmd. Fertiliser plants, which were allocated about 15 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas, did not face such a cut. Supplies to Pragati Power would mean a further drop in supplies to power plants, sources added."

Company sources said the fall in output from eastern offshore KG-D6 field to 32-33 million standard cubic meters per day from 61.5 mmsmd two years ago was due to geological complexities and reservoir not behaving as predicted. The output has fallen because of water and sand ingress in wells and reservoir outside the main channel not participating in the production, they said, adding such erratic and unpredictable behaviour of something which is 2-km below the seabed forced the company to halt drilling of well and do more studies before putting more investment. All drilling cost is recoverable and if the company had gone for indiscriminate drilling, the government's profit take would have been impacted, they said. &amp;quot;We are not suppressing production. If anything, it is the government which is suppressing price,&amp;quot; one of them said. He said the letter the company got from the government approving USD 4.205 per million British thermal unit as the price of KG-D6 gas, clearly stated that if RIL was to get a higher price than the approved rate, the higher would be used for calculation of profit petroleum etc. This essentially meant that the government was open to RIL selling gas at higher rates, he said adding the company is seeking market price for its gas. RIL blamed the oil ministry for artificially suppressing gas prices paid to domestic producers saying the ministry was happy paying USD 16-18 per million British thermal unit for import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) but does not want domestic companies to be paid remunerative prices. &amp;quot;Need of the hour is to restore contractual sanctity,&amp;quot; a source said citing from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) which guarantees market price and marketing freedom. Sources said the company was eager to resolve the dispute over cost recovery through arbitration and has requested the government to quickly appoint arbitrators. There was no provisions in the PSC to link cost-recovery to production, they said in reference to the notice oil ministry served on RIL disallowing USD 1.005 billion expenditure for failing to drill 9 out of the committed 31 wells. The PSC, they said, allowed operators to recover all their cost from oil and gas production and the ministry move was illegal. The dispute can be settled through arbitration, they added."

Remember these are midcap ideas not just for the day, but stocks that look attractive in the medium-term as well.  This week, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com, Ashish Kapur or Investshoppe and Saurabh Mittal of Swadeshi Credits battle it out for top honours SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com Buy Mahindra Satyam with a target of Rs 71 and keep a stoploss at Rs 65. The company has posted very good numbers for Q4 where an EBITDA margin has increased by 136 bps on a sequential basis with Q4 EBITDA margins placed at 17.54%. The Q4 PAT of Rs 525 crore will be seen quite positive by the market though it includes an exceptional gain of Rs 109 crore and tax ride back of Rs 94 crore but still overall EPS of Rs 11 plus for FY12 will be seen quite positive by the market. Buy Tech Mahindra with a target of Rs 640 and keep a stoploss at Rs 598. The better result posted by Mahindra Satyam will be having a reflection on the share of this company also because Mahindra Satyam is merging with Tech Mahindra on a swap ratio of two shares of Tech Mahindra for every 17 shares held in Mahindra Satyam. Even the working to be declared by Tech Mahindra on 23rd May for Q4 is likely to be good.  Buy HDFC Warrants with a target of Rs 54 and keep a stoploss at Rs 44. One warrant entitles the warrant holders to subscribe to one share of HDFC at Rs 600 by August 2012. The stock HDFC has been witnessing renewed buying interest after the MSCI goof up and the positive view on the stock is likely to continue. Hence this seems a very good arbitrage play of buying HDFC Warrant instead of HDFC shares. Buy Shalimar Paints with a target of Rs 524 and keep a stoploss at Rs 473. The stock has yesterday seen the informed buying and in fact for last one week the share has been seeing the delivery based informed buying largely because of the better Q4 numbers having posted by the company with EPS of close to about Rs 16 and EPS of close to about Rs 39 for FY12. But it is learnt that the stake sell by the promoters are likely to happen in the near future and hence the share is seen under accumulation by the informed circle. Disclaimer: He has a holding in HDFC Warrants. Stocks discussed may have been recommended to clients. _PAGEBREAK_  Ashish Kapur or Investshoppe Buy DB Realty with a target of Rs 79 and keep a stoploss at Rs 71.50. This company has got beaten down very badly over the last one year due to various controversies surrounding it including the telecom scam. But all that seems to be passed with release of Mr. Balwa. I think the fact is that this company is available now at a very cheap valuation. It has a lot of prime residential space especially in south and Central Mumbai which augers very well because that is a premium part of Mumbai. So we feel that all the negatives are already factored in.  Buy Max India with a target of Rs 208 and keep a stoploss at Rs 189. The company is slowly and steadily getting out of its unrelated businesses like polypropylene film, specialty films division and that&rsquo;s going to result in a significant cash flow for the company. Second is that New York life recently exited the company and sold its stake to Mitsui Sumitomo. The value of the business of Max India is nearly the same as market value of the total company.  Short JSW Steel with a target of Rs 568 and keep a stoploss at Rs 622. We remain bearish on JSW Steel because this is one company which has a very high leverage on its balance sheet, is not fully integrated. So we will get impacted by the rising or any change in the cost of raw materials. Also the company is yet to recover fully from the impact of the mining ban in Karnataka. Though there has been a resolution to it but by the time the issue is completely resolved it may take some more time.  Short Patel Engineering with a target of Rs 80 and keep a stoploss at Rs 88.50. Patel Engineering is one infrastructure company where the future looks very bleak at least for the near term. The company is carrying a huge amount of debt. Has a stretched working capital cycle and also many of their projects are facing rough weather and they have been in news recently for wrong reasons. So there is ample reason to believe that any weakness in the market would result in further slippage in prices of Patel Engineering. Very safe stock to go short on if you want to hedge your portfolio.  Disclaimer: He holds Max India and JSW Steel. _PAGEBREAK_  Saurabh Mittal of Swadeshi Credits Buy Unitech with a target of Rs 23 and keep a stoploss at Rs 20.50. Unitech showed some strength couple of trading sessions back and it has taken a big beating in the last couple of months and I think it&rsquo;s ready for a technical bounce once the market behaves or if there is a technical bounce in the market I think Unitech will show decent appreciation.  Buy Tata Global with a target of Rs 112 and keep a stoploss at Rs 105. Tata Global is also one of those stocks that trades between a range of about an Rs 100-120 and has fallen and it showed some strength couple of trading sessions back. So I expect this to go up with the market for another three or four percentage points in today&rsquo;s trade. Buy Reliance Industries with a target of Rs 700 and keep a stoploss at Rs 678. Reliance Industries also has not performed well for the last few months and I think all the bad news is out for the stock. It has started showing some strength in the last couple of trading sessions and the markets were down, this stock held up and I expect it to show some further strength for today&rsquo;s trade. Short BPCL with a target of Rs 728 and keep a stoploss at Rs 745. BPCL and the oil marketing companies have shown decent strength with the fall in crude prices overseas. I think that has played out for a while and you might see some sort of profit booking and a little bit of downside for these stocks. So for today&rsquo;s trade I am shorting BPCL.

Sources further say that the oil ministry is yet to formally discuss the price hike. Also, the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) will take up the law ministry's opinion when it meets next. In the existing formula for the KG-D6 gas price, crude price has been capped at &amp;amp;#36;60 even if you take &amp;amp;#36;120 as the price of crude. The gas price as per this approved formula comes to only &amp;amp;#36;4.48/mmbtu. With the law ministry opining that the KG-D6 gas price can be revised, we should perhaps expect RIL submitting a new formula in the past. In the past it has asked the government to increase the gas price to &amp;amp;#36;6.  RIL has been arguing its gas is the cheapest in the country and at par with APM gas. Other refiners like Essar Oil get over &amp;amp;#36;4 for their gas. If you go by the approved KG-D6 price formula, the gas price comes to only &amp;amp;#36;4.48.  It may be noted that RIL and its partner BP were seeking a higher gas prices and the oil ministry was against hiking price and had said hiking price would increase subsidy burden. It may&amp;amp;nbsp; also be recalled that in January this year, RIL had given the government 90 days to arrive at a decision over the pricing of gas and had stated that the current price of gas was no longer viable. In February, the government had rejected RIL's demand for a revision in the KG-D6 gas price, saying the USD 4.2 per mmBtu rate for five years was not only agreed to by company but also upheld by the Supreme Court (SC). The Ministry on January&amp;amp;nbsp; wrote to RIL quoting from the May 7, 2010, Supreme Court judgement in the gas row between the company and Anil Ambani's Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) to assert that &amp;quot;any price revision proposal will be examined by the government after expiry of five years from commencement of supply.&amp;quot; By this logic RIL can revise price only after 2012 as it started gas production from the block in April 2009  &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Reliance said in a statement late on Friday that the oil ministry has proposed to &amp;quot;disallow certain costs&amp;quot;, without quantifying how much the company was planning to recover. These &amp;quot;issues will be resolved through arbitration process&amp;quot; initiated by the company in November, it said. The ministry has so far refused to join the arbitration. Reliance &amp;quot;continues to maintain that a contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the production sharing contract and there are no provisions that entitle the government to disallow recovery of any contract cost,&amp;quot; the company said. The petroleum ministry has allowed Reliance to recover costs only for building infrastructure used for gas production and not for the wells that have not been drilled and have not added to output, the oil ministry source told reporters. Reliance is currently producing about 27 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) from its key natural gas field in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin, the source said, far lower than the 80 mmscmd gas it had planned to produce from April this year. Under India's exploration policy, the government allows companies to first recover their cost from oil and gas revenue, and subsequently share profits with the government. Reliance's growth outlook has been marred by falling gas output from its huge gas fields, with production less than half of what was originally estimated. The Comptroller and Auditor General last year criticised both Reliance and the government over development of the KG gas field, and the company's shares slumped by a third in 2011. The company has earlier said unexpected geology has caused the decline in output and drilling more wells would not help, but this has been rejected by the oil ministry."

Gas output from KG-D6 in the week ended April 1 dropped to 33.89 mmscmd from 34.09 mmscmd in the previous week, according to a status report filed by the company with the Oil Ministry. KG-D6, where water and sand ingress coupled with drop in pressure has led a drastic fall in per-well output, had produced 34.62 mmscmd in the begging of March. Production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3, the largest among the 19 oil and gas finds RIL has made in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, slipped to 27.52 mmscmd during March 26 and April 1.

Together with 6.37 mmscmd output from MA oilfield in the same block, KG-D6 produced 33.89 mmsmcd during the week ending April 1. The KG-D6 output has fallen since hitting peak of 61.5 mmscmd in March 2010 as RIL shut wells after wells on water and sand ingress. During the week under review, &amp;quot;total 12 wells were on production and 6 wells (A2, A6, A10, B1, B2 &amp;amp;amp; B13) were kept closed due to high water cut/sanding issues,&amp;quot; the report said. The output from KG-D6 is short of the 70.39 mmscmd-level (61.88 mmscmd from D1 and D3 and 8.5 mmscmd from the MA field) envisaged by now as per the field development plan approved in 2006. While Reliance holds 60% interest in KG-D6, UK's BP Plc holds 30% and Niko Resources of Canada the remaining 10%. The report said one out of the six well on MA field had to be shut due to water loading. The field produced an average of 11,071 barrels per day of oil in the week and 1,627 barrels per day of condensate. Of the 33.89 mmscmd of production, 12.71 mmscmd was sold to fertiliser plants at government approved rate of USD 4.20 per million British thermal unit. Another 18.10 mmscmd was sold to power plants and the remaining 3.08 mmscmd was consumed sectors such as LPG. RIL projected an output of 33.7 mmscmd during the month."

Essar has just completed a USD 1.6 billion overhaul and expansion at the Vadinar refinery, raising capacity to around 360,000 barrels per day from 280,000 bpd and adding units that can process cheaper, heavier crude into fuels. The refinery would reach 400,000 bpd capacity in September, Managing Director Lalit Kumar Gupta said. &amp;quot;The difference in our margins and those in our neighbouring refinery, which is as complex as we are today, has been about USD 3 to USD 4/bbl. We should be able to bridge that gap now,&amp;quot; Gupta told Reuters in an interview. The refinery would gain another USD 1 a barrel in margins through using a coal-fired power plant to provide electricity, which would save on fuel costs, Gupta said. Essar had earlier forecast a 35% jump in revenues for the fiscal year that started on April 1. Revenues for the previous fiscal year were around &amp;amp;#36;9.5 billion. Essar plans to sell a stake of around 15% by June 2013, as required by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to reduce the stake held by founding shareholders to 75% from nearly 90% now. The company believes its shares are trading below value and the price will improve after investors see it operate the newly expanded refinery for two quarters, Gupta said. That would be a better time for any stake sale, he added. Given the full expansion will be completed in September, that would push any possible stake-sell to close to the deadline. &amp;quot;We will come to market when we are rightly priced. At the current price we think we are heavily undervalued. We see significant upside in our refinery business,&amp;quot; Gupta said. Essar Oil's market valuation stands at USD 1.3 billion and its shares have barely changed so far in 2012, closing on Thursday at Rs 50 a share, a fraction of the peak in 2008 of nearly Rs 356. Essar, 87% owned by London-listed Essar Energy , is one of only two private refiners in India. The other is Reliance Industries, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar and has among the best margins in the industry. Reliance reported gross refining margins of USD 7.60 a barrel for the March quarter, down from USD 9.20 a year ago. Margins Gupta said he expected refinery margins to rise in coming quarters as the northern hemisphere summer driving season demand kicked in and improved profits for making gasoline. &amp;quot;Going forward, once the gasoline cracks are better, margins can only go up,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Definitely complex refineries have to make more margins.&amp;quot; The company is currently negotiating with the government in Gujarat more time to repay a USD 1.24 billion sales tax due after the Supreme Court dismissed Essar's petition seeking a review of an earlier verdict to defer payment. Essar, which has already booked a Rs 4000&amp;amp;nbsp;crore loss in its books for the tax liability, hopes to service repayments from the increased cashflows of its expanded refinery, but is also in talks with several banks to raise funds for the payment, Gupta said, but declined to name the banks. &amp;quot;If the Gujarat government insists on some interest, to that extent our earnings will definitely get impacted. But going forward, we see strong cash flows and earnings, so we are not unduly worried,&amp;quot; Gupta said. Essar will be able to use heavy crude for almost 80% of its capacity and is gradually shifting to Latin American oil from Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. &amp;quot;Middle East crude slowly will get reduced in our basket. If they are not low API, if they are costlier, we will reduce. Ultimately, it's a question of optimising margins,&amp;quot; Gupta said. Essar is also reducing dependence on oil from Iran, its single largest supplier, in line with plans by other Indian refiners as international sanctions target the flow of Iran's exports. The US and its allies aim to reduce Iran's oil revenues to pressure Tehran not to build nuclear weapons. Essar had renewed a contract with Iran in January for 100,000 bpd, Gupta said, the same volume as last year. Iranian crude would account for around 25% of Essar's supplies when the expansion was completed, down from around 40 percent, he added. Industry sources have told Reuters Essar plans to cut 15% from its 100,0000 bpd contract, which runs from April 2012 for a year. Gupta declined to comment. Earlier this month, data published by a leading industry consultant showed India has vaulted to the top of the list of Iran's oil customers, overtaking China, in a first-quarter buying surge ahead of tighter sanctions against Tehran this summer. India's Iranian crude imports could fall around 25% from April, when new annual contracts take effect."

Ambuja Cements: Plans to increase its capacity with brownfield expansion at Sankrail grinding unit in the eastern region adding 0.8mtpa capacity and a Greenfield expansion project to set up 2.2mtpa clinkerization unit in Nagaur district (agreement signed with Rajastan Industrial Development and Industrial Corporation in 2010). The Rajasthan plant is expected to come on stream by 2015. The company also plans to start production of coal for the coal block allotted in the state of Maharashtra (in a JV with IST and Lafarge) by 2015. The total capex for these projects is estimated to be at Rs27bn. The funding for the project would be through internal accruals as Ambuja&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents for CY11 itself stood at Rs 29bn. Though Ambuja&rsquo;s 1QCY12 performance was boosted by lower costs helping expansion in margins, we expect margins to come under pressure in the ensuing quarters as the recent cost increases like railway freight hike (+23% effective from March 6, 2012) &amp;amp;amp; excise duty hike (+200 bps increased on March 16, 2012)) are yet to reflect completely. CIL&rsquo;s coal price hikes post its wage hike would also add further pressure on energy costs. Revenues at Rs26.3bn grew 19.3% yoy as cement volumes grew 9.6% yoy while realizations at Rs4262/t grew 8.9% yoy and 4.3% qoq. We believe that the stock&rsquo;s valuations at 8.3X EV/E &amp;amp;amp; EV/T of USD163 does not factor in these margin risks and leaves little upside from current levels. Maintain Reduce. Hindustan Zinc: During FY12 annual production capacity of lead was enhanced to 193kt (from 93ktpa, silver capacity enhanced to 500tpa (from 250ktpa), while a zinc smelter of 60ktpa (from total capacity of 879ktpa) brought under ramp down. The mining plan of their mine (largest mine namely Agucha) warrant development activities during H1FY12 at the site which could adversely affect production before it restarts at full rate during H2FY12. The lead business would ramp up steadily during FY13. We expect silver business to grow slowly clocking 300 ton in FY13 and 350 ton in FY14 (Co has however guided 350ton in FY13).  Focus currently lies on systematic greenfield exploration opportunities over 4500 sq km of area on which they have Reconnaisance Permits (RPs). It has also sought new RPs for around 18700 sq km. It is quite evident that additional refined metal capacities will be taken up only after they have access to fresh mining sources. With the strong balance sheet and cash of Rs180bn as on 31st March 2012 possibility of growth through acquisition cannot be ruled out. They have also announced dividend policy envisaging about 20% PAT as dividend payout. At the CMP of Rs 126, the stock is trading at 8.2x its FY14E EPS and 3.8x FY14E EV/ EBITDA. We value the stock at 5x FY14 EV/ EBITDA. Maintain Buy with a revised target price of Rs 147/ share. Reliance Industries (RIL): Reported its numbers above our expectations and in line with market expectations. GRMs surprised on upside with higher margins QoQ despite benchmark Singapore GRMs being lower QoQ and light-heavy crude spread worsening. Company reported GRM of &amp;amp;#36;7.6/bbl v/s &amp;amp;#36;6.8 in Q3FY12 and &amp;amp;#36;9.2/bbl Q4FY11. Higher Other Income at Rs23bn v/s Rs9bn in Q4FY11 stalled the decline of net profit to Rs42bn, a decline of 21%yoy and 5%qoq. Going ahead we remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of weak demand and/or new capacities additions. While the concerns on declining gas production in KG basin have remained, RIL stock has under performed by 12% / 20% in the last 3months/12months. Also a weak refining and petchem margin scenario has not helped the stock. Going ahead we see refining segment on a weak footing on the back of weak demand. Refining margins may gain some support from refining mothballing in US and Europe, however we suspect the sustainability of such support. As of now about 2mbpd of refining capacity in US and Europe is either shut down and looking for buyer or operating at lower capacity. (Refer our Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas update dated 18th April 2012). In case of petchem, demand remains a concern and any weakness in demand could impact any sustained recovery in margins. With the likelihood of gas production declining further, the stock is likely to remain weak and underperform going ahead. Going ahead we remain cautious on refining and petchem margins on the back of new capacities and/or weakening demand. We now factor in lower GRMs and built in flat margins from petchem for FY13E and FY14E. The stock currently trades at FY13E and FY14E PE multiple of 11.7x and 11.2x, we maintain our reco to Hold and cut our target price to Rs835 (Rs.879 earlier), says Emkay Global Financial Services research report.

GRM is the difference between the cost of crude and the price of refined products. This is what experts believe must have led to better GRMs for RIL SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com says: Market has not expected GRM to cross &amp;amp;#36; 7bbl as crude cost went up. Between January and March, the price of brent crude rose 15.6% to &amp;amp;#36;122.88 each barrel. Dealing a double blow, the rupee strengthened against the dollar by around 5%, which made crude more expensive. However,&amp;amp;nbsp; he points out that despite better-than-expected GRM, the net profit was short of the expectation, that indicates that probably the petchem has taken more hit than what it was expected. &amp;amp;nbsp;Energy expert Narendra Taneja believes: The sources of crude and also finding better markets where they were able to actually get better price for petroleum products such as the United States and also certain markets in the Middle East. Brokerages had estimated RIL&rsquo;s GRM to come in at &amp;amp;#36;6.5 per barrel, below the benchmark GRM of &amp;amp;#36;7.6 per barrel. &ldquo;RIL&rsquo;s GRM could be 30% lower than the year ago, BoA-ML report had said. &amp;amp;nbsp;RIL&rsquo;s refinery at Jamnagar is one of the most complex plants in the world and can process heavier (impurer and cheaper) crude to yield a product slate of the same quality that other refiners produce using lighter (purer and more expensive) crude. Soaring international prices of crude lead to the price differential between light and heavy crude narrowing, since demand for the latter rises as it&rsquo;s cheaper. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Reliance Industry quarterly results 1. The Reliance Industries results for the Q4FY12 have been in-line of the estimates. 2. While most of the parameters have been in-line of the estimates, there is definite positive surprise on the GRM (Gross Refining Margins). While the estimate of GRM was below US&amp;amp;#36; 7 per barrel, the company has posted GRM of US&amp;amp;#36; 7.6 per barrel. That&rsquo;s definitely positive during this quarter. 3. One more interesting aspect of the financials is the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; segment. The relevance of &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; has been substantially increasing with each passing quarter. The company has huge cash pile of about Rs 70,252 Crores. This is resulting into huge &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; on the ample cash balances on the balance sheet of about Rs 2,295 Crores. 4. Just to put the things in perspective regarding the growing significance of &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; in the performance of Reliance, would like to mention a quick statistic. Profit Before Tax of the company is about Rs 5,431 Crores and &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; is about Rs 2,295 Crore. That means, about 42% of Profit Before Tax is coming from the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot;. I can't think of any other company of the size of Reliance who gets such a massive proportion of Profit from &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot;. 5. To put in other words, the &amp;quot;core business&amp;quot; of the company is contributing just about 58% of the Profit Before Tax and the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; is contributing about 42% of the Profit Before Tax. 6. To summarize, Reliance is making more and more money out of money, less and less money out of oil. 7. Probably, it is high time that the company has to clearly pronounce the cash deployment plan regarding how are they going to use Rs 70,252 Crores. Else, this factor may remain to be huge overhang on the performance of the stock.

RIL, after ruling out any amicable settlement on the dispute, has knocked the doors of the Supreme Court.  Find out what eventually led the energy giant to approach the apex court In January 2011, RIL had said it will hit peak output of 80 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) from 60 mmscmd from its eastern offshore KG-DG fields in FY2012-13. But in February 2011, it issued a statement saying that&amp;amp;nbsp;the output from KG D6 has slipped due to technical problems to about 52 mmscmd. In the same month, RIL roped in British Energy giant BP which picked up 30% stake in 23 of RIL&rsquo;s oil blocks including the big gas producer D6 in the KG basin. While announcing this, RIL had said, it will use BP's technical expertise to boost output at DG block. But, even after the tie-up, output declined almost 20% month-on-month and remained pretty much stagnant in the following months. RIL expressed inability to firm up appropriate drilling locations due to geological complexities at the basin. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGK) blamed RIL for drilling fewer wells as against the 31 approved under&amp;amp;nbsp;the field development plan.&amp;amp;nbsp;Despite RIL's repeated argument that technical glitches were leading to a decline in their&amp;amp;nbsp;output, the DGH remained unfazed. June 2011 onwards, the blame game between the government and&amp;amp;nbsp; RIL intensified&amp;amp;nbsp;wherein RIL kept pointing out at excessive water/sand ingress as reasons for declining output, and the government maintained that RIL neither drilled the remaining nine oil producing wells nor took any alternative action such as revisions of the field development plan as per the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract. The PSC mentions that RIL would start sharing profits after it had recovered 100% of its drilling costs. But peeved at the way RIL was functioning, the ministry sratred moving toward restricting the 100% cost-recovery clause. Instead, it&amp;amp;nbsp;wanted to modify the existing clause and share profits in proportion to gas output from the KG-D6 fields.  But RIL, according to reports,&amp;amp;nbsp;communicated to the oil ministry that as per the PSC it should be allowed to recover 100% of its exploration and production costs and the government should not link cost-recovery to output. RIL argued that it had envisaged a gas output of 80 mmcmd by 2012 from an investment of &amp;amp;#36;8.8 billion. However, it could invest only &amp;amp;#36;5.8 billion so far and output is only about half of the desired target. To protect its interest, RIL sent an arbitration notice to the oil ministry, which the latter ignored citing it as non-event."

R K Global estimates on Reliance Industries for Q4FY12: Revenue to grow 2.8% Y-o-Y We estimate RIL to post net revenue of `747059mn during Q4FY12, reporting 2.8% Y-o-Y growth. The subdued growth in revenue is attributed to production decline in its refinery segment primarily on account of 3 week maintenance shutdown of one crude distillation unit at its SEZ refinery this quarter. We expect RIL&rsquo;s crude throughput to be at 15.3MMT this quarter as against 16.7MMT in Q4FY11. We see petchem volumes to be lower this quarter at 4.8MMT as against 5.2MMT. Subdued refinery and petchem margins to impact profitability Decline in Arab L-H differentials and weakness in distillate cracks will continue to put pressure on the refining margins in Asia-Pac region. We expect RIL&rsquo;s refinery margin to be at USD 7.6/bbl for this quarter. While in petchem segment, margin pressure was felt in PE and PP while PVC margins saw some improvement. We expect RIL&rsquo;s Operating Profit and Net Profit to decline 28.9% Y-o-Y and 32.0% Y-o-Y to Rs 76555mn and Rs 36571mn respectively.

We expect RIL to report net profit of INR40.9b (v/s INR53.8b in 4QFY11 and INR44.4b in 3QFY12).

Crude oil saw a signficant increase during the quarter, with Brent oil prices averaging at US&amp;amp;#36;118.5/bbl. Prices were high on account of geopolitical tension building between Iran and Western countries. GRMs witnessed marginal contraction on account of weakness in the distillates cracks. In the Petchem segment, global cracker margins improved, while the pressure was felt in PE and PP margins. The PVC margins witnessed an improvement.  Crude oil witnessed significant increase during the quarter, with Brent oil prices increasing to an average of US&amp;amp;#36;118.5/bbl, with prices ranging between US&amp;amp;#36;108- 126/bbl. The main drivers of the oil prices were supply-led concerns, led by Iran-EU tension over oil sanction and Sudan-South Sudan dispute over transit fees. EU has banned Iranian crude imports at the end of January 2012 and gave six months grace period for the EU members to end oil contract by July 1. In response, Iran warned to close the Strait of Hormuz, the main crude shipping lanes and prepared to stop oil exports to the EU immediately. The action has tightened crude oil market as the EU usually imports crude from Iran at around 400-500 thousand barrels per day. Light-heavy differentials declined on a QoQ basis, with AH-AL spread averaging at US&amp;amp;#36;3.3/bbl as against US&amp;amp;#36;3.9/bbl. The spreads between Dubai Fateh-AH declined to US&amp;amp;#36;(0.7)/bbl as against US&amp;amp;#36;0.5/bbl in the previous quarter. The same is likely to adversely impact the performance of RIL as the premium over the Singapore GRMS is likely to further decline in the current quarter as RIL procures heavy grade of the crude with API similar to Arab Heavy crude.

RIL-BP propose to drill one gas production well on the MA oilfield in the eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block besides intervention jobs in at least two of the existing six wells on the fields, sources privy to the development said. MA is the only oil find made by RIL in the 7,645 square kilometre KG-D6 block. The field produces about 11,200 barrels a day of along and associated gas of 6.45 million cubic meters per day. MA field makes up for about one-fifth of the 34.09 mmcmd of current gas output from KG-D6 block. Sources said six wells had been drilled on MA field, of which one had to be closed because of water loading and sand ingress. RIL-BP plan to do workover (intervention activity involving invasive techniques to raise output) on the closed well and at least one more well facing similar problems. This together with a seventh well, which would only produce gas unlike the current five wells that produce both oil and gas, would help the field raise output to 8 mmcmd. MA field had begun oil production in September 2008 and gas in April 2009 and in 2010 had averaged 8 mmcmd of gas output. Sources said the revised FDP for MA field was submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) in February and RIL-BP have made technical presentation.  Also, RIL-BP are working on an integrated and capital efficient plan for block development, involving production from all the 18 gas discoveries in KG-D6. They projected first gas from R-Series, the third largest gas find in KG-D6 block, by 2015 and production from satellite fields by 2016 subject to timely regulatory approvals. RIL began production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields, the largest among the 18 gas and one oil find, in April 2009 but output has fallen from a peak of 54 million cubic meters per day in March 2010 to 27.64 mmcmd this month. Together with 6.45 mmcmd of gas production from D-26 or MA oil field in the same area, block output is 34.09 mmcmd. The plan would help in cost savings of over USD 1 billion due to integration and optimisation. In addition, un-incurred phase-II cost of D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 field development plan (USD 3.1 billion out of total cost of USD 8.8 billion) would not be required to be spent, they said. Sources said RIL-BP plan to connect R-Series and four satellite fields, for which a USD 1.529 billion field development plan was approved by the government in January, to the existing infrastructure used to produce gas from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and MA. Also, other satellite fields would be hooked up to these. R-series and four satellite fields alone have potential to add 30 mmscmd of output.&amp;amp;nbsp;"

The Canadian firm in a statement said it expects a drop in reserves at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3), the largest of the 18 gas finds in KG-D6 block. &amp;quot;Production performance at the D1/D3 fields within the D6 block indicates the need for a revision to the current geological model. While analysis continues, Niko anticipates a drop in its reserves for the D1/D3 fields,&amp;quot; the company said without giving details. D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 had previously been stated to hold about 11 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. Niko, which holds 10% stake in the RIL-operated KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block off the Andhra coast, had last month stated that gas production in the October-December quarter from the D6 block averaged 40.49 million cubic meters per day, as compared to 55.21 mmcmd in the year-ago period. D6 gas production in December averaged approximately 137 mmcfd (38.79 mmcmd for the entire block), Niko had said. &amp;quot;Declines are expected to continue until workovers are completed and/or additional wells are tied in,&amp;quot; it had added. The current output is less than half of the peak 80 mmcmd that RIL had projected as fewer wells were drilled than planned and seven wells ceased to produce due to the entry of sand or water. RIL has so far drilled 22 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 but only 18 were put on production. Of these, six have ceased due to water/sand ingress. The company is to do workovers or maintenance of these well, which may raise the output, Niko said. MA oilfield in the same block had seen one out of the five wells cease due to the same reasons. The Canadian firm today said plans were approved for the development of the first four satellite discoveries around the currently producing D1&amp;amp;amp;D3. Besides sizeable production would come when R-Series fields in the block are developed. &amp;quot;On the positive side, as development plans are approved, Niko contemplates additional reserves from the R complex, satellite fields and full block development,&amp;quot; Niko said.&amp;amp;nbsp; These fields can add up to 30 mmcmd to the output. RIL holds 60% interest in the 7,645-sq-km D6 block after farming-out 30% stake in BP Plc of UK.

The pre-Budget policy document said gas production from KG-D6 fields during April-December 2011-12 was about 12.36 billion cubic meters against the production of 15.82 BCM during the same period in 2010-11. &amp;quot;The gas production has reportedly decreased due to drop in pressure in the wells and increased water ingress leading to lower output of gas per well,&amp;quot; it said. Drop in KG-D6 production pulled down nation's gas output during first nine months of the current fiscal to 36.19 BCM as compared to 39.68 BCM during the same period last year. &amp;quot;The projected production for natural gas, including coal bed methane (CBM) for 2011-12 is 51.67 (BCM), which is 1.05% lower than the actual production of 52.22 BCM in 2010-11,&amp;quot; it said. During the current fiscal, production of crude oil is estimated at 38.19 million tonnes, which is about 1.33% higher than the 37.70 million tonnes produced during 2010-11. Domestic crude oil production during April-December was 28.70 million tonnes showing a growth of 1.9% over the same period of the previous year. Oil production from Cairn India's prolific Rajasthan block was 4.80 million tonnes in nine months of current fiscal against total production of 5.148 million tons during full 2010-11 fiscal. The Survey said a total of USD 15.88 billion investment has been made in 235 blocks awarded in eight auction rounds under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) since 1999. &amp;quot;Under NELP 103 oil and gas discoveries have been made by private/joint venture (JV) companies in 34 blocks and more than 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent hydrocarbon reserves have been added,&amp;quot; it said. India has the fourth largest proven coal reserves in the world and holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. Under the CBM policy, 33 exploration blocks, the Survey said, adding 8.92 Trillion cubic feet output of prognosticated resources of about 92 Tcf, have sofar been established. &amp;quot;Commercial production of CBM in India has now become a reality with current CBM gas production of about 0.23 million cubic metre per day,&amp;quot; it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The document said shale gas can emerge as an important new source of energy in the country.

The contract for eastern offshore KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block provides for all actual expenditure incurred to be first recovered from sale of oil/gas before profits are split between the contractor and the government. Reddy said RIL has claimed USD 9.47 billion in cost of developing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields, MA oilfield and exploration in the 7,645 sq km block in Bay of Bengal. Of this, it has recovered USD 5.26 billion even though the Management Committee, which overseas operations of the block, has approved only USD 3.99 billion cost recovery up to 2007-08 fiscal. &amp;quot;While contractor (RIL) has claimed an expenditure of USD 9.47 billion and cost recovered USD 5.26 billion up to 2010-11, the MC has approved only USD 3.99 billion up to financial year 2007-08,&amp;quot; he said in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha. Of the USD 9.47 billion, RIL and its partners had incurred USD 5.7 billion in developing D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields and another USD 1.73 billion in bringing MA oilfield into production. &amp;quot;The audited accounts are placed before MC for adopting the same as provided under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). MC has approved the said audited accounts upto the year 2007-08,&amp;quot; he added without details of accounts of subsequent years. The auditors appointed by the Government had audited accounts of KG-D6 block up to 2006-07. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) carried out a special audit of the block for 2006-07 and 2007-08 and has agreed to conduct regular audit for the block for 2008-09. Reddy said while CAG in report had observed that large procurement contracts were given on single bid basis, the top auditor &amp;quot;has not quantified any loss of revenue to the Government.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The report of the CAG is under consideration of Public Accounts Committee (PAC),&amp;quot; he added.&amp;amp;nbsp; Natural gas production at KG-D6 has fallen to about 35-36 million standard cubic meters per day from 61.5 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. While RIL says output has fallen because of fall in reservior pressure and ingress of water and sand in wells, the oil ministry and its technical arm Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) believes it is due to the company drilling less number of wells.  &amp;quot;DGH under this ministry has reported that the reasons for lower gas production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in the block KG-DWN-98/3 may be attributed to drilling of less number of development wells (producers) as compared to that envisaged in the MC approved Addendum to Initial Development Plan,&amp;quot; Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singhsaid in reply to a separate question.  In addition, six out of 18 producing wells in D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields have ceased to produce gas due to water loading/sand ingress, he said. In case of MA field in the same block, one oil/gas producing well out of six oil/gas producing wells has also ceased due to water loading in the well, he said.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;As per approved AIDP, contractor is required to drill, complete and put on production total 22 wells by March 2011 and 31 wells by March 2012. &amp;quot;The contractor has, however, drilled total 22 wells so far, out of which 18 wells were put on production. Balance four wells are to be completed or connected for production,&amp;quot; he added. RIL, he said, has been asked to &amp;quot;increase the gas production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields by adopting appropriate measures such as well drilling, well intervention etc.&amp;quot; "

RIL currently buys 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) or 4 million tonnes a year crude from Rajasthan, that it processes at its old 33 million tonnes a year domestic tariff area (DTA) refinery on the West Coast. It has now applied to the government to buy another 30,000 bpd of Cairn crude for turning it into fuel at its 29 million tonnes SEZ (Special Economic Zone) refinery adjacent to the old unit. Official sources said the company's request would be considered by the Board of Approval, headed by Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar, next week. Any sale to a SEZ or only-for-exports unit is considered outward shipment or exports out of India. The current policy does not allow export of domestically produced crude oil. RIL's request comes just when Cairn is beginning to ramp up production from Rajasthan fields. Cairn currently produces 125,000 barrels per day from Mangala oilfield, the largest find in the Rajasthan block. Another 20,000 bpd is produced from Bhagyam fields. Mangala can go up to 150,000 bpd or 7.5 million tonnes a year anytime now while Bhagyam has an approved peak of 40,000 bpd and can go up to 60,000 bpd with more investments. Sources said Cairn currently sells 15,000-20,000 bpd to state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and another 30,000-40,000 bpd to Essar Oil. RIL's refinery complex at Jamnagar, consisting of the old DTA refinery and an SEZ unit, are connected by a heated pipeline to the Mangala field in Rajasthan. Rajasthan crude is very heavy with API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity between 25-30. Also, waxiness of the crude turns it into solid at room temperature. Transportation of the Rajasthan crude therefore, requires special heating arrangements in the pipeline to keep the crudein a liquid form. Most Indian domestic refineries lack the configuration to process Rajasthan crude due to its quality. Others face logistical issues. Sources said RIL's SEZ refinery, which is designed to process far heavier crudes, is unable to use Rajasthan crude as the same has been classified as a restricted item under the current Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) provisions. The unit has, therefore, sought approval of the BoA for the importing crude oil from Cairn India. "

RIL had on January 6 written to the Oil Ministry and the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) seeking a gas price revision, saying the current USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit rate for KG-D6 gas was &amp;quot;sub-market&amp;quot; price compared with three times higher price being paid for imported gas (LNG). The PMO subsequently asked the oil ministry to legally examine if the government can allow RIL to increase the price. The government had in 2007 fixed USD 4.20 per mmBtu as the price of gas produced from KG-D6 fields for first five years of production. KG-D6 fields started production in 2009. But the Oil Ministry's letter on October 10, 2007, informing RIL of the pricing decision did not stop at this and went on to state that if the company was to realise a price higher than USD 4.20 per mmBtu, then that rate would be used for determining government's take from KG-D6 block. Sources said it is perplexing why this clause was inserted if the gas price was to be USD 4.2 per mmBtu for five years as the Oil Ministry is insisting now. RIL had originally proposed a rate of over USD 4.3 per mmBtu for first three years of production which was later tweeked by an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) to USD 4.2 per mmBtu for five years. &amp;quot;If the actual price at which any supplies made to any consumer happens to be higher than the one arrived at by (the formula approved by the EGoM), then the higher price shall be taken for purposes of the Government take for that quantity,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote to RIL on October 10, 2007. This clause in the oil ministry letter may be the reason behind RIL's January 6 letter seeking revision of &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sub-market&amp;quot; price for KG-D6. Sources said the ministry is not inclined to accept RIL request on the grounds that RIL had accepted to keep price stable at USD 4.2 per mmBtu for five years. It is also relying on the Supreme Court's May 7, 2010 judgement in the gas row between RIL and Anil Ambani's RNRL that stated that government alone has the right to fix the selling price of gas from all fields including KG-D6. When the nation can pay USD 12-14 per mmBtu price to overseas producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the domestic gas producers too deserve an equivalent price. While high imported LNG price gives no incentive to the government, a higher domestic price would fetch it higher revenues in form of royalty, taxes and profit petroleum."

The D6 gas output has been declining for more than a year, resulting in a sharp fall in India's gas output and forcing the country to resort to increased imports of expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet demands of its expanding economy. Gas output, currently around 37-38 million standard cubic meters a day (mscmd), may average 27.60 mscmd in the fiscal year starting April, about 66% lower than initially estimated, a government source said earlier this month. &amp;quot;It will maximise use of the entire existing infrastructure to produce the balance of the discoveries and minimize new infrastructure needed,&amp;quot; BP India head Sashi Mukundan told reporters. A single development plan for the entire KG D6 block, compared to current norm of field-wise plans, will bring more certainty and comfort to customers, he said. BP acquired stake in 23 oil and gas blocks in India, some in the KG block, from Reliance Industries in a USD 7.2 billion deal last year. The two companies aim to boost production to a sustainable level from both the existing fields and the next wave of developments -- D6 satellites &amp;amp;amp; R Series and the NEC-25. Reliance, India's biggest company by market value, has been under pressure from the government and investors because of the falling gas output, and its market value tumbled 35% in 2011, underperforming the main Mumbai market. Earlier, Mukundan said the British oil and gas major wanted a predictable pricing regime for natural gas in India, as this is vital for developing future projects in the country. &amp;quot;Clarity on gas pricing is vital for the development of the 'next wave' of projects, which will add production beyond 2015 but for which investment decisions need to be made now,&amp;quot; he said at an event. Gas prices in India are set between USD 4 to USD 6 per million British thermal units (MBTU) but are far below double-digit prices globally, in part to be competitive with cheap local coal. Reliance shares closed down 4.7% at Rs 781.45&amp;amp;nbsp;in a Mumbai market that fell 2.7%."

In this year it fell to 37 mmcmd. In this regard, we are going to issue notice (to Reliance),&amp;quot; Reddy told reports during his maiden visit to KG-Basin. The Oil Ministry and its technical arm - the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) - blame the fall in output from KG-D6 fields to 34.5 million cubic meters per day instead of 70.39 mmcmd planned for now, and 80 mmcmd by April, due to RIL drilling fewer wells than it had committed. The ministry is consulting with legal experts on sending the notice to RIL and will go through the normal legal process, Reddy had said last week. DGH wants USD 1.235 billion, out of the USD 5.7 billion expenditure already made in KG-D6, to be disallowed as RIL has drilled and completed only 18 wells as against the agreed upon 31 wells in the block, resulting in lower gas output. Anticipating such a move, RIL had on November 24 slapped an arbitration notice saying the Production Sharing Contract allows 100 per cent of the expenses to be recovered and has no provision to restrict cost recovery in proportion to output. RIL says it has not drilled the committed number of wells as the reservoir has not behaved as predicted and output dipped due to a fall in pressure and water and sand ingress in wells."

RIL, in a status report filed with the Oil Ministry, stated that natural gas production from the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields and the MA oilfield in Block KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6, in the Krishna-Godavari Basin of the Bay of Bengal, was 35.77 mmscmd in the week ended February 5. Sources said the output dipped to 34.5 mmscmd in the subsequent week. The output during January 30 to February 5 comprised of 29.22 mmscmd from the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields and 6.55 mmscmd from the MA oilfield. The KG-D6 production is lower than 61.5 mmscmd rate achieved in March, 2010, before a drop in pressure in the wells and increased water and sand ingress pulled down per-well gas output. The report said of the 18 wells drilled, completed and put on production in the D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, six wells -- A2, A6, A10, B1, B2 and B13, were kept closed due to high water cut/sanding issues. Sources said till last month 13 wells were producing and a sixth well -- A6 -- was shut recently. In its projections for next two fiscal, RIL has stated that the KG-D6 output will fall further to 27.60 mmscmd in 2012-13 and to 22.60 mmscmd in 2013-14. This will be the lowest production level since RIL began production from KG-D6 block in April 2009. Sources said RIL in its projections has stated that output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 in 2012-13 would be 20.20 mmscmd and another 7.40 mmscmd will come from MA oilfield. In the subsequent year, production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 would further drop to 14 mmscmd, while MA oilfield is expected to produce 8.60 mmscmd. The output from KG-D6 is short of the 70.39 mmscmd (61.88 mmscmd from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 and 8.5 mmscmd from MA field) level envisaged by now as per the field development plan approved in 2006. Production was to touch 80 mmscmd by April, 2012 after all the 31 wells envisaged in the development plan are drilled and brought to production. RIL has so far drilled 22 wells on Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas finds in the KG-D6 block that have been brought to production, but only 18 were put-on production. Of these 18, six have ceased due to water/sand ingress. MA oilfield in the same block had seen one out of the five wells cease due to the same reasons. RIL is the operator of the 7,645-sq-km D6 block with 60 per cent stake while London-based BP plc has 30 per cent interest. The remaining is with Niko Resources of Canada. According to RIL status report, the MA oilfield, where one of the five oil wells had been shut due to water loading, produced about 11,882 barrels of crude oil per day in the week ending February 5. In addition, 1,578 barrels of condensate are produced from the field every day. The report said 14.66 mmscmd of the gas output was sold to fertiliser plants and 18.02 mmscmd to power plants. The remaining 3.09 mmscmd was consumed by other sectors, including compressors and internal use of the East-West pipeline that transports gas from the East Coast to consumption centres in the West. Niko had last week warned that KG-D6 fields may see a further decline in output until new wells are brought to production. The Canadian firm said its share of D6 gas production in December averaged approximately 137 million cubic feet per day mmcfd (38.79 mmscmd for the entire block). &amp;quot;Declines are expected to continue until work overs are completed and/or additional wells are tied in,&amp;quot; it said, adding that RIL was to do workovers or maintenance of the six closed wells which may raise the output."

The sixth well was shut last week, the source with direct knowledge of the development, said. Reliance, the operator of the D6 block, had earlier shut five of 18 producing wells at D1 and D3 gas fields until December. Declining gas output from the D6 block has impacted expansion plans of many power companies, and spurred demand for costly liquefied natural gas imports. Gas output from D6 may average 22.6 million standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) in the fiscal year starting April 2013 from the current 37-38 mmscmd, a government source said on Thursday. Shares of Reliance closed 2.9% lower in a week Mumbai market. The gas output may fall to 27.60 mmscmd in 2012/13, about 66% lower than initial estimate. Reliance has informed the upstream regulator, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), that output from D1 and D3 gas fields may fall to 14 mmscmd and that from MA field would be 8.60 mmscmd in the year beginning April 2013, the source said. Reliance last year brought in the offshore expertise of BP , which paid USD 7.2 billion to invest in 23 oil and gas blocks with the Indian firm, to help it arrest the decline. Reliance and BP are jointly studying the reservoir profile of D1 and D3 fields. &amp;quot;The study should be completed by July-August. The output cannot be predicted now,&amp;quot; said the first source. Currently, the only hope to produce more gas is linked to the development of four satellite fields and R-1 gas discovery at the block. The satellite fields are estimated to hold about 0.6 trillion cubic feet (TCF) gas reserves. Reliance, which earlier this year got approval to develop the four satellite fields, plans to produce gas from these facilities around 2015. &amp;quot;Initial production will be less but in 2-3 years it will touch a peak rate of 10 mmscmd. The plateau production will last for 6 year,&amp;quot; the source said. Reliance's efforts to raise output of D6 block are restricted due to narrow window of fair weather in the east coast. The DGH recently approved Reliance's R-1 gas discovery as commercially viable. Reliance has one year to submit field development plans of the discovery estimated to hold 1.6 TCF gas reserves. Canadian oil and gas producer Niko Resources Ltd, which holds 10% in the Reliance-operated D6 block and posted a quarterly loss due to the reduced production in the block, earlier this month warned that output decline could continue at the site."

The Oil Ministry had on October 10, 2007, written to RIL fixing USD 4.20 per million British thermal unit as the price of gas from KG-D6 fields for first five years of production, informed sources said. The letter however did not stop at this and went on to state that if RIL was to realise a price higher than USD 4.20 per mmBtu, that rate would be used for determining government's take from KG-D6 block. &amp;quot;If the actual price at which any supplies made to any consumer happens to be higher than the one arrived at by (the formula approved by the Empowered Group of Ministers), then the higher price shall be taken for purposes of the Government take for that quantity,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote to RIL on October 10, 2007. It is perplexing why this clause was inserted if the gas price was to be USD 4.2 per mmBtu for five years as the Oil Ministry is insisting now. Sources said the ministry's has prepared a draft reply rejecting RIL's demand for revision in KG-D6 price citing a letter the company wrote on October 24, 2007 accepting the terms set out in the government's October 10, 2007 letter. But the ministry's October 10, 2007 letter alluding to RIL realising a price higher than the one fixed by the EGoM headed by the then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, is equivocal. This may be the reason behind RIL's January 6 letter to the ministry seeking revision of &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sub-market&amp;quot; price for KG-D6, where gas production started in April 2009. It cited liquefied natural gas (LNG) being imported by public sector firms at triple the KG-D6 price to seek a revision. Sources said the ministry's draft rejecting reopening of price before 2014, also relies on the Supreme Court's May 7, 2010 judgement in the gas row between RIL and Anil Ambani's RNRL that stated that government alone has the right to fix the selling price of gas from all fields including KG-D6. RIL, they said, has never questioned the right of the government to approve the gas price and it does not propose to sell fuel without government approval. It has approached the ministry with a request for review of the gas price and would sell the fuel at higher rates only after its nod. Stating that the current price of gas was no longer viable, the company had in the January 6 given the government 90 days to reach an &amp;quot;amicable settlement&amp;quot; over gas pricing. Under the dispute resolution process detailed in the Production Sharing Contract, parties are required to try for reconciliation of differences for three months before heading for arbitration. RIL may be thinking of arbitration on the issue."

We are ready and willing to provide all three.&amp;quot; A government panel on Tuesday approved allowing India's cash-starved airlines to import their own jet fuel, a move that could help them cut fuel costs -- which account for about half of their operation costs -- by up to 20 percent. The decision, which needs cabinet approval, will allow airlines to avoid various federal and state taxes levied by state-run oil firms, but will require carriers to set up extensive infrastructure to store and transport the fuel. Indian airlines are likely to lose up to USD 3 billion in the fiscal year ending March, according to the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, as carriers struggle due to high fuel costs, cutthroat competition and a slowdown in the economy. &amp;amp;nbsp;"

But RIL says raising the price to&amp;amp;nbsp;USD 6 per unit is a viable option as they have run into cost overruns on the project. It may be recalled that RIL had written to the ministry late last year that it is the only gas company which is sharing profits with the government on selling gas from KG-D6 at USD 4.20 per unit. The energy giant had also contended that it has not yet recovered cost on this project and hence it needs to hike the price of the gas It also pointed out in a communication with the ministry that there are public run companies like ONGC who do not split any profits with the government and hence they should be treated at par with private companies like theirs. Hence, to resolve this cost recovery issue so as not to hinder future investments in this block, the company has begun arbitration proceedings against the government. Under the KG-D6 production sharing contract (PSC) signed between RIL and the government, RIL was allowed to recover the complete expenditure that it had incurred to develop the fields before it started splitting its profits with the government.  However, RIL said that&amp;amp;nbsp; production from the field is receding and it need to cover up its cost. So far, RIL has incurred a capex of around &amp;amp;#36;5.8 billion, of which it has recovered up to &amp;amp;#36;5.2 billion for a targeted production of 60 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of gas, said the head of research of a leading international brokerage.

RIL, in an advertisement issued in national and regional dailies, asked consumers to quote a figure in US dollars per million British thermal units that can be added to the price at which Petronet LNG ships gas in its liquid state (liquefied natural gas or LNG) from Qatar under a long-term contract. While its eastern offshore KG-D6 gas price is fixed at USD 4.205 per mmBtu for the five years ending March 31, 2014, RIL had on September 16 demanded that coal bed methane (CBM) it plans to produce from its Sohagpur block in Madhya Pradesh should be priced by the same formula as Petronet's Qatar LNG deal. It had sought 12.67 per cent of the average price of crude oil imported into Japan (called Japan Crude Cocktail, or JCC) plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu. Petronet pays RasGas of Qatar a price of 12.67 per cent of JCC, besides incurring a USD 0.26 per mmBtu cost on transporting the gas in ships. At a USD 100 per barrel JCC average, CBM -- according to RIL's September formula -- would cost USD 12.67 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, totalling USD 12.93 per mmBtu.&amp;amp;nbsp;Great Eastern Energy Corp (GEECL) is selling CBM produced from its Raniganj block in West Bengal at USD 6.79 per mmBtu, while domestically produced natural gas is priced at USD 4.2 to USD 5.73 per mmBtu. Essar Oil has proposed a price of USD 4.20 per mmBtu for its CBM. RIL, in today's advertisement, has retained the pricing formula and asked users to quote a positive or negative number that can be added to this pricing formula. The company is also demanding a marketing margin of USD 0.15 per mmBtu from CBM users, even though its USD 0.135 per mmBtu marketing margin charged on KG-D6 gas has been sent to oil regulator PNGRB for review. Sources said the Oil Ministry was reluctant to approve the price sought by RIL in September last year as nowhere in the world is domestic gas priced at LNG rates. Moreover, LNG costs more than domestic gas because of the huge investment that goes into putting up a liquefaction plant that turns natural gas into a liquid state by cooling it at sub-zero temperatures so that it can be shipped. The ministry scoffed at the price sought by RIL as RasGas supplies gas rich in ethane (C2) and propane (C3), which are useful in the manufacture of LPG and petrochemicals. On the other hand, CBM is just methane (C1) with no properties to make LPG/chemicals. RIL, in today's advertisement, said it will produce a peak output of 3.5 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the Sohagpur blocks by the second half of 2014."

The shares were quoted at Rs 781.80, higher by 1.40 per cent, on the BSE. Analysts said share buyback could be aimed at helping the stock regain its lost glory, given their sharp plunge of 35 per cent last year, against a fall of about 24 per cent in the market benchmark Sensex. Shares of the company had tumbled by 3 per cent on Monday after the company reported its first drop in quarterly profit in more than two years due to falling refining margins. Analysts had also attributed to the fall in share price to size of the buyback, which represented 3.7 per cent of the company's equity capital. RIL had in December, 2004, offered to buyback 10 per cent of its equity at Rs 570 per share. "

I. On Quarterly Results 1. The Reliance Industry results for the Q3 FY 12 have been below estimates, in terms of several operational metrics. 2. It seems that the company had challenging quarter in terms of GRM (Gross Refining Margins), Gas Output, PetChem margins, etc. 3. However, the positive surprise came from the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; segment, as the company was surely benefitted by the treasury income on the ample cash balances on the balance sheet of Rs 74,539 Crores. The &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; has increaed from Rs 741 Crores (in Dec 2010 quarter) to Rs 1717 Crores (in Dec 2011 quarter), showing a jump of 131.7%. 4. Hence, it can be said that, whatever profitability squeeze that company was facing on the operational front, is being compensated to some extent by the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot;. 5. Just to put the things in perspective regarding the growing significance of &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; in the performance of Reliance, would like to mention a quick statistic. The &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; in the current quarter constitutes 30% of the Profit Before Tax. That is quite a significant percentage for the size of the P&amp;amp;amp;L of Reliance. 6. To put in other words, the &amp;quot;operational business&amp;quot; of the company is contributing about 70% of the Profit Before Tax and the &amp;quot;Other Income&amp;quot; is contributing about 30% of the Profit Before Tax. 7. Further, if one observes the segmental reporting, the share of three core operational business in profit before tax is as follows: Petro Chemicals (Rs 2,157 Crores), Refining (Rs 1,685 Crores) and Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas (Rs 1,294 Crores). Whereas the Other Income is at Rs 1,717 Crores. Meaning thereby, the Other Income is contributing more than the core business segments of Refining, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas. 8. To summarize, Reliance is making more and more money out of money, less and less money out of oil. II. On the Buyback 1. The details of buyback announcement by Reliance in terms of the Buyback size (at Rs 10,440 Crores) and Buyback price (at Rs 870 per share) are in line with our estimates. 2. The modus operandi the company has choosen for buyback is &amp;quot;Open Market Purchase&amp;quot;. 3. Hence, the company will buy the shares from the open market, at the market prices. Meaning thereby, the maximum buyback price of Rs 870 per share is only &amp;quot;maximum buyback price&amp;quot; and not necessarily &amp;quot;actual buyback price&amp;quot;. 4. However, this buyback will surely provide the sentimental boost that the company is ready to buy the shares if the share price of the company comes down sharply. 5. As far as the stock price performance is concerned, it seems that the challenging impact of results may overshadow the positive impact of the buyback.

A Reliance Industries spokesman, told Reuters, that the company was in talks with various operators for partnerships and content deals. He declined to provide further details, including the names of the firms Reliance was in talks with and the nature of discussions, citing confidential clauses. The operators could not be immediately contacted by Reuters for comments. Unlisted Infotel Broadband Services Ltd. is Reliance's vehicle for its telecom space foray. Earlier in January, Reliance said it would invest in media group TV18's two main companies, marking a major foray into the media sector by the energy-focused conglomerate and giving a boost to its plans to launch 4G services. There are more than 6,000 cable operators in the country, Business Standard said in its report. In 2010, Reliance Industries, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani had agreed to buy Infotel Broadband, making his return to telecom after the business was handed over to younger sibling Anil following a family spilt. Reliance Industries had paid about 48 billion rupees for fresh equity in Infotel to get a 95 percent stake."

In a letter to RIL executive director P. M. S. Prasad, on Thursday, the Ministry wrote that the question of the quantum of marketing margin applicable on sale of gas by any marketer has since been considered in the Ministry and a decision has been taken to refer the matter to the PNGRB.  Earlier the petroleum ministry, which had long held that the marketing margin was a bilateral issue between the buyer and seller of gas, referred it to the PNGRB after user industries like fertilisers sought a clarification on the legality of the levy. The ministry's technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), too, is of the opinion that RIL should share a part of these earnings with the government. It wants the marketing margin to be added to the gas sales price of &amp;amp;#36;4.20 per mmBtu and profit-sharing between the contractor and the government to happen at the combined rate of &amp;amp;#36;4.335 per mmBtu. At present, RIL and the government split profits at the gas sales price of &amp;amp;#36;4.20 per mmBtu after deducting the project cost. However, according to sources, in a letter written to the ministry on December 20, RIL has said that even gas utility GAIL India charges up to &amp;amp;#36;0.18 per mmBtu as a marketing margin on gas it transports and none of it is shared with the government. RIL, while defending its decision to impose a marketing margin over-and-above the government-approved sale price for KG-D6 gas has said that the levy was to cover for the risk and cost associated with marketing of gas. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company has also contested DGH's view, saying the marketing margin was a cost levied beyond the gas delivery flange and as such, was not regulated by the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The PSC provides for fixation of the gas price at the delivery point-- the point at which an upstream operator transfers custody of gas to a marketing and transportation agency. That point for the eastern offshore KG-D6 gas is Kakinada, in Andhra Pradesh, and the government had in 2007 approved a gas price of &amp;amp;#36;4.205 per mmBtu at the delivery point."

The bank has cut its price target for the company to Rs 650 from Rs 921. &amp;quot;We highlight that two of three Reliance's core divisions -- refining and petrochemicals -- face near-term headwinds,&amp;quot; it said in a note. Here are factors that prompted Morgan Stanley to downgrade RIL Weak outlook for GRMs (gross refining margins) and petrochemical netbacks&amp;amp;nbsp; We believe GRMs peaked in 2011 given shutdowns from Japan and a slowdown in additions from China. We reckon the reverse will happen in 2012, with Japan production expected to ramp back up by 2H12, and China and India setting up new capacities. We remain bearish on petrochemicals in the near term as the group will be driven by demand slippage due to global slowdown. RIL has high sensitivity to both the GRMsand petrochemicals. Exploration and Production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) volumes continue to slideFrom a peak of 80 mmscmd (touched briefly for facilities testing purpose) in Dec-09,&amp;amp;nbsp; volume from KG-D6 has slipped to ~40 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day)&amp;amp;nbsp;currently. Although we view this as the bottom for volume slippage, the sale of a 30% stake to BP should lead to a lower contribution from E&amp;amp;amp;P in F2013 as compared to F2012. Earnings growth for the company is tapering off Our prior overweight call on RIL hinged on organic growth at the company across its energy space. We now see short- and medium-term headwinds in all the businesses, however, and have cut our F2012-14e EPS by 9%, 13%, and 19%, respectively. Absolute stock price level seems attractive, but is notRIL is trading at a P/E of 11.5x on our F2013 estimates, implying a ~25% discount to its historical average. However, relative to the market the stock is trading broadly in line with its historical average. In the past, RIL has shown strong earnings growth compared to the current situation of virtually no growth next year.  Cash flow is greater than capexAnd a significant part of incremental cash flows are being driven to non-corebusinesses, which in our view are return dilutive. We estimate both ROCE (returns on capital employed) and RONW (return on net worth) falling from 12.5% and 14.1% in F2011 to 11.45% and 10.8%, respectively, in F2014."

Petchem spreads (except PVC) sustain, but volume sustenance at risk post 21% QoQ jump in 2QFY12: In polymers, PE and PP spreads over naphtha were up 2-9% QoQ but PVC spread was down 39% QoQ (at decade-low levels). Integrated polyester spreads were up 2-5% QoQ. Post the double-digit QoQ volume growth in 2QFY12, sustenance is at risk (amidst continued supplies from the Middle East); we suspect that producers might have given discounts over the list price to sell. Ad-hoc under-recovery sharing to continue in 3Q; full-year under-recoveries to cross INR1.3t: We expect under-recoveries to increase 56% QoQ to INR336b, led by high oil prices, increased international diesel prices and rupee depreciation. Under-recovery sharing would again be ad-hoc, and like the previous years, would be finalized in the last quarter. We model upstream sharing at 40%/38.8% and downstream sharing at 2%/ 10% for FY12/FY13, with the balance being the government's share. However, given that the government is already reeling under high fiscal burden, we believe there remains upside risk to our FY12 upstream sharing estimate. Valuation and view: With deterioration in the government's fiscal health, ONGC's earnings seem more vulnerable, as upstream share in overall under-recoveries is likely to be higher than our assumption of 40% in FY12. OMC stocks will be under pressure due to uncertain subsidy-sharing, poor GRM and increased borrowing costs, led by delay in compensation from the government. We maintain Neutral on GAIL and GSPL, asoperational earnings are unlikely to surprise positively, led by headwinds for incremental gas availability in India. Strong earnings sustainability augurs well for Petronet LNG. Though RIL has benefited from the rupee depreciation, we maintain Neutral to reflect reduced KG-D6 production, uncertain GRM environment, non-clarity on cash utilization, RoE reaching sub-15% and increased share (80%) of cyclical refining and petchem businesses in earnings. Cairn India, being an upstream pure play, is the largest earnings beneficiary of higher oil prices and rupee depreciation. With the closure of Cairn-Vedanta deal, we expect ramp-up in production and decision on investing in new areas, with huge free cash flows. Also, we await likely reserve upgrade and dividend policy. Our key assumptions: Our crude price assumption for FY12/13/14/long term is USD111.3/100/95/90/bbl. We expect the regional benchmark, Singapore Reuters GRM to remain in the range of USD7-9/bbl in the near term. We model Singapore GRM at USD8.4/bbl in FY12 and USD8.2/ bbl in FY13.

According to the research firm, For Q3FY12, under-recoveries on sale of HSD, SKO and LPG have increased to Rs.300bn as against Rs.214bn in Q2FY12. For Q3FY12, under-recoveries on sale of HSD, SKO and LPG have increased to Rs.300bn as against Rs.214bn in Q2FY12. Although oil prices have marginally averaged lower QoQ, under-recoveries have increased on account of weak rupee averaging at Rs50.8/&amp;amp;#36; in Q3FY12 as against Rs45.8/&amp;amp;#36; in Q2FY12.  There is no clarity on the subsidy sharing mechanism. However for our estimates, we assume 33.3% sharing by upstream companies (Rs.99bn). We also and account for 1HFY12 support of Rs150bn for OMCs announced by government in 3QFY12.&amp;amp;nbsp;  During the quarter, the benchmark refining margins declined to US&amp;amp;#36;6.25/bbl, compared to US&amp;amp;#36;8.8/bbl in 2QFY12 mainly on account of decline in gasoline and naphtha cracks. Also petchem margins too declined sequentially during the quarter on the back of weak demand. For RIL, we factor in lower GRMs for YoY and QoQ at US&amp;amp;#36;7/bbl, on the back of decline in benchmark Singapore refining margins and in light-heavy crude oil differential. Although rupee depreciation would benefit RIL as its product realisations are linked to dollar, decline in core margins for both refining and petchem would result in lower profitability sequentially and highlight possibility of a negative surprise to our net profit estimate of Rs52bn.

Currently, RIL charges &amp;amp;#36;0.135 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) market margin to cover for the risk and cost associated with marketing of gas. The Oil Ministry, which had long held that the marketing margin was a bilateral issue between the buyer and seller of gas, referred it to the EGoM after user industries like fertilisers sought a clarification on the legality of the levy. The ministry's technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), too, is of the opinion that RIL should share a part of these earnings with the government. It wants the marketing margin to be added to the gas sales price of &amp;amp;#36;4.20 per mmBtu and profit-sharing between the contractor and the government to happen at the combined rate of &amp;amp;#36;4.335 per mmBtu. At present, RIL and the government split profits at the gas sales price of &amp;amp;#36;4.20 per mmBtu after deducting the project cost. However, according to sources, in a letter written to the ministry on December 20, RIL has said that even gas utility GAIL India charges up to &amp;amp;#36;0.18 per mmBtu as a marketing margin on gas it transports and none of it is shared with the government. RIL, while defending its decision to impose a marketing margin over-and-above the government-approved sale price for KG-D6 gas has said that the levy was to cover for the risk and cost associated with marketing of gas. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company has also contested DGH's view, saying the marketing margin was a cost levied beyond the gas delivery flange and as such, was not regulated by the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The PSC provides for fixation of the gas price at the delivery point-- the point at which an upstream operator transfers custody of gas to a marketing and transportation agency. That point for the eastern offshore KG-D6 gas is Kakinada, in Andhra Pradesh, and the government had in 2007 approved a gas price of &amp;amp;#36;4.205 per mmBtu at the delivery point.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; "

The interested companies will submit non-binding bids for the 65% stake in the gas distribution company on Tuesday, the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. They declined to be named as the information is not public yet. Two of the sources said Indian energy major Reliance Industries had been keen on acquiring the stake, but a company spokesman denied any interest in the deal. Two European companies are also expected to submit bids, the sources told Reuters. They did not name the companies. BG India, a unit of the British oil and gas company, announced in November it was interested in selling its 65% stake in Gujarat Gas, a western India-focused gas distribution company. BG India, which acquired the stake in 1997, is looking to sell the stake as part of restructuring its asset portfolio. Globally, BG Group focuses on exploration &amp;amp;amp; production activities and liquefied natural gas. &amp;quot;We have started a process aimed at evaluating the potential sale of our interest in GGCL (Gujarat Gas). We will inform the market when we have something to announce,&amp;quot; a BG India spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. Most bids for the Gujarat Gas stake are likely to come around USD 600 million, the sources said, valuing the transaction, including the subsequent mandatory open offer, at close to USD 900 million. A GAIL spokesman was not immediately available for comment, while an Adani group spokeswoman and officials at GSPC could not be reached. Gujarat Gas, set up in 1980, currently supplies piped gas to 317,000 domestic and industrial customers and compressed natural gas to 144,000 users, mostly across Surat, Bharuch and Valsad in the western state of Gujarat. The company also operates a 3,700 kilometre-long gas pipeline network. It reported a net profit of 805 million rupees in July-September, on sales of 6.4 billion rupees. India's current gas demand of 166 million cubic metres a day (mmscmd) is projected to rise to 443 mmscmd by 2017, due to the growing number of power plants, industries and vehicles in Asia's third-largest economy. Slowing gas output from the Krishna Godavari gas fields, off India's east cost, has forced increasing imports of expensive LNG to feed demand in the fast growing economy. On Monday, shares in Gujarat Gas, which has a market value of USD 919 million, ended 0.3% lower at Rs 382 in the main Mumbai market that fell 0.2%."

A) Refining Segment 1) GRM for Q3FY12 would remain in range of &amp;amp;#36;5.9-6.9/bbl. Pressure on middle distillates will continue for remaining period of the year due to addition of new refining capacity in CY12 of 0.8mnbpd across the world. 2) Petcoke &amp;amp;amp; Sulphur spreads are continuously in negative zone and heavy weightage to LPG, Naphtha &amp;amp;amp; gasoline in RIL�s product slate is dragging RIL�s GRM discount to Singapore complex GRM (&amp;amp;#36;7.8/bbl in Q3FY12). 3) Flexibility in reconfiguration of RIL�s refinery product slate is limited to 10% only 4) Arab Heavy- Light differentials are on downward trend (&amp;amp;#36;3.2/bbl in Q3FY12). 5) Domestic gas (KG-D6) is totally replaced by Imported LNG (Contracted+Spot) for refinery captive power plant. Going forward we do not see any domestic gas flow to power plant. B) Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production Segment No positive guidance on gas output from KG-D6. The company has guided for gas production to be in the range of 40-45mmscmd in FY13. Ramp up in gas production is expected only in FY14. The company is negotiating current gas price (&amp;amp;#36;4.2/mmbtu) with government, which is based on crude prices at level of &amp;amp;#36;60/bbl. The company is demanding the revision of the prices to the current crude prices of &amp;amp;#36;110/bbl. Shale gas production is expected to touch 350-400bcf by the end of FY14. The company is also planning to acquire more shale gas assets in US. Q3FY12 avg gas output is seen at 41mmscmd. C) Petrochemical Segment: Polyester &amp;amp;amp; Polymer deltas are showing negative trend during Q3FY12. D) Deal with TV18:-RIL plans to invest in the range of Rs 1700-4000cr in TV18/Network18 promoter group. Network18 and TV18 together are issuingrights worth Rs 4000cr to fund the ETV acquisition.

ONGC believes that UD-1 gas discovery in the southern part of its Block KG-DWN-98/2 can produce for 14-15 years with peak of about 20 million cubic meters per day (mmcmd) lasting for five years, official sources said. The company detailed the production profile and the likely investment in the revised proposal for declaring the UD-1 find as commercial (called Declaration of Commerciality). Block KG-DWN-98/2 sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block where drop in reservoir pressure and water/sand ingress has seen output dip by over 35% to just over 39 mmcmd. UD-1 is the deepest gas discovery ever made in the country and ONGC estimates it may hold 4.257 Trillion cubic feet of inplace gas reserves, source said adding the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has accepted the DOC but with lower inplace volumes of 3.938 Tcf. Of the inplace reserves, ONGC estimates 2.55 Tcf can be recovered while DGH puts the figure at 2.315 Tcf. Sources said ONGC plans to drill 11 wells to bring the field to production by 2016-17 with an output of 585 million cubic feet per day (16.5 mmcmd). The production would rise to 715 mmcfd (20.24 mmcmd) in the second year and stay there for five years. Output from the seventh year would start dipping and it would be 86 mmcfd (2.4 mmcmd) in year 15. DGH, they said, found the discovery commercial after considering cumulative production of 2.315 Tcf with recovery of 58.5% for 15 years. It estimated a net present value (NPV) yield for ONGC at USD 200 million after considering USD 2.984 billion of capital investment and another USD 1.77 billion in operating expenses. ONGC has said Development Plan at this stage of the project remains conceptual and may change based on new data. Further as on date, there is no off-the shelf commercial production technology available with any company in the world to produce gas in such deep waters (2,841 meters), sources said adding ONGC believes that technological solutions would be available in next three years. The block KG-DWN-98/2 is divided into two - Northern Discovery Area and the Southern Discovery Area. The northern part has nine discoveries - Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1, R-1 (Annapurna), E-1, A1, U1, W1 and D-1/KT-1. The southern part holds the UD-1 discovery at a record depth of 2,841 metres."

Reliance, for long the darling of Indian investors, was briefly knocked off its four-year long perch as the country's most-valuable company in August -- first by state-run Coal India and then by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp -- before regaining it. TCS, part of the salt-to-software Tata conglomerate, is the first private-sector company to overtake Reliance in market value. Shares in Reliance, which owns the world's largest refinery complex, fell 2.7% on Friday to their lowest level since March 2009. The stock lost 34.5% in 2011, underperforming a 24.6% fall in the benchmark index. At Friday's close, Reliance was valued at about USD 42.7 billion, while TCS commanded a market value of USD 42.8 billion, despite its shares closing 0.4% lower. &amp;quot;This leadership game is becoming like a musical chair,&amp;quot; said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research at SMC Global securities in New Delhi. &amp;quot;If the underperformance in Reliance shares continues, it will become difficult for them to regain the top position again.&amp;quot; Reliance's growth outlook has been marred by falling gas output from its huge KG D6 gas fields, off India's east coast, which has drawn criticism from the country's upstream regulator, investors and analysts. A USD 7.2 billion deal to sell a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks to BP Plc struck earlier this year failed to impress shareholders, who are also looking for more clarity on the company's move to enter new areas such as retail and telecoms. &amp;quot;KG D6 has sort of become a drag,&amp;quot; Thunuguntla said. &amp;quot;And also, they have somehow got into a long-gestation trap in all their businesses -- be it oil and gas, retail or telecom.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They are sitting on a huge cash pile and need to deploy it at the right place. Holding cash is again not good,&amp;quot; he said. TCS, which competes with companies such as Infosys Ltd and Wipro in providing software services to western clients, saw its share price jump nearly 12% in the December quarter, compared with a 6% drop in the benchmark index. TCS has shed 0.4% on the year. Global technology spending outlook remains uncertain with no easy fix seen to the euro zone sovereign debt crisis and concerns about the US economy, but a sharp fall in the Indian rupee helps these exporters who get most of their revenues in foreign currencies while bulk of their spends are in rupee."

Consequently, RIL lost its long-held position (except for a brief period in August this year) of the country's largest company in terms of market valuation. In comparison to RIL's performance, TCS shares today ended with a modest loss of 0.35% at Rs 1161.25 and were earlier seen trading with a modest gain for most part of the trading session -- incidentally the last for 2011.  The performance of TCS stock was also a shade better than the barometer index Sensex, which fell by 0.57%. Earlier this month, RIL had also lost its position of the most influential stock in the Indian market to another IT giant Infosys.  RIL had been briefly dethroned from its position of the country's most valued company twice in August -- first to Coal India Ltd and then to another state-run firm ONGC. RIL's market value slipped below that of TCS for the first time at around 2 pm this afternoon and the country's biggest software exporter managed to retain the lead at the end of the trading session.  RIL has been among the best stocks to own in India for many years, but it continued to under-perform the overall market for most part of 2011, which has as such turned out to be a bad year for the stocks."

The entire Ambani family, including Mukesh and Anil, has been here together for the last two days to inaugurate a memorial for Dhirubhai Ambani, the legendary industrialist and founder of Reliance Group. The Chorwad house where Dhirubhai lived before leaving for Eden (now Yemen), has been transformed into a memorial, which was inaugurated by by the Ambanis' family guru Ramesh Oza (Bhaiji) in the presence of Kokilaben Ambani, her two sons and two daughters and other family members. A few years after Dhirubhai's death in July 2002, the two brothers had parted ways and formally split the business empire in 2006 after months of bitter rivalry and public spat. After the split, Mukesh took control of flagship Reliance Industries with interests in mostly energy and textiles businesses, while the younger sibling Anil got telecom, power, entertainment and financial services among others. The family reunion in Chorwad, in Junagarh district of Gujarat, took place after more than a year after the two brothers agreed in May 2010 to end their disputes and work together for an environment of harmony, cooperation and collaboration between their groups. Soon after arriving here on December 26, family matriarch Kokilaben had said that the two industrialist brothers had no differences between them and they are together now. &amp;quot;There are no differences or ill-feelings between Mukesh and Anil. Both the brothers will come to Chorwad with their families tomorrow (December 27)... This is our family function and entire family will be present at the function,&amp;quot; Kokilaben had said. Asked about the reported discord between Mukesh and Anil, Kokilaben had said: &amp;quot;There is love between the two brothers. That is why, they are coming together.&amp;quot; The family had last time congregated in Chorwad about 15 years ago in 1996, when a grand feast was organised for the villagers in the presence of Dhirubhai. Talking to mediapersons, Group President of Reliance Industries, Parimal Nathwani told reporters today that the Ambani family took part in a 'havan' (ritual) yesterday and the reunion culminated with 'raas-garbha' (dance) played at the Chorwadi temple premises. &amp;quot;This was completely a family function and therefore no friends were invited,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;The entire Ambani family got emotional at the inauguration of the memorial, which is nothing less than a Bharat Ratna type of fitting tribute to the patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani,&amp;quot; he added. He said it was significant that a memorial in his name came up at a place, from where Dhirubhai began his career as a young entrepreneur, while noting that a memorial in the name of an industrialist is unheard in this part of country. &amp;quot;The spiritual guru Ramesh Oza will also deliver a one hour discourse, which shall be attended by the Ambani family,&amp;quot; he said. The memorial is the same place where Dhirubhai spent his childhood. A rented section of the bungalow, then called 'Mangarolwalo Delo', was the place where he lived. Dhirubhai had later purchased the bungalow in 2002 which is now renamed as 'Dhirubhaino Delo'. The memorial has three sections - a picture gallery, the old residence of Dhirubhai and an auditorium. The sepia gallery depicts Dhirubhai's journey as captured by pictures, while his old dwelling is arranged the way it was and the auditorium is for screening a short film on his life. The two groups run by Mukesh and Anil command market value of Rs 243,300 crore and Rs 51,300 crore respectively. While the Mukesh-led group has two listed companies, Anil's group has six listed entities. The companies from both the groups saw their share prices declining in an overall weak market today. While Mukesh-led RIL dropped 1.95 per cent, another group company RIIL was down 2.5 per cent. From the Anil-led companies, RCom slipped 1.44 per cent, Reliance Capital fell 2.1 per cent, Reliance Infra was down 2.8 per cent, Reliance Power shed 0.42 per cent, Reliance Mediaworks was down 3.9 per cent and Reliance Broadcast Network declined by 3.3 per cent on the bourses. Earlier in the day, Anil visited the famous Somnath temple near Veraval. Anil, who had reached Somnath in a helicopter, performed pooja of the jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva before leaving for Chorwad."

While Reliance holds 60% interest in KG-D6, UK's BP Plc holds 30% and Niko Resources of Canada the remaining 10%. Reliance started natural gas production from the KG-D6 fields in April 1, 2009, with output of about 40 mmscmd.The MA oilfield currently produces about 12,715 barrels of crude oil per day. In addition, 1,831 barrels of condensate are produced from the field every day. The report said 14.89 mmscmd of the gas output is being sold to fertiliser plants and 22.02 mmscmd to power plants. The remaining 2.89 mmscmd is consumed by other sectors, including those fed by the East-West pipeline that transports gas from the East Coast to consumption centres in the West. Reliance had projected an output of 39.50 mmscmd of gas during December. As per the status report, out of the 22 wells planned in in Phase-I of D1 and D3 field development, 18 wells have been drilled and completed so far. Of these, 14 wells were put on production, while four wells were kept closed due to high water cut and sanding issues. "

All the 500 firms together recorded a collective turnover of Rs 45,79,911.38 crore in the latest financial year. Indian Oil Corp (IOC) was the biggest with annual revenue of Rs 3,23,113.12 crore, followed by Reliance Industries (RIL) with a full-year revenue of Rs 2,72,923.36 crore. Both IOC and RIL have retained their top-two ranks from the previous year, Fortune India said.  In this year's list, the two are followed by Bharat Petroleum (Rs 1,56,580.12 crore) at the third and State Bank of India (Rs 1,47,843.92 crore) at the fourth place. Other entities in the list are Hindustan Petroleum (5th rank), Tata Motors (6), Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp (7), Tata Steel (8), Hindalco Industries (9) and Coal India (10).  There are as many as six state-run companies in the top-ten positions, as against four from the private sector. The magazine said that the total sales of the country's 500 top corporations have grown by 21.5% from the last year, while their median growth has been even higher at about 25%.  &amp;quot;The good news, however, is that many of the Fortune India 500 companies are now beginning to shape the world's opinion of India for the better.

It may be true but there are 50% observers who are not fully convinced with the reasoning,&amp;quot; the source said. RIL was to drill 22 wells on the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in KG-D6 block by March 31, 2011 and 31 wells by March 31, 2012, as per the 2006 field development plan. But the Mukesh Ambani-run firm drilled only 20 wells till now, of which it has not put two of the wells on production yet. The source said failure of RIL to comply with its commitments made the oil ministry seek legal opinion. The SGI in its opinion quoted Section 3.2 of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) that states, &amp;quot;... amounts paid with respect to non-fulfilment of contractual obligations&amp;quot; can be disallowed for cost recovery. &amp;quot;...the expenditure incurred which has resulted in excess capacity / underutilisation of asset created on account of failure of the contractor (RIL) to adhere to the field development plan would fall within the provisions of Section 3.2,&amp;quot; SGI said. RIL has built facilities at KG-D6 to handle 80 million standard cubic meters per day of gas output which was expected by April 2012 but production currently is just 40.6 mmsmcd. &amp;quot;Excuse of geological uncertainty (for not drilling committed wells) does not wash with everyone,&amp;quot; the source said adding as the ministry contemplated next move, RIL slapped an arbitration notice challenging the proposed move to disallow a part of USD 5.7 billion expenditure already made in KG-D6 by restricting cost recovery in proportion to production. PSC for KG-D6, where drop in pressure in the wells and an increased water ingress lead to lower per-well gas output and halt in drilling pending more studies, allows operators to recover 100% of expenditure on exploration and production before sharing profits from the field with the government. It does not link cost-recovery to output. RIL and its new partner BP Plc of UK say new wells in KG-D6 can come up not before 2014. Incidentally, 2014 is also the year when the current USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit gas price for the block comes up for review. Production from KG-D6 field had reached 61.5 mmscmd in March 2010. However, from December 2010, the production started declining. The government had in 2006 approved an investment of USD 8.8 billion in two phases in developing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block (Phase-I: USD 5.2 billion and Phase-II USD 3.6 billion).

Raghavendran, the company's president of refinery business, said on Saturday. Reliance, which owns the world's biggest refining complex with total combined capacity of 1.24 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil, currently directly sells products into East Africa through its marketing firm Gapco. &amp;quot;Volumes going into Africa are far lower than the potential. Once African product specification comes up to Indian levels and global levels there will be a lot more potential,&amp;quot; Raghavendran said. Asked if Reliance is looking at expanding Gapco's operations on the continent, he said: &amp;quot;We are looking at opportunities and wherever there is some potential and it's economically justified we are looking at those.&amp;quot; Reliance currently exports most of the fuels from its giant complex as India does not compensate private refiners for selling fuels such as diesel and kerosene at subsidised rates mandated by the government. Gasoline prices were liberalised in June 2010. Its major markets are the United States, Europe, Latin America and Asia. Reliance is currently operating 600 fuel stations, mainly in western and southern India, out of the 1,400 it has in the country. Raghavendran said the company would not expand its local retail operations unless it gets a level playing field. &amp;quot;The world has to be the same for everyone,&amp;quot; he said. "

Two other global banks are also likely to join the list of bankers for the issue, one of the sources said. The terms of bond have not yet been decided, the sources said. A Mumbai-based spokesman for Reliance Industries, which the market values at nearly &amp;amp;#36;49 billion, had no comment when reached by Reuters. All the three banks also declined to comment. The Economic Times newspaper reported on Wednesday Reliance planned to raise funds with an interest rate of 2.25-2.50 percent, about 125-150 basis points above the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The sources said Reliance would use the funds to boost operations at its two refineries in western Gujarat state, which account for about a third of India's refining capacity, and for possible acquisition of overseas energy assets. Part of the proceeds could also be used to repay some existing debt, one of the sources said. Reliance, controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, the country's richest man with reported wealth of &amp;amp;#36;22.6 billion, has interests in refining, oil and gas exploration, petrochemicals and retail. The company has been looking to expand into telecom and financial services. Reliance raised &amp;amp;#36;1.5 billion in bonds in October last year in a two-part deal - a &amp;amp;#36;1 billion 10-year tranche and another &amp;amp;#36;500 million, 30-year bond issue. It also completed a &amp;amp;#36;1.091 billion, five-year term loan from foreign investors in August, its third syndicated facility in nine months. Shares in Reliance, which has the highest weighting in the benchmark market index, ended up 1.7 percent at 778.25 rupees, after having risen as much as 2.4 percent during the day, in a main Mumbai market that rose 0.7 percent. Indian issuers of overseas bonds have been kept on the sidelines in the last few months by volatile global markets. A slew of companies had announced plans, mandated banks or completed investor meetings for possible overseas issues, but the offerings were put on hold. Indian borrowers are especially price-sensitive and are reluctant to bring transactions in volatile markets that could upset pricing expectations. Indian companies raised &amp;amp;#36;6.6 billion in U.S. dollar bonds overseas in the first half of 2011, compared with &amp;amp;#36;2.6 billion in the same period a year earlier, attracted in part by lower yields overseas.

Mukesh Ambani, head of Reliance Industries, India's most valuable company, retained the top spot with a value of USD 22.6 billion, despite seeing his net worth drop by USD 4.4 billion. In the same period, Ambani completed construction of a 27-storey house in Mumbai, costing an estimated USD 1 billion. The biggest loser in the list was Ambani's younger brother, Anil, whose net worth stood at USD 5.9 billion, down from USD 13.3 billion. His Reliance Group companies have been some of the worst performers on the Mumbai bourse this year. A major drag for Ambani has been telecom firm Reliance Communications, which has USD 7.5 billion in debt and has so far failed in efforts to ease debt and raise money. The combined wealth of India's richest 100 people fell to USD 241 billion in 2011, according to the Forbes India Rich List, which includes 57 dollar billionaires, a dozen less than a year earlier. &amp;quot;This has been a turbulent year for India's richest,&amp;quot; Naazneen Karmali, India Editor of Forbes Asia, said in a statement. &amp;quot;Despite the economy growing at close to 8%, a spate of corruption scandals and rising inflation have taken a toll.&amp;quot; The world's second-fastest growing major economy after China grew only 7.7% in the three months to June, its weakest in 18 months, and Mumbai's benchmark stock index is down 16% since January. India has raised its interest rates 13 times in 19 months, hurting demand for big-ticket items and making it more expensive for businesses to raise capital. Of the 85 alumni from last year's list, 66 saw their worth drop this year. A net worth of USD 370 million was enough to make the 2011 list, down from USD 500 million a year ago.  Big Ten Mukesh Ambani lead a top ten dominated by industrial tycoons, including ArcelorMittal chairman Lakshmi Mittal, who came in second with a net worth of USD 19.2 billion. Energy and metal barons Shashi and Ravi Ruia lie fourth with a combined worth of USD 10.2 billion. Kumar Birla, head of the fabrics-to-cement Aditya Birla conglomerate, Adi Godrej of the Godrej Group and construction tycoon Pallonji Mistry -- the largest individual shareholder of the Tata Group and father-in-law to Noel Tata, touted as a likely successor to Ratan Tata -- are also in the top ten. Many of those companies are benefiting from India's plans to spend USD 1 trillion in the five years to 2017 to overhaul its creaking infrastructure, seen as a barrier to continued economic growth. Only one name from India's showpiece IT sector made the top ten: Azim Premji, chairman of Wipro, India's No. 3 software services provider, ranked third with a net worth of USD 13 billion.  Savitri Jindal, head of Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, was India's richest woman, sitting fifth on the list with a net worth of USD 9.5 billion. Jindal was one of only five women on the list of one hundred. A USD 39 billion telecom scandal, likely India's largest ever graft scam, made its mark on the list, with two accused in the case, Vinod Goenka and Shahid Balwa, falling out of the top 100. Both deny any wrongdoing. Debutants on the annual list include Kapil Bhatia and his son Rahul, founders of budget airline IndiGo, and V.G. Siddhartha, whose coffee shop chain Cafe Coffee Day gave him a net worth of USD 595 million. India's biggest gainer in percentage terms was Brijmohan Lall Munjal, head of two-wheeler HeroMoto Corp, whose net worth rose to USD 2.7 billion in the year his firm ended a 26-year partnership with Japan's Honda Motor. India's auto industry has seen car sales declining on high interest rates while families of four continue to buy two-wheelers, most of which can be bought without relying on loans."

Samvat 2067 that entered with much enthusiasm and high expectations would finally end with record number of negative developments from economic, political, cultural, social (domestic and global). Never in the past memory has the market seen so many events in a single year, most of which were negative. The unravelling of scams related to 2G, CWG, Housing, bribery, Euro Zone credit crisis, US debt ratings down grade by S&amp;amp;amp;P, geopolitical crisis in the Middle East and North African countries which eventually led to regime change in Egypt and Libya and earth quake in Japan, and so on. It was, as a matter of fact, a year of the Cleanse! If at all this leads to the cleaning of the Indian systems by eradicating corruption, the positive side of it all may be seen in the longer term. To make matters worse for the Equity markets, relentless rise in inflation led by food and non-food items, hawkish interest rates stance by RBI and policy paralysis of the government whose functioning were marred due to anti corruptions crusade, all led to sell off in equities. Sensex and Nifty on Monday Oct. 24th 2011 closed down 19 percent from their closing on Muhurat Day of Samvat 2067 at 16939 and 5098 respectively.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Samvat 2068 is likely to be better in terms of fundamentals as most of the negatives of the previous year get corrected this year. Significant changes may be seen in the latter part of Samvat 2068 only. We expect the next three-six months testing times for the market but gradually seeing improvement in fundamentals towards the other half of the SAMVAT 2068. The impact of the hardening policy is likely to bring down manufactured inflation hence giving reasons for the RBI to breathe easy and bring down rates. The Indian consumption boom is likely to be rejuvenated once interest rates come down.  This Diwali, we focus on only large cap companies that has fallen significantly from their peak and whose fundamentals remain strong in the longer term. We expect these companies to beat the index return during Samvat 2068. Our top picks are: L&amp;amp;amp;T Stock has traded at a 3 year consolidated P/E of 22.8 as per Bloomberg.

Historically RIL is known for its forward and backward integration which has created a size which is unmatched in Indian corporate history. Major reasons to shed RIL from portfolios have been in anticipation of its declining ROE.

With retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Carrefour circling India in anticipation of a rule change that would allow foreign investment in supermarkets, Asia's richest man is scrambling to capitalise on his early mover advantage. Over the past few months, Reliance has accelerated store openings, brought in a management team from Wal-Mart China and launched wholesale operations that serve the small mom-and-pop players dominating the &amp;amp;#36;450 billion Indian retail sector. It has also rolled out its first large-format hypermarket outlets selling everything from food to furniture. &amp;quot;In retail they are still a long way off,&amp;quot; said Michiel van Voorst, portfolio manager for Asia-Pacific equities at Robeco Hong Kong, which is considering buying into the stock it sold off three years ago, tempted by its 22% decline in 2011. &amp;quot;The business will still require a lot of investments, and there is no synergy to any of other activities of the company,&amp;quot; said van Voorst, whose firm manages USD 2 billion in Asia.   Reliance battles the same problems that have thwarted faster growth for organised retail in Asia's third-largest economy, including expensive real estate and opposition from politically powerful small shop-owners, farmers and middlemen. At the launch of the retail arm in 2006, the energy-focused conglomerate set out to build a USD 20 billion-revenue business by 2011. For fiscal 2011 ended March 31, however, retail sales were just Rs 5,677 billion (USD 1.1 billion), according to two analysts' estimates, an increase of 27%, but a tiny share of the group's total haul of USD 53 billion. Net loss in the business is estimated to have doubled to Rs&amp;amp;nbsp;446 billion. The company acknowledges its retail business is loss-making but declined to verify those figures.  Tough Market Reliance is the country's second-largest retailer by sales behind Future Group's Pantaloon Retail, but its overall market share is small in a country where more than 90% of the industry is made up of mom-and-pop stores. After launching operations in November 2006, it grew to about 1,000 stores within three years, but soon found it did not have the systems and infrastructure to support that expansion. Staff attrition, poor locations, supply-chain issues and infrastructure problems prompted it to shut nearly 50 stores within two years of the launch. Since then, the company has standardised its operations and increased centralisation of its supply chain. &amp;quot;During the 2008 slowdown, we thought we were insulated but we have learnt a lot from what we did ,&amp;quot; Bijou Kurien, chief executive of Reliance Retail's lifestyle arm, told Reuters. Reliance's supermarket push hit major hurdles in 2007 and 2008, when it was chased out of the states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous region, after protests by small-shop owners and farmers. Reliance still does not have supermarkets in Uttar Pradesh, which was supposed to generate 15% of its retail revenue by 2011. It also lacks a major store presence in eastern India. The standalone &amp;quot;kirana&amp;quot; shops, or neighbourhood mom-and-pop stores, and street-side vendors where most Indians buy groceries are popular because they are convenient and give credit. They also operate with little overheads, forcing chains to compete on razor-thin margins. Still, some of Reliance's local rivals including Pantaloons and Shopper's Stop have managed to make a profit, helped by a compact network of stores. &amp;quot;The idea is to expand and make money in every store that we set up, and that would be the way in which we scale the business,&amp;quot; Kurien said.  New faces, big boxes To jumpstart its retail business, Reliance recently brought in Wal-Mart China's former chief operating officer Rob Cissell to head its supermarkets, along with his ex-colleague Shawn Gray, making up the retailer's third management team since 2006. Its original management was replaced in 2009 with a team of expatriates led by Gwyn Sundhagul from Tesco Lotus in Thailand. He now works in another Reliance business. &amp;quot;We are now going into a phase of execution,&amp;quot; a senior executive at Reliance Retail said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. &amp;quot;Our hypermarket initiative is now being driven by someone who has done this earlier in China, which is a similar market.&amp;quot; The changes at the top coincide with an expansion push that saw it open 60 stores in the last quarter, including its first two hypermarkets, which opened last month. That brought its overall store count to about 1,050. The large-format stores are between 60,000 and 100,000 square feet and by next year will be supported by distribution centres in Delhi, Bangalore and Pune. &amp;quot;The quality and efficiencies are much higher. The margin mix improves considerably. Small stores bring you visibility, but you need the big boxes for balance,&amp;quot; the executive said. Reliance also last month opened its first cash-and-carry, or wholesale, store in Ahmedabad, entering a format which Wal-Mart already tried with six such outlets in India through a joint venture with the parent of telecoms firm Bharti Airtel. &amp;quot;We have also realised that 'kirana' stores will continue to coexist, so why not supply to them? It is an opportunity and we will not leave any opportunity,&amp;quot; the Reliance official said. Supermarkets account for 65% of Reliance's retail business, while specialty shops including local tie-up with global brands like Marks &amp;amp;amp; Spencer, and Diesel make up the rest. &amp;quot;Their big gap is how to stabilise and run the operations. They have to stick to one plan and move, and that is their biggest challenge,&amp;quot; said Pinakiranjan Mishra, head for consumer products and retail at advisory firm Ernst &amp;amp;amp; Young. &amp;quot;If you change the model every one-and-a-half, two years and if you change the team, everything has to be reset,&amp;quot; he said.  Financia Muscle The advantage Reliance holds over its Indian rivals is its financial muscle. While local chains, many of them loss-making and cash-constrained, look to hook up with the global players keen to enter India once rules allow, Reliance has the wherewithal and the intention to go it alone. &amp;quot;The area which is of concern for other retailers is finding capital. That is not so much a challenge for us,&amp;quot; said Kurien. Reliance, which owns the world's biggest oil refinery, boasted USD 12.6 billion of cash at the end of September. Reliance also has the advantage of time, as a politically weakened leadership in New Delhi drags its feet on allowing foreign investment into multi-brand retail, which is opposed by sections of the ruling Congress party as well as the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. Wal-Mart and others are expected to take years to build scale in a challenging Indian market. &amp;quot;There will certainly be competition, possibly price wars,&amp;quot; said Anish Sarkar, head of consulting at Capgemini India. &amp;quot;But the battle for the next few years will not be for market share but for expanding the market itself.&amp;quot; But not everyone is convinced that retail is the best use of Reliance's formidable resources. &amp;quot;I can understand if they want to invest in organised retail, but they should be investing in that outside of the main company, from separate capital,&amp;quot; Robeco's van Voorst said. &amp;quot;Otherwise there is concern that capital that yielded high returns is now deployed in assets that are not yielding much value,&amp;quot; he said. With growth in its core energy business below expectations over the past year, Reliance has been keen to diversify and has ventured into areas such as telecoms and financial services. Reliance is hopeful that the new management would exceed the 20 percent same-store sales growth that it is on track for this fiscal year, gradually giving the business higher visibility. &amp;quot;We have big plans for this business,&amp;quot; Kurien said. &amp;quot;We want to be the largest retail company in the country, as no one really remembers who came second.&amp;quot; (Editing by Tony Munroe and Vinu Pilakkott)"

Reliance: Open interest in Reliance has increased by 24% with the stock moving from 770 to 860 levels suggesting accumulation of long positions. The fresh build up in Reliance in the October series started on a low base. We believe roll spread in the stock may remain in the range of 2-4 points till settlement. The stock has seen the maximum Call base at 860 followed by 840 strike, which is likely to be the major resistance in the coming sessions.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;SBI: SBI witnessed addition of 26% open interest when it fell from 1930 to 1720 levels. However, when the stock recovered towards 1930 again, it witnessed closure of 10% short positions leaving almost 16% shorts in the stock. We expect these shorts to be rolled to the November series and the roll spread may not widen beyond 4 points. However, the spread may reduce to sub 1 level if the stock moves below 1850.&amp;amp;nbsp;HDFC Bank: Post September series, the stock observed selling pressure and plunged from 465 to 438 levels before it recovered back to 480 since the second week of October. However, no major change in open interest was seen during this volatile move. The previously rolled open interest from the September series had a long bias. We expect the same to be carried forward to the November series. The roll spread is likely to remain in the range of 1-2 points, which was seen near September settlement also.  TCS: Post the announcement of Infosys results, TCS added 21% open interest with long bias and the stock also moved up by 9%. Recently the stock surpassed the major resistance of 1080 which was the 1-year trend line below which it broke down in the month of August. However the recent disappoint in Q2 results may lead to long liquidation in the stock and it may be dragged towards 1000 levels. In such a scenario, the roll spread may shrink. The stuck up long positions are likely to be rolled into next series. The roll spread has already shrunk to 1 point in this series from 3-4 points seen in the previous series. We believe the rollover of long positions in declining stock may not keep the roll spread on the higher side and it may not widen beyond 1 point.

The firm, India's most valuable company by market capitalization, has seen its growth outlook and market value hit hard this year by falling gas output from its huge gas fields off the east coast. Reliance will halt drilling for an unspecified time until the review is completed and submitted to the government, three analysts present at a company meeting told the newspaper. A Reliance spokesman declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters. Controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, Reliance posted its highest ever quarterly net profit in its Q2 results on Saturday, but analysts focused on slowing gas output and said refining margins were still below expectations. Last month, India's upstream regulator said Reliance was producing 44 mscmd (million standard cubic metres per day) from its main D6 block, lower than the 60 mscmd it was producing a year earlier and far off the planned peak capacity of 80 mscmd. The CAG last month criticised Reliance and the government over development of the gas field in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin and called for revamping profit-sharing arrangements from oil and gas blocks. Earlier this year, Reliance sold a 30 percent stake in 23 oil and gas blocks, some in the KG basin, to BP in a 7.2 billion deal. The British company, with deepwater exploration expertise, has said it is confident of raising gas output from the field from 2014."

UTV Software said it had no immediately comment on the report, while Reliance could not be immediately reached.

Reliance has plans of building a data-focused business which will provide mobile, smartphone, tablet and computer users access to the net and online related services via a wireless broadband network. The diversified company, which has been under pressure from falling gas output, has pushed for tie-ups in recent months to boost its business.

RIL said no material relating to operational and technical matters relating to the KG-D6 block was sought from the company even though the CAG report has commented on them.  Stating that it was not given access to the full draft report of CAG for comments, the company said extracts that were previously held were only provided after the official auditor held the so-called 'Exit Conference' on July 12 to conclude the audit.  RIL was given just a week to respond and the company &amp;quot;did its best to send as complete a response given the time allotted&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Unfortunately, the CAG refused to consider any response submitted by RIL after the Exit Conference. Therefore, the fact is that CAG, for reasons best known to it, chose to ignore operational and technical fasts and data,&amp;quot; it wrote.  On non-relinquishment of block, RIL said: &amp;quot;Retention of discovery area is a geological issue and not an accounting issue. As such it is best settled by technical experts, which was also done in this case. CAG made no attempt to or even gave RIL the opportunity to explain how in geological terms the entire block did quality to be declared a Discovery Area as per the PSC.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Retaining acreage as Discovery Area in effect entails no benefit to the contractor,&amp;quot; it said adding RIL is willing to make a presentation to the CAG on the issues brought out by CAG.

The total value of M&amp;amp;amp;A deals in the first nine months of 2011 was largely accounted for by two inbound deals -- BP Plc's USD 7.2 billion transaction for acquisition of stake in Reliance Industries' oil and gas properties and Vodafone Group Plc's purchase of partner Essar's 33% stake in Vodafone Essar Limited (USD 5.46 billion). The Vodafone Group Plc/Vodafone Essar Limited deal announced in July was the second largest transaction recorded in the first nine months of 2011, boosting the Q3 inbound deal value to USD 7.32 billion, mergermarket said.

RIL on October 1 served a notice for suspension of supplies to plants of Indo Gulf Fertiliser, IFFCO, KRIBHCO, Shyam Fertilisers and Tata Chemicals from 0600 hours tomorrow, sources privy to the development said. The fertiliser firms, which produce about 2 million tonnes of urea from gas sourced from RIL, are opposed to providing financial guarantees in the form of letters of credit (LC) to cover for liabilities arising out of the levy of local sales tax on gas sales, as it would increase the cost of production and subsidy payouts. RIL supplies some 4 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 fields to these plants. Like elsewhere in the country, it has been charging central sales tax of 2 per cent from users in Uttar Pradesh. However, the state government has refused to accept these transactions as inter-state sales and have demanded that local sales tax of 21 per cent should be paid. Tax as the liability of consumers has been clearly enshrined in the Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPAs) RIL signed with fertiliser andother users. Naturally, users should have contested the demand for higher sales tax, but strangely, RIL went to the Allahabad High Court challenging the demand. The High Court on July 26, 2010, stayed the Uttar Pradesh government demand. The state government has appealed against the stay in Supreme Court. Sources said RIL is demanding that users in Uttar Pradesh enhance the value of their Letters of Credit, which were previously submitted as guarantees against default, to cover for payments in case the state sales tax liability was to materalise. So far, state power utility NTPC is the only firm that has enhanced its LC, while fertiliser firms have not complied with RIL's demand so far, leading to the notice for suspension of supplies. While the fertiliser firms refused comments, the Fertiliser Association of India (FAI) has shot off letters to the Oil and Fertiliser Ministry protesting against the RIL move. In an October 3 letter, FAI Director General Satish Chander said there was no need for enhancing the LCs as the Supreme Court has not vacated the stay given by the Allahabad High Court. &amp;quot;Any increase in the limit of LC will increase the cost of domestic urea production and has a direct bearing on the subsidy payable by the government. The demand of RIL for a higher LC is totally unjustified,&amp;quot; he wrote. RIL had last year, too, threatened to suspend supply to the fertiliser plants with effect from July 15, 2010, if the value of their LCs were not raised. While the threat was executed, RIL has again issued the notice because the tax liability, in case the Uttar Pradesh government's demand is upheld, amounts to a whopping Rs 750 crore. While Chander asked for the intervention of Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi and Fertiliser Secretary Sutanu Behuria in the matter, sources said RIL has also informed the Oil Ministry of the notice for suspension of supplies. Chander said any disruption in RIL gas supply will affect production of urea, whose demand has been &amp;quot;very good&amp;quot; because of heightened agricultural activity on the back of the good monsoon. &amp;quot;Any loss in production of urea will have to be met through higher imports. We will be substituting low cost urea production in the country by a very high cost of imported urea. The country will end up paying heavily through the exchequer,&amp;quot; he wrote. Fertiliser companies would also be liable to pay a penalty under the 'ship or pay' clause of their Gas Transportation Agreements with Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd (RGTIL) and state-owned GAIL India Ltd. &amp;quot;The Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) has allocated the gas to fertiliser units on a priority basis for full capacity utilisation of urea plants in view of fertiliser being an essential input for agriculture. RIL's decision to unilaterally decide to stop the supply of gas to fertiliser plants in UP is unjustified and also violative of the decision of the EGoM,&amp;quot; he added."

Reliance on September 16 submitted to the Oil Ministry a formula for pricing of 3 million standard cubic meters per day of CBM it plans to produce from Sohagpur block in Madhya Pradesh, sources privy to the development said. The formula is the same as the one at which RasGas of Qatar sells liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a long-term contract to India. According to the formula, Reliance wants 12.67% of the prevailing Japanese Crude Coctail (JCC) plus 0.26 per mmBtu, they said. JCC is now ruling around USD 100 per barrel and CBM price according to this formula comes to USD 12.67 per mmBtu plus USD 0.26 per mmBtu, totaling USD 12.93 per mmBtu. But industry observes scoffed at the price sought saying RasGas supplies gas rich in compounds like ethane (C2) and propane (C3) which are useful in manufacture of LPG and petrochemicals. Whereas, CBM is just methane (C1) and should therefore be priced at least 15-20% discount to the price of rich or C2/C3 compound-rich gas. Also, LNG pricing cannot be applied for domestic gas as huge investment goes into putting a liquefication plant that turns natural gas into its liquid state by cooling it at sub-zero temperature. Sources said Reliance in the price approval letter states that the formula it is suggesting is arrived at on an arms-length basis. RasGas prices the 7.5 million tons a year (about 30 mmscmd) gas it sells to Petronet LNG Ltd at 12.67% of JCC. Another USD 0.26 per mmBtu is the cost it takes for shipping the gas cooled to turn it into liquid (called LNG) in cryogenic ships. Reliance has lifted this formula and has sought pricing of its CBM in line with that. Great Eastern Energy Corp Ltd (GEECL) is selling CBM is produces from its Raniganj block in West Bengalat USD 6.79 per mmBtu while domestically produced natural gas is priced at USD 4.2 to USD 5.73 per mmBtu. The natural gas Reliance produces from its eastern offshore KG-D6 fields is priced at USD 4.205 per mmBtu for five years ending March 31, 2014. Sources said Reliance has sought expeditious approval of the CBM price so that it can sign gas sales and purchase agreements (GSPAs). The company plans to feed Sohagpur gas to state-owned GAIL's HVJ trunk pipeline for supply to customers."

Accompanied by Reliance Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani, he is scheduled to meet Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy in the forenoon on Wednesday and several others before ending the day with a dinner hosted by British High Commission here. Dudley and Ambani are likely to call on Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Commerce Minister Anand Sharma and former Oil Minister Murli Deora among others.

Ambani is likely to host a dinner for Dudley on Thursday evening at his residence in Mumbai. Sources said Dudley's visit is more of a thanks giving on conclusion of the USD 7.2 billion deal and a possible kick-off for a partnership with Reliance. Though the government had after nearly six months given its go ahead to the deal last month, BP has not yet formally been inducted as amendments to the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) are yet to be approved and signed by the upstream oil regulator DGH. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 22 cleared the sale of stake by RIL to BP in 21 blocks, including the showpiece eastern offshore KG-D6 gas producing area and discovery area NEC-25. However, it held back the same for two inconsequential blocks one a deep sea area off the Orissa coast and the other an onland block in Assam - over technical issues. The formal letter conveying the approval was however sent only in August. The deal, which might increase in value to USD 20 billion on the basis of future performance payments and investment, will give Reliance access to BP's expertise in deepwater drilling and accelerate development and production from its fields, particularly the under-performing KG-D6 block in the eastern offshore. For BP, which has been struggling to recover from the disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster last year, the transaction is a chance to enter a market where energy demand is growing at 5-8%. "

Reliance had in December, 2009, submitted to the regulator an optimised development plan for four satellite gas fields around the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6, block. It proposed to invest USD 1.529 billion in producing up to 10 million standard cubic metres per day from the four discoveries in five years' time. &amp;quot;Considering the production profile (drawn up by the DGH) and the cost estimates and project schedule as provided by operator (Reliance), the project yields a negative Net Present Value of USD 239 million at the gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal units,&amp;quot; the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) told the Oil Ministry in a note seeking approval for the development plan. Reliance projected first gas from the Dhirubhai-2, 6, 19 and 22 (D-2, D-6, D-19 and D-22) fields in 2016. The DGH said if royalty is excluded from project cost and capital expenditure is phased over a period of two years before the date of first gas extraction, the project becomes marginally viable. &amp;quot;The projected total revenue and Net Present Value (NPV) of the cash flow at a 10% discount factor are USD 2,360 million and USD 33 million, respectively. The project becomes marginally economically viable,&amp;quot; it said. But royalty in any case has to be paid to the government. Reliance had in 2007 proposed a price of USD 4.33 per mmBtu for gas from KG-D6. The government however tweaked the formula and fixed the sale price at USD 4.205 per mmBtu for the first five years of production. DGH has evaluated the new finds in KG-D6 at the government-approved price and did not consider a higher rate that may be fixed in 2014, when the price comes up for review. Reliance has so far made 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. It had in July, 2008, submitted a field development plan for nine satellite gas discoveries (D-2, D-4, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-16, D-19, D-22 and D-23) with an estimated capex of USD 5.6 billion and reserves of 1,708 billion cubic feet (BCF). The DGH, the paper said, carried out techno-economic feasibility studies at a gas price of USD 4.2 per mmBtu and projected total revenue and NPV at a 10% discount factor at USD 6.52 billion and negative USD 2.51 billion, respectively. The regulator then told Reliance that the development plan needs to be optimised. Reliance submitted the optimised development plan for the four satellite gas fields in end-2009. Reliance estimated 1,733 BCF of in-place gas reserves in the four finds, of which 626 BCF can be produced. However, the DGH trimmed down the estimates to 1,342 BCF and 617 BCF, respectively."

The ministry and its technical arm, the DGH, are upset with RIL because production from the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) gas fields in the prolific KG-D6 block has fallen from 61 million cubic metres per day in March, 2010, to about 37 mmcmd, instead of rising to 61.88 mmcmd, as projected by the company when it got its USD 8.8 billion capital expenditure plan for development of the field approved in 2006. The ministry has attributed the fall in output to non-fulfillment of RIL's commitment to drill 22 wells in the field. RIL has so far spent USD 5.694 billion on the two fields and has recovered USD 5.258 billion from the sale of gas produced. However, the ministry wants to limit cost recovery in the block in proportion to the slippage in output vis-a-vis the stipulated timeline, reducing RIL's entitlement to USD 3.405 billion. The firm however feels such a move would be ultra vires, or beyond the ministry's powers, as the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) does not have any such provision and the USD 1.85 billion already recovered by RIL cannot be reversed. &amp;quot;If the PSC were indeed to be re-written to link cost recovery to levels of production, it would also have to include provisions for allowing the contractor (RIL) to recover costs in excess of his investment in case he were to achieve a rate of production higher than that estimated at the time of capex approval,&amp;quot; RIL senior vice-president (commercial) B Ganguly wrote to the ministry on September 16. RIL said production below the original estimates meant the company loses its right to recover its investment within the originally estimated timeframe, causing huge losses in terms of sunk capital. Besides, RIL has already suffered huge erosion of market cap due to news of the fall in production. RIL said as per the PSC, all costs and production numbers provided in the field development plan (like the one approved for KG-D6 in 2006) are only estimates based on the understanding of the reservoir and the market prices at any given point of time and &amp;quot;such estimates cannot be construed as constituting a commitment under the PSC.&amp;quot; KG-D6 wells did not perform as per the FDP, as a severe drop in reservoir pressure and acute water ingress has already forced closure of two out of the 18 well drilled so far. The Oil Ministry's views have been backed by Solicitor General of India that said RIL should not be allowed to recover the cost of facilities that remain underutilised due to lower than anticipated output at its KG-D6 gas field. SGI Rohinton F Nariman on August 17 opined that &amp;quot;the cost/expenditure incurred in constructing production/processing facilities and pipelines that are currently underutilised/have excess capacity cannot be recovered&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;There is no provision under the production sharing contract (PSC) that can limit cost-recovery to either production levels achieved by a contractor or to the extent that facilities are utilised under a development plan at any given point of time,&amp;quot; RIL wrote. &amp;quot;To even suggest that the contractor should, over and above this loss, forego his basic investment by foregoing cost recovery would be contrary to the fundamental notion of the PSC,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Any such attempt being contrary to the letter as well as spirit of the PSC would only trigger unnecessary disputes between the contractor and the government leading to needless arbitration proceedings,&amp;quot; it added. The initial field development plan (FDP) for the D1 and D3 gas fields in the KG-DWN-98/3 block (KG-D6) envisaged a capex of USD 2.47 billion at a peak production rate of 40 mmcmd from 14 wells. Subsequently, RIL submitted an addendum saying the size of the gas reserves was twice the estimate of 5.32 tcf in the initial plan, at 11.3 trillion cubic feet. It proposed a USD 8.835 billion capex over two phases and envisaged a peak output of 80 mmcmd from 31 producing wells by April, 2012. Commercial gas production from the D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 fields commenced from April 1, 2009. RIL in December, 2009, tested its field production facilities at their full rated capacity of 80 mmcmd, during which time an average gas rate of 77-80mmcmd was maintained for a brief period of three days. Subsequently, the gas production rate was maintained at 57-61 mmcmd for a four-month period (January, 2010, to April, 2010). Subsequently, the gas production rate has gradually declined and the current rate is about 37 mmcmd, as against the approved FDP rate of 61.88 mmcmd for the year 2011-12. RIL says the gas production rate will remain in the range of 40-38 mmcmd, as against the projected peak of 80 mmcmd, till mid-2013 and also that no new well will hooked up to production facilities till mid-2013-14. The ministry claims that the DGH has repeatedly asked RIL to comply with the approved FDP work programme by drilling two more wells and connecting two other wells to its production system by the first quarter of 2011-12 fiscal. It asked RIL to drill another nine wells by March 31, 2012. However, RIL has failed to comply with the directive and to penalise the firm, the Oil Ministry has now threatened to restrict cost-recovery on a pro rata basis at the current production rate of 37 mmcmd, reducing RIL's entitlement to USD3.405 billion."

Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singh had last month informed Parliament that output from KG-D6 was short of 70.39 mmscmd envisaged by now as per the field development plan approved in 2006. &amp;quot;The contractor (Reliance) was advised by (oil regulator) DGH to expeditiously drill more development wells in D1 and D3 field as per FDP in order to enhance gas production in KG-DWN-98/3 block,&amp;quot; he had stated. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the committed 22 wells on D1 and D3 as reservoir has not performed on expected lines. Of the 20 wells drilled, only 18 wells are under production. Further in the FDP approved in 2006, Reliance had committed to drill 31 wells by the current fiscal-end. Reliance currently holds 90 per cent interest in KG-D6, while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling 30% in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for USD 7.2 billion. Reliance started natural gas production from KG-D6 fields from April 1, 2009. Its partner Niko had last month stated that &amp;quot;declines (in production) are expected to continue until work-overs are completed and/or additional wells are tied-in&amp;quot;. The present output is less than about 60 mmscmd production in the same period a year-ago. "

Responding to upstream oil and gas production regulator DGH reopening the issue, RIL Executive Director P M S Prasad on August 24 wrote to Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi saying the USD 0.135 per million British thermal units marketing margin is a cost levied beyond the gas delivery flange and as such, is not regulated by the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The PSC governs fixation of price of gas at the 'delivery point', the point at which an upstream operator transfers custody of gas to a marketing and transportation agency. That point for eastern offshore KG-D6 gas is Kakinada, in Andhra Pradesh, and the government had in 2007 approved a gas price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu at the delivery point. But the DGH wants the USD 0.135 per mmBtu levy added to the gas sale price and profits for RIL and the government to be calculated thereafter. Currently, profits are calculated by deducting capital and the operating cost from the gas sales price only. Prasad, however, said the PSC does not provide for such a move, as the marketing and transportation cost cannot be recovered from revenues earned from sale of oil or gas. Section 3.2 (iii) of the PSC states that &amp;quot;costs of marketing or transportation of petroleum beyond the delivery point are not cost-recoverable. Both marketing and transport costs are clearly recognised as being distinct from the sale price at the delivery point and kept outside the PSC for purposes of cost recovery,&amp;quot; he wrote. He said any attempt to include the margin as part of the price of gas approved under the PSC &amp;quot;will have the effect of making all marketing costs as well as ensuing risks and liabilities cost-recoverable under the PSC.&amp;quot; Moreover, such inclusion can be done only after amendment of the present PSC. The marketing margin is to cover for cost of employees involved in marketing and sales, related infrastructure and all legal and operational expenses that occur beyond the delivery point, as defined in the PSC.  It also covers the credit risk of buyers, litigation costs and penalties such as ship-or-pay reimbursement to transporters and levies for supplying off-spec gas. &amp;quot;Any costs associated with these risks are at the moment not chargeable to the PSC for the purpose of cost-recovery and are not being claimed as such by&amp;quot; RIL, he added. He pointed to state-run ONGC and GAIL charging a marketing margin on government-administered gas, called APM gas, as well as on the produce from the Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields."

Sources privy to the development said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had been pressurising RIL to drill the committed 22 wells by March 2011, so that Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields can produce projected 61.88 mmcmd and MA field (also in the same block) another 8.1 mmcmd. But when RIL, which was not confident of the geology after pressure at current 18 wells fell and some showed water ingress, refused, DGH proposed to allow only proportionate recovery of cost. On DGH insistence, oil ministry sought a view from the second highest law officer of the country. SGI Rohinton F Nariman on August 17 opined that &amp;quot;the cost/expenditure incurred in constructing production/ processing facilities and pipelines that are currently underutilised/have excess capacity cannot be recovered&amp;quot;. The Production Sharing Contract (PSC), however, does not envisage such a move and if oil ministry is to order such a thing, RIL is likely to challenge it and may initiate arbitration proceedings. Sources said no field development plan by any company anywhere in the world, including 40-50 put by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), have gone exactly as per the plans put on paper because of uncertainty involved in behaviour of what lies several thousand feet below the earth. ONGC had on about a dozen occasions changed field development plan for its prime Mumbai High oil and gas fields. RIL is waiting for BP Plc, who has global expertise in deepsea exploration, to come on board before recommencing drilling at KG-D6. Nariman in his opinion states that the government has &amp;quot;an arguable case&amp;quot; to stop RIL from recovering expenditure which had &amp;quot;resulted in excess capacity / under-utilisation of the asset created&amp;quot; on account of its failure to adhere to the 2006 approved field development plan. According to the 2006 plan, RIL was to drill a further 11 wells by March 2012 to raise output to 80 mmscmd and sustain it at those levels for 9 years. RIL has so far spent USD 5.693 billion and has already recovered USD 5.258 billion from sale of gas. Nariman advised that to the extent RIL has already recovered capital expenditure from sale of gas, &amp;quot;the cost entitlement of the contractor can be reversed&amp;quot;. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report on KG-D6 field audit, which was tabled in Parliament earlier this month, had not commented on reasonability of RIL hiking the capital expenditure at the nation's biggest gas field from USD 2.4 billion proposed in 2004 to USD 8.8 billion estimate in 2006. It, however, stated that with the gas output from KG-D6 falling to about 43 million standard cubic meters per day, which is close to 40 mmscmd output level envisaged in the 2004 investment plan, raised &amp;quot;doubts if upgradation to 80 mmscmd with substantial increase in development cost (to USD 8.8 billion) was justified&amp;quot;. RIL submitted an initial development plan (IDP) for Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds in May 2004 with capital expenditure of USD 2.4 billion. This was followed up with an Addendum to the IDP (AIDP) in October 2006 proposing USD 5.2 billion capex in Phase-1 and USD 3.6 billion in Phase-II. &amp;quot;Most procurement activities were undertaken late in the line with the schedules of the IDP of May 2004. By contrast, activities in respect of items in the AIDP were initiated even before the submission/approval of the AIDP. Clearly, the development activities of the operator were guided by AIDP, rather than IDP,&amp;quot; CAG had said in the report."

Verification of charges and credits relating to the contractor's activities were not merely limited to an arithmetical totalling. &amp;quot;Such an exercise would extend to verifying whether the costs being depicted in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) accounts by the contractor, which would critically affect the determination of profit petroleum and government's share therein, are correctly determined,&amp;quot; it said. The CAG emphasised that all its enquiries and findings emerge from and were limited to the PSC. &amp;quot;We do not profess to go into a procedure or policy related aspects leading to the conclusion of the PSC.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The challenge of the operator (Reliance) with regard to the experience of the institution of the CAG in conducting audit of oil and gas exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) is unwarranted. &amp;quot;This institution has been conducting audit of India's largest E&amp;amp;amp;P company, ONGC as well as Oil India Ltd for several decades. The collective audit expertise of our institution is adequate to meet the challenges of scrutiny of hydrocarbon PSC,&amp;quot; it added. In its response, the oil ministry in July, 2011, had agreed that scope of audit conducted by the CAG was within the common audit parameters and indicated that financial or accounting audit also envisages review of activities and resources contributing to financial events and the controls thereon."

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its final report on Rajasthan block audit, tabled in Parliament, said Cairn had in 2006 proposed USD 1.24 billion for developing the Mangala oil field in the block. A revised field development plan (FDP) was submitted three years later in 2009 due to change in delivery point of crude oil from Barmer in Rajasthan to Salaya and later to Bhogat in Gujarat, which necessitated laying of pipeline. &amp;quot;On June 30, 2009, the Management Committee approved the revised FDP at a cost of USD 2.367 billion, plus USD 941.05 million as the cost of the pipeline, plus USD 35.61 million as cost of Mangala (field) enhanced oil recovery (scheme); ie a total cost of USD 3.34 billion,&amp;quot; it said. The increase in revised FDP was primarily attributed to nearly doubling of upstream capital cost during 2005 and 2007, increase in rig hiring charges and delay in project schedule. Reliance too had cited more or less similar reasons for raising capex for Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds in the prolific KG-D6 block from USD 2.4 billion proposed in May 2004 to USD 8.8 billion (USD 5.2 billion in Phase-1 and rest in Phase-II) in October 2006 as it built facilities to handle 80 million standard cubic meters per day as against 40 mmscmd previously. The CAG said the oil ministry had informed that the increase in capex was also due to changes in the production facilities in view of increased production rates from 100,000 barrels per day to 125,000 barrels per day. &amp;quot;Most of the expenditure under the revised FDP (of Cairn) has been/would be incurred from 2008-09 and thereafter; this would be covered in future audits,&amp;quot; it said. The auditor said USD 201.54 million expense incurred by Cairn on works like exploration in development area DA-1, should not be eligible for cost recovery. &amp;quot;We also found excess expenditure of USD 27.63 million on pre-development and development activities over the approved budget for 2007-08 of USD 160.56 million, which has not been ratified by the MC,&amp;quot; it said. The CAG said 13 fresh discoveries were made during or between the appraisal phase and in the development phase in areas already delineated as development areas. &amp;quot;Consequently, in our opinion, the declaration of fresh discoveries during the appraisal/ development phases within delineated discovery/development areas amounted to irregular extension of exploration activities, which is not consonance with the terms of the PSC,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;This also indicates that the discovery/development areas were not strictly delineated, and included excess area,&amp;quot; CAG said. &amp;quot;Further, there were instances of non-compliance with regard to the PSC provisions for notification of potential commercial interest, appraisal programme, submission of field development plans etc,&amp;quot; it added."

The much-awaited final audit report of CAG, which was tabled in Parliament today, however did not quantify how much the government lost when Reliance hiked the capital expenditure at the nation's biggest gas field from USD 2.4 billion proposed in 2004 to USD 8.8 billion estimate in 2006. The CAG faulted the Oil Ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), for allowing Reliance to retain the entire 7,645 sq km KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) block in the Bay of Bengal after the giant Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds were made in 2001. &amp;quot;We could not derive assurance regarding reasonableness of costs incurred, primarily due to lack of adequate competition (in bidding for contract)... with consequential adverse implications for cost recovery and Government ofIndia's financial take,&amp;quot; the report said. The CAG said with the gas output from KG-D6 falling to about 43 million standard cubic meters per day which is close to 40 mmscmd output level envisaged in the 2004 investment plan, raised &amp;quot;doubts if upgradation to 80 mmscmd with substantial increase in development cost (to USD 8.8 billion)was justified.&amp;quot; Maintaining it was yet to see the report for detailed comments, Reliance in a press statement said, &amp;quot;We reiterate that, as a contractor, we remain committed to complying with the PSC provisions and procedures including adopting Good International Petroleum Industry Practices (GIPIP) in ouroperations,&amp;quot; it said. The official auditor was unhappy about the lack of adequate oversight and government control over procurements done by private firms and wanted high value purchases to be more specifically approved by government representatives. It wanted &amp;quot;in-depth review&amp;quot; of 10 contracts, including the eight awarded to Aker Group by Reliance on a single-bid basis. In particular it was critical of the USD 1.1 billion contract to put up a production facility at MA oilfield in the same KG-D6 block to Aker on a single bid basis after disqualifying other qualified bidders. The CAG faulted the Oil Ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), for allowing Reliance to retain the entire 7,645 sq km KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) block in the Bay of Bengal after the giant Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds were made in 2001. As per the PSC, Reliance should have relinquished 25% of the total area outside the discoveries in June, 2004, and 2005, but the entire block was declared as a discovery area and the company was allowed to retain it. &amp;quot;We recommend that the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas should review the determination of the entire contract area as 'discovery area' strictly in terms of the PSC provisions,&amp;quot; the CAG said, asking for delineation of the discovery area and relinquishment of the rest. CAG sought review of the production sharing contracts, like the one Reliance had signed for KG-D6 in 1999 when BJP-led NDA was in power, saying the regime was designed to encourage hike capital expenditure by private contractors thereby reducing the government's share. &amp;quot;Given the similar conclusions that two independent agencies have reached as regards the adverse impact of the profit sharing mechanism in protecting Government of India's share designed in the late 1990s, there does seem to be enough ground to revisit the formula,&amp;quot; it said. CAG said the current PSC regime provides &amp;quot;substantial incentive to increase capital expenditure or 'front-end' capital expenditure&amp;quot; so that government take from the blocks is lower. For future PSCs, CAG recommended that the Investment-Multiple linkage with the profit sharing formula be removed. &amp;quot;Instead, the biddable profit-sharing percentage should be a single percentage. This will reduce the incentive for skewed volume and timing of capital expenditure resulting in very low Government of India share of profit petroleum. &amp;quot;Further, in order to ensure a modicum of control, very high value procurement decisions above a specified limit should be subject to approval by the Management Committee, more specifically the approval of the Government of India representatives,&amp;quot; it said. On Reliance's KG-D6 cost capex increase, it said &amp;quot;approval of estimates (first USD 2.4 billion and then USD 8.8 billion in 2006) does not constitute acceptance of the cost projects&amp;quot;, which can be done only through an audit of the actual cost incurred. Reliance submitted an initial development plan (IDP) for Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas finds in May 2004 with capital expenditure of USD 2.4 billion. This was followed up with an Addendum to the IDP (AIDP) in October 2006 proposing USD 5.2 billion capex in Phase-1 and USD 3.6 billion in Phase-II. &amp;quot;Most procurement activities were undertaken late in the line with the schedules of the IDP of May 2004. By contrast, activities in respect of items in the AIDP were initiated even before the submission/approval of the AIDP. Clearly, the development activities of the operator were guided by AIDP, rather than IDP,&amp;quot; it said. While expenditure incurred in 2006-07 and 2007-08 was audited by CAG, remaining expenditure incurred from 2008-09 onwards would be covered in the future audit. CAG faulted Reliance for awarding a USD 1.1 billion contract to put up a production facility at MA oilfield in the same KG-D6 block to Aker on a single bid basis. &amp;quot;During our scrutiny of the operator's records, we have come across instances, where multiple vendors were pre-qualified. However, when technical bids were received, all vendors (except one) were rejected, and the contract was finally awarded on a single financial bid,&amp;quot; it said. CAG said such disqualification of vendors on technical grounds, after a pre-qualification process and bidders' meeting for technical clarifications, limits the competitiveness which was not in accordance to the PSC. Seeking in-depth review in the award of 10 contracts (of which 8 were awarded to Aker Group companies), it said, &amp;quot;We are not even remotely suggesting that the operator should follow government procurement procedures, yet any commercially prudent private acquisition would also attempt to generate competition and thereby obtain the most competitive price.&amp;quot;"

The ministry has conveyed its displeasure to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) at the highest levels over the reopening of a long-settled issue, sources privy to the development said. It feels the DGH is wrongly interpreting the contract, which clearly states that the government is entitled to get a share of the price of gas at the delivery point. On the other hand, the marketing margin charged by the Mukesh Ambani-led firm is to intended to cover the risk involved in carrying gas from that delivery point to customers' door-step. The DGH recently asked Reliance to add the USD 0.135 per million British thermal units marketing margin to the KG-D6 gas price of USD 4.205 per mmBtu for the purpose of calculation of the government's profit take. Sources said the ministry feels a Pandora's Box will be opened if the DGH move is approved, as public sector firms like GAIL India, too, have been charging a marketing margin, which is higher than what is being levied by Reliance, for several years now. The same principle will have to be applied to gas produced from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which is marketed by GAIL. But to settle the issue once and for all, the ministry plans seek an opinion from the Law Ministry, they said. The DGH demand also runs contrary to the stance the Oil Ministry took on the issue in Parliament last year. The then-Oil Minister Murli Deora had on February 24, 2010, told the Rajya Sabha that the marketing margin was a bilateral issue between the seller (Reliance) and the buyers.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  The government approved the price for gas sales at the delivery point of the KG-D6 field as per the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract inked with Reliance. &amp;quot;The said price (USD 4.2 mmBtu) does not include any charge beyond the PSC delivery point. The marketing margin (levied by Reliance) is beyond the delivery point and arises as a result of the gas sale and purchase agreement signed between the seller and the buyer,&amp;quot; Deora had stated. The PSC provides for sharing of revenues from the sale of gas between the government and the contractor at the said price at the delivery point. It does not envisage sharing of revenues earned by the contractor from marketing margins with the government, he had further said. The marketing margin was in lieu of the risks and costs incurred by the contractor on marketing the gas. It is to cover risks like seller liabilities in case of non-supply, customers drawing less than their quota, non-payment of dues and settlement of disputes.  Sources said the DGH wanted the marketing margin to be added to the gas sale price of USD 4.20 per mmBtu so that profit-sharing between the contractor and the government is calculated at the total price of USD 4.335 per mmBtu charged by RIL from its customers. At present, Reliance and the government split profits at the gas sales price of USD 4.20 per mmBtu after deducting the project cost. Besides marketing risks, the USD 0.135 per mmBtu margin is charged by Reliance on account of its extensive efforts to identify customers, execute and manage gas sales and purchase agreements (GSPAs), as well as gas sales planning, daily gas sales operations, gas accounting and invoicing and collection, sources said. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group had in 2009 opposed the levy of a marketing margin by RIL, but agreed to pay it unconditionally after an Oil Ministry clarification. Other gas marketers like state-run GAIL India also charge a marketing margin.

In July, India's cabinet had approved Reliance's plan to sell 30% stake in 21 oil and gas blocks to BP as part of a USD 7.2 billion deal, making it one of the largest investments in India's oil and gas sector.  &amp;quot;We have just received the approval. We are studying the data. We are confident that there is more gas and output can be raised. But these things take time, it may take a couple of years,&amp;quot; BP India head Sashi Mukundan said. Reliance Industries, the country's largest listed firm, has been under pressure over the past few months from an industry regulator and investors over slowing gas output from its main D6 block in the KG basin off the Andhra Pradesh coast. In May, the director general of hydrocarbons said the company was producing 48 mscmd (million standard cubic metres per day of gas) from the block, lower than 60 mscmd it produced last year and far off the planned peak capacity of 80 mscmd. But India's approval of Reliance's plan to sell stake in some oil and gas blocks to BP is expected to aid the Indian company in boosting output from the deepwater blocks. Shares in Reliance rose as much as 3.6% on Tuesday in the Mumbai market that was up 0.6%. The stock is down more than 20% so far this year, mainly triggered by concerns about slowing D6 output."

A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra allowed Mohd Furqan, a journalist, to withdraw his petition and file it at an &amp;quot;appropriate time&amp;quot; on the ground that it was &amp;quot;premature and inadequate.&amp;quot; The bench, however, said he can file a fresh petition at a later stage. &amp;quot;We allow to withdraw the writ petition and file it at an appropriate time. The prayer is allowed,&amp;quot; the bench, also comprising Justice Pradeep Nandrajog, said. The petition had sought a direction to the government for cancellation of license of RIL for exploration of gas in the KG basin alleging the firm, as per the CAG report, had increased the expenditure for exploration almost four times. &amp;quot;How we can direct the Centre to cancel the license&amp;quot;? the court said, adding there was absence of detailed data about the KG basin. The journalist cited the CAG report saying the increase in the expenditure of the company was deductible before sharing the revenue with the Government. The report of the auditing body was&amp;amp;nbsp;a&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;preliminary&amp;quot; one which is not &amp;quot;justiciable&amp;quot; and hence, the plea was &amp;quot;pre-mature and inadequate, the court said. The High Court had on August 24 decided to constitute a special bench to hear a plea seeking a direction to the government for cancellation of license granted to RIL for exploration of gas in the Krishna-Godavari basin. The decision to refer the matter before a special bench was taken by the Chief Justice as Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who was sitting with him in the bench, had recused from hearing the case. Justice Khanna did not spell out the reasons for opting out of the hearing of the case. The petitioner had also sought a direction to the Centre to take over the control and management of the KG gas project immediately from the JV. He said even after CAG reported &amp;quot;serious violation&amp;quot; of rules in the KG basin, the government is not taking any action though he has made several representations to the Centre in this regard. The central government has granted license to a joint venture of RIL and NICO for exploitation of natural resources of the KG basin. In the petition it was alleged that the JV has cheated the government by inflating the expenditure as there is a provision in the revenue-sharing agreement that RIL is entitled to recover all expenses before sharing it with the government. &amp;quot;Under the revenue-sharing agreement between the government and the JV, the JV is allowed to recover all costs before revenue is shared. The higher the cost of the JV, the revenue available to the government will be lower. Byinflating the expenditure... the JV has cheated the government and their license is liable to be cancelled,&amp;quot; it said. Earlier, the petitioner had moved Supreme Court which had directed him to approach the high court."

In the sense that your chemical refining margins depends more on what is happening globally and on the E&amp;amp;amp;P side I do not see any positive news at least for the next 12-15 months.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You will see production for the KG D-6 block that is somewhere about 45-48 cubic meters per day. The valuations have become fairly attractive, so the stock can bounce back 10-15% from current levels. If you look at sum of the parts valuation based on 2013 numbers we have Rs 1045, the stock is about Rs 780, so you have a fairly large upside over there.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;If you look at the valuations of the chemical refining portion that alone comes to about Rs 600 per share- add to that the value of investments, cash etc so by the end of 2013 this company should be sitting at about Rs 200 of cash in investment. The stock price is not discounting any value for E&amp;amp;amp;P part. I think that is the positive. If any positive surprise comes from the E&amp;amp;amp;P part, I think that will be taken very positively by the market.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Some of the short-term triggers, which the management can actually play a role could be if it steps out dividends or&amp;amp;nbsp;cancels treasury shares or does a buyback, I think that can sure up sentiments for the stock. Currently the company is&amp;amp;nbsp;sitting on large amount of cash and once it gets the BP money, USD 500 and it is generating a fair amount of cash flow, the best way to demonstrate confidence in the companies ability have too much of immediate capex just distribute the cash to shareholders and that would anyways provide some sort of support to the stock price.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Let us see what the management does. One of the things which can definitely do is cancel the treasury share. It makes no sense for the company to be hanging on to the treasury share at this point of time. The company has enough of cash, it does not have any great capex lined up, so it does not require the treasury shares and optically at least earnings numbers can look up smartly. For example if you are looking at Rs 65 EPS, if you cancel the treasury share then you would look at EPS which is closer to Rs 72 in which case the stock is trading at about 11 times and at least on a PE basis the stock starts looking attractive. It is just an optical thing but on a sentiment basis I think it is a positive move.&amp;quot;"

Industrialist Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries said in a statement that the completion of the deal has paved the way for commencement of its strategic alliance in India with BP. &amp;quot;This significant step will commence the planned alliance which will operate across the gas value chain in India, from exploration and production to distribution and marketing. Reliance Industries overtakes ONGC as most-valued company &amp;quot;The completion of the deal delivers one of the largest ever foreign direct investments into India,&amp;quot; RIL said. RIL will get USD 7.2 billion for the stake sale in 21 blocks and could get further USD 1.2 billion as performance payments based on exploration success resulting into development of commercial deliveries. Commenting on the completion of the deal, RIL Chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani said: &amp;quot;The alliance with BP will boost our efforts to realise the true potential of India's hydrocarbon reserves.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The globally renowned expertise of BP and the in-depth domestic experience of Reliance make for a formidable alliance which will deliver unparalleled value for the country in its pursuit of energy security,&amp;quot; he added. RIL said that the two companies would also form a 50-50 joint venture for sourcing and marketing of gas in India which will also accelerate the creation of infrastructure for receiving, transporting and marketing natural gas. BP Group CEO Bob Dudley said: &amp;quot;This major investment is directly aligned with our strategy of creating long-term value by forming alliances with strong national partners, gaining material positions in significant hydrocarbon basins and increasing our exposure to growing energy markets.&amp;quot; RIL is India's largest private sector company with a turnover of Rs 2,58,651 crore (USD 58 billion) and net profit of Rs 20,286 crore (USD 4.5 billion) in the last fiscal ended March 31, 2011. It had on February 21 agreed to sell 30% stake in 23 out of its 29 oil and gas blocks to BP. Earlier this month, the company said that it has received the government approval for sale of stake in 21 blocks. However, the approval has been held back for two blocks -- one a deep sea area off the Orissa coast and the other an onland block in Assam -- over technical issues. Regarding the two remaining blocks, valued at about USD 2.2 million, RIL said the discussions were continuing with the government and a decision was expected &amp;quot;at a later date&amp;quot;. RIL said the 21 blocks include the KG D6 block that produces about 1.7 billion cubic feet of gas per day, which was over 40% of India's total gas output. RIL would remain operator of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and BP will bring its global deepwater, sub-surface and gas expertise to enhance exploration and development of the blocks. The total value of the deal could rise to as much as USD 20 billion on the basis of future performance payments and investment and would give Reliance access to BP's expertise in deepwater drilling and accelerate development and production from its fields, particularly the KG-D6 block. RIL might also use BP's deepwater expertise to tackle the technical issues in the KG-D6 block. RIL is the operator in all 23 blocks, while Canadian firm Niko Resources and UK's Hardy Oil have minority 10% interest in a few. After the deal, RIL's holding in the blocks will come down to 60-70%. 19 out of the 23 blocks lie off the East Coast, while two blocks are in Assam and Gujarat. Niko has 10% interest in the KG-D6 block and after the BP deal, RIL's stake would fall to 60%. Besides KG-D6, RIL's second biggest discovery block is NEC-25, off the Orissa coast. It has so far made 15 exploratory successes in the block, where Niko holds a 10% stake. Following the BP deal, RIL's stake in this block will fall to 60%."

Reliance produced about 44.8 mmscmd of natural gas during the week ending August 14, according to the status report filed by the company with the oil ministry here. The output comprised 37.7 mmscmd from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields and 7.1 mmscmd from MA oil field in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block. As per the status report, out of the 22 wells to be drilled in the Phase-I of Dhirubhai-1 and 3 field development plan, 18 wells have been drilled and completed so far. During August 8 to 14, 16 wells were put on production as two wells (B2 and B13) were kept closed due to high water cut. MA oilfield produced an average of 13,688 barrels of crude oil per day besides the 7.1 mmscmd of associated gas. Of the total 44.8 mmscmd, about 14.6 mmscmd of gas was sold to fertiliser plants and another 26.2 mmscmd to power plants. The remaining 4 mmscmd was consumed by other sectors like sponge iron plants, LPG, city gas distribution networks and petrochemical/refineries. Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singh had earlier this month informed Parliament that output from KG-D6 was short of 70.39 mmscmd envisaged by now as per the field development plan approved in 2006. &amp;quot;The contractor (Reliance) was advised by (oil regulator) DGH to expeditiously drill more development wells in D1 and D3 field as per FDP in order to enhance gas production in KG-DWN-98/3 block,&amp;quot; he had stated. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the committed 22 wells on D1 and D3 as reservoir has not performed on expected lines. Of the 20 wells drilled, only 18 wells are under production. Further in the FDP approved in 2006, Reliance had committed to drill 31 wells by end of current fiscal. Reliance currently holds 90% interest in KG-D6, while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling 30% in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for USD 7.2 billion. Reliance started natural gas production from KG-D6 fields from April 1, 2009. Its partner Niko had earlier this month stated that &amp;quot;declines (in production) are expected to continue until work-overs are completed and/or additional wells are tied-in&amp;quot;. The present output is less than about 60 mmscmd production in the same period a year-ago. "

In the past few days, a veritable game of musical chairs has been played out between the country's most-valued firms on the bourses.  Earlier, on August 17, state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL) had dethroned RIL to become the country's top-valued firm.  Then, two days later on August 19, RIL briefly slipped to third position in the valuation charts, after CIL and ONGC, only to reclaim the No. 2 position by the market close.  CIL's stint at the top proved to be short-lived, with RIL reclaiming this position within six days on August 23.  A day later, on August 24, CIL lost further ground and slipped to third position in the valuation charts after RIL and ONGC.  CIL continues to be the country's third-most valued company, with total market capitalisation of Rs 2,31,052 crore this morning. "

With a market valuation of Rs 2,37,842 crore, slightly higher than RIL's Rs 2,35,571 crore, the PSU energy major reclaimed the top position from the private sector corporate giant after a gap of nearly four and half years. However, ONGC's lead over RIL is barely about 1% (about Rs 2,200 crore) and their performances would be keenly watched when stock market resumes trading next week. RIL had first toppled ONGC to become the country's most-valued firm way back in late 2006, but the state-run energy giant later reclaimed the top position, albeit only for a few brief period. RIL has managed to stay on the top since February 2007, except for past few days. A situation similar to game of musical chairs is evident in the stock market for past few days when there have been many twists and turns in the top positions of the country's most valued firms. Earlier on August 17, state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL) dethroned RIL as the top-valued firm, ending the private sector energy's giant over four-year reign at the top. Two days later on August 19, RIL briefly slipped to the third position after CIL and ONGC but returned to the second slot at the time of the market closing. However, CIL's top position proved to be short-lived as RIL reclaimed this position within six days on August 23. A day later on August 24, CIL lost further ground and slipped to the third position after RIL and ONGC. By afternoon trade today, another major change was seen on valuation charts when ONGC raced past RIL to the top slot. Thereafter, a close race was seen between the two energy giants as they pipped each other several times within minutes. However, PSU giant ONGC emerged victorious at the end of the day with a higher market capitalisation than that of RIL. Marketmen would be keenly watching RIL and ONGC shares when trading resumes next week to see whether ONGC will manage to retain and extend its lead over RIL or the private sector corporate giant bounces back to reclaim its top position, as it did after losing out to CIL last week. ONGC's lead over RIL stands at a little over Rs 2,000 crore, which is barely about 1%. In a weak market, shares of both Reliance Industries and ONGC fell today, but losses were sharper for RIL. While RIL was weak for the entire day almost, ONGC could not sustain the gains witnessed earlier in the trading session. RIL shares closed 4.61% down at Rs 719.50, while ONGC fell 1.49% to Rs 278 at the BSE. At the end of yesterday's trade, RIL was the country's most-valued firm with a market valuation of Rs 246,965 crore, followed by ONGC's Rs 241,436 crore. Both the stocks are trading at their lowest levels in many months. Coal India, the third most valued company after ONGC and RIL, also fell sharply with a loss of 3.9% in its share price and commanded a market value of Rs 2,27,231 crore. ONGC, RIL and Coal India are followed by TCS, Bharti Airtel, ITC, NTPC, Infosys, SBI and HDFC Bank among the top 10 most valued companies. The top three have market values in excess of Rs two lakh crore, while others are valued above Rs one lakh crore each."

The firm has made 10 discoveries in the KG Basin's KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' showpiece producing KG-D6 gas fields, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas RPN Singh said today. &amp;quot;ONGC has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (and) Directorate General of Hydrocarbons requesting permission for drilling eight additional exploratory/appraisal wells in block KG-DWN-98/2 and also seeking an extension of the exploration period for drilling these wells,&amp;quot; he said a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha. The state-run firm estimates that the block holds an in-place volume of 25.61 million tonne of oil and 197 billion cubic metres of natural gas. It is proposing an investment of over USD 7.7 billion to produce up to 30 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the block. Singh said ONGC had submitted a proposal last year to declare its UD-1 ultra deep-sea gas discovery in the southern part of the block as commercial, a step toward developing the find. The Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) of the Northern area finds in the block were submitted by ONGC in July, 2010. &amp;quot;Since the said DoC was not approved at the Operating Committee (an oversight panel for the block), it could not be evaluated and the operator was asked to submit the OperatingCommittee-approved DoC,&amp;quot; he said. ONGC bought 90% interest in the block from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn still holds 10% in the block. Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area -- Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna). Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries -- E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1/KT-1 and the first ultra-deepwater discovery UD-1, at a record depth of 2,841 metres. The block is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U and A, while the ultra deep-sea UD find lies in the SDA. Don't miss: RIL sub-lets sole drilling rig to Malaysia's Petronas"

Reliance has sub-let its Transocean-owned ultra-deep water drillship Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2 to Petronas at least till the year-end, industry sources said. Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2, a high specification ultra-deep water drillship capable of operating in 12,000 feet of water and drilling to 35,000 feet, may drill two wells for Petronas off the coast of Brunei, beginning next month, which may take up to four months to complete. Following the move, Reliance does not have any operational offshore drilling rigs in Indian waters, sources said. Reliance had in March last year received Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2 from Transocean on a five-year contract at a day rate of USD 510,000, sources said, adding that the Mukesh Ambani-led firm is charging the same day rate from Petronas. A company spokesperson did not reply to an email sent for comments. Reliance has not drilled all of the wells it had committed in 2006 to win approval for investing up to USD 8.8 billion on its showpiece eastern offshore KG-D6 block. Natural gas production from the block, at 47 million cubic metres per day, is 31% less than the target, a phenomenon which the oil regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), says was on account of not drilling the required number of wells. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the 22 wells committed by March, 2011, in the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields of the KG-D6 block. As per its 2006 commitment, the number of producing wells should go up to 31 by the end of the current fiscal. Sources said without a drilling rig, it cannot drill any well this fiscal. The DGH wants Reliance to immediately take up drilling of the 11 committed wells so as to raise output, which had in March last year touched 61 mmcmd. Production has since late last year declined amid falling pressure in the wells. Reliance currently holds 90% interest in KG-D6, while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling a 30% stake in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for over USD 7 billion. In 2009, Reliance had sub-let another rig, Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-1, to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) at a dayrate of USD 495,000 to 510,000 for four years (about Rs 3,195 crore). ONGC was to pay a day rate of USD 495,000 to Reliance for the first 180 days and USD 510,000 from the 181st day onward."

Justice Khanna did not spell out the reasons for opting out of the hearing of the case. The court was hearing a petition filed by M Furquan, a journalist, seeking a direction of the court to the Centre for cancellation of licence granted to a Joint Venture (JV) of RIL and NICO in KG-D6 for exploration of natural resources. The petitioner also sought a direction to the Centre to take over the control and management of the Krishna-Godavari gas project immediately from the JV. He also said even after government auditor CAG reported &amp;quot;serious violation&amp;quot; of rules in KG basin, the government is not taking any action though he has made several representation to the Centre in this regard. &amp;quot;Even after CAG reported serious violation about KG basin contract, government is not taking any action ,&amp;quot; he said. In his petition, Furquan alleged the JV has cheated the government by inflating the expenditure as there is a provision in the revenue-sharing agreement that RIL is entitled to recover all expenses before sharing it with the government. &amp;quot;Under the revenue-sharing agreement between the government and JV, the JV is allowed to recover all costs before revenue is shared. The higher the cost of the JV, the revenue available to the government will be lower. By inflating the expenditure... JV has cheated the government and their licence is liable to be cancelled,&amp;quot; Furquan pleaded. The petitioner furhter said it is the duty of the government to ensure that the resources of the nation are being used in the best interest of citizens of India. &amp;quot;The Constitution of India envisages exploration, extraction and supply of gas to be within the domain of governmental function.

Block 18, a 21,140 sq km concession located off the Batinah coast, was relinquished by the conglomerate's wholly-owned Dubai-based subsidiary, Reliance Exploration and Production DMCC. The decision follows an exploratory drilling campaign that failed to unearth any significant prospects, the Oman Daily Observer report said. The move comes six years after Reliance inked a deepwater Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement with the Oman government for Block 18 in the Sohar Basin in June, 2005. While withdrawing from the concession, Reliance stated that the results of its drilling campaign targeting Block 18 had &amp;quot;not been encouraging&amp;quot;.

State-owned Oman Oil Company Exploration and Production (OOCEP), which had acquired a 30 per cent interest in Block 18 under a farm-out agreement signed in October, 2009, is unlikely to take over the concession and the Ministry of Oil and Gas is expected to remarket the block. In conjunction with the farm-out agreement, OOCEP also signed a Joint Operating Agreement with Reliance, which provided the basis for setting up a joint operating company to be managed by the two companies upon a commercial discovery being established in Block 18. Meanwhile, Reliance is currently focused on the development of its sole existing concession in Oman, Offshore Block 41, which covers an area of around 23,800 sq km off the Sharqiya coast.

Reliance Exploration and Production DMCC's portfolio currently consists of 12 blocks spread across Oman, Yemen, Kurdistan, East Timor, Peru, Australia and Colombia, the report said."

At the end of today's trade, Reliance Industries (RIL) commanded a market value of Rs 2,50,648 crore on the BSE, higher than any other listed company in the country. In the process, RIL moved past Coal India, which had dethroned RIL as the country's most valued firm on August 17, on the market valuation charts. RIL shares today rose by 1.23%, outperforming a little below one per cent rise in the benchmark index Sensex, to settle at Rs 765.55. At the same time, shares of Coal India under-performed the overall uptrend in the market and ended 0.9% down at Rs 391.90. This brought down the state-run coal major's market valuation to Rs 2,47,538 crore. Earlier in the day, CIL had even slipped below ONGC to the third position in market valuation charts, but PSU energy giant lost ground in the afternoon trade and its shares ended the day at Rs 279.15 with a 2.65% decline -- the maximum for any Sensex stock in today's trade. ONGC had a market valuation of Rs 2,38,826 crore at the end of today's trade, making it the country's third most valued company after RIL and CIL. In late morning trade, the shares of all three -- RIL, CIL and ONGC -- were trading in the red and losses were much sharper for the coal major. At 1145 hrs, RIL had the top market value of Rs 2,46,507 crore on the BSE, followed by ONGC's Rs 2,42,847 crore and CIL's Rs 2,41,822 crore. While RIL was down 0.44% at Rs 752.90, ONGC was 1.01% down at Rs 283.85 and CIL was trading 3.15% lower at Rs 382.85 at that time. However, RIL rebounded sharply in afternoon trade, CIL also pared some of its losses and ONGC lost further ground. At the end of yesterday's trade, Coal India was ranked the most valued company with a market capitalisation of Rs 249,685.88 crore, followed by RIL's 249,685.88 crore and ONGC's 245,328.68 crore. CIL toppled Reliance Industries on August 17 to emerge as the country's most valued firm, thus ending the private sector corporate giant's over four-year reign at the top of the market valuation charts. Two days later on August 19, RIL briefly fell behind ONGC to the third position in the market valuation charts, but returned to the second slot before the market close that day. CIL and ONGC have been closing the gap on RIL in terms of market valuation for the past few weeks, as RIL's stock has been under selling pressure and the two PSUs have been mostly performing well even in a weak market. However, a sharp rally in RIL stock for two trading sessions and today's fall in CIL shares helped the private sector corporate giant regain its lead over the coal major. RIL had first toppled ONGC to become the country's most valued firm way back in late 2006, but the state-run energy giant later reclaimed its top position, albeit only for a brief period. RIL has managed to stay on the top since February, 2007, except for the past few days. The recent bout of volatility in stock market has led to many upheavals in the market valuation charts. Coal India and ONGC had come very close to challenging RIL's top-position last month also, while the rankings of other top-10 companies have also undergone many changes in the recent past. IT major Infosys, which once figured among the top-five companies, has now slipped to the ninth position, while ICICI Bank has moved out of the top-10 to 11th slot. At the same time, ITC has moved to the fifth position. In the top-10, RIL is now followed by Coal India, ONGC, TCS, ITC, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, SBI, Infosys and HDFC Bank. Out of these, the top-three have market value in excess of Rs two lakh crore, while the others carry a valuation of more than Rs 1 lakh crore."

The Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) draft report said energy major Reliance Industries had inflated development costs on its D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin and cited a joint venture of Reliance with BG and ONGC for hiking development costs in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti gas fields.

Reliance, owned by Mukesh Ambani, the world's ninth richest man, saw its crown seized by Coal India, the world's largest coal miner, whose stock in energy-hungry India is the best performer this year on the country's top index. Reliance has been under fire over the past few months from the upstream regulator, investors and analysts due to slowing gas output, sending its shares down over 29% this year, compared to an almost 19% fall in the main index. Analysts on Thursday talked down the chances of RIL retaining its top spot in the near future, due to Coal India's surging growth outlook and margin worries across Reliance's other sectors, such as refining and petrochemical production. Fund manager JP Morgan Asset Management halved its holding in Reliance between March and June this year. BlackRock Asset Management have reduced its position by nearly 29% between March and April, according to Thomson Reuters StreetSight. UTI Asset Management has cut its positions in Reliance while increasing its holding in Coal India. The two companies are separated only by a thread. As of mid-day trade on Thursday, Reliance had a market cap of Rs 2.45 trillion (USD 54 billion) while Coal India's market cap stood at Rs 2.49 trillion (USD 55 billion). Coal heats up State-owned Coal India has surged in Asia's third-largest economy, which aims to halve its peak-hour power deficit of nearly 14% in two years by ramping up generation. The miner accounts for nearly 80% of India's coal output. The Kolkata-based miner has seen its shares rise over 25% this year, after the Indian government sold a 10-percent stake for USD 3.4 billion in the country's largest IPO ever last November. Templeton Asset Management, Blackstone Group and Allianz Global Investors are among funds that have expanded their portfolios to include Coal India since April, according to Thomson Reuters StreetSight.  India is likely to import 135 million tonnes of coal this fiscal year, to meet a forecasted 11% rise in demand, and Coal India is in talks for acquisitions in Indonesia, Australia and the United States.  Reliance, which became India's largest company by market capitalization in February 2007, is looking to expand beyond its core businesses into telecom, financial services and in June said it planned to invest aggressively in retail. Results from the fiscal first quarter showed a 16.7% rise in net profit last month, but analysts cautioned of a peak in refining margins and predicted further slowdown in its oil and gas business, which already lag estimates.  In May, India's upstream regulator called on Reliance to drill two extra wells this fiscal to meet gas production targets at a flagship block off the country's east coast. "

ONGC yesterday signed a seven-year contract with Forbes Bumi Armada Offshore Ltd (FBAOL) - a joint venture between Malaysia's Bumi Armada and BSE-listed Forbes &amp;amp;amp; Co Ltd - for hiring a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO), officials said here. Reliance Industries has been using a FPSO since September, 2008, to produce oil from its MA field in the predominantly gas-rich KG-D6 block off the East Coast. Bumi owns a 49.99% stake in the joint venture that has leased the FPSO to ONGC, while the remaining 50.01% is held by Forbes. Officials said this was the first time ever that ONGC has hired a FPSO to produce oil. Till now, it has been using fixed platforms standing in the middle of the sea to produce oil from offshore fields. A FPSO is a converted or custom-built ship-shaped floater used to process oil and gas and for temporary storage of oil prior to transshipment. The FPSO processes oil coming from undersea wells and stores it before transferring it for sale to refineries for processing. ONGC has hired the FPSO for a seven-year fixed term time charter, with a further six-year annual extension period at ONGC's discretion. The FPSO will have a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels per day and 580,000 barrels storage capacity. The D1 field lies about 200 kilometres off the coast of Mumbai in a water depths ranging from 85 to 90 metres and is currently producing 16,000 bpd of oil through the Sagar Laxmi jack-up-based early production system (EPS). The field was developed in two phases. Phase-I development was completed in 2006-07 by drilling seven wells, while Phase-II development was completed in 2008-09 by drilling the remaining five wells. Peak oil production of 17,500 barrels per day was achieved from the field after Phase-II development. Presently, the field is producing approximately 16,000 bpd."

The upgrade was completed on Tuesday and today the field is back to its normal production level, industry sources said. MA oilfield produces a little less than 15,000 barrels per day of oil and about 7.6 million standard cubic meters per day of natural gas from the five wells. Gas output was shutdown completely for only one day, they said adding production was down about 3 mmscmd during the rest of the period.

But the shutdown period had been curtailed and the field was back to normal a day ahead of the schedule. Sources said wells in the MA field had not been shutdown during the maintenance of FPSO, which pumps out oil from the field. The wells continued to produce oil and gas. The Krishna Godavari basin Block KG-DWN-98/3 (D6) has 19 oil and gas finds. Of these, the largest, Dhirubhai-1 and 3 finds and an oil field, MA, have been put into production.

In event of output falling below what has been allocated to core users, fuel will first be supplied to fertiliser plants to their full requirement, then to LPG plants, power and lastly to city gas users.

The present output is made up of about 8 mmscmd from the MA oil field in the predominately gas-rich KG-D6 block off the Andhra coast. The rest comes from the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) gas fields, the largest of the 18 natural gas finds Reliance has made in the block. &amp;quot;The contractor (Reliance) was adviced by (oil regulator) DGH to expeditiously drill more development wells in D1 and D3 field as per FDP in order to enhance gas production in KG-DWN-98/3 block,&amp;quot; he added. Singh however did not mention if Reliance has complied with the direction of drilling more wells. He also did not say what action the government could take in case of default. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the committed 22 wells on D1 and D3 as reservoir has not performed on expected lines. Pressure in the wells has dropped sharply and there is an increased water ingress, resulting in lower per-well gas output. Of the 20 wells drilled, only 18 wells are under production. Further in the FDP approved in 2006, Reliance had committed to drill 31 wells by end of current fiscal. Reliance currently holds 90% interest in KG-D6 while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling 30% in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for over USD 7 billion. To a separate question, Singh said an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) had in September 2007, after considering the price proposal submitted by Reliance-Niko, approved a price formula for gas produced from KG-D6 for five years from date of commencement of supply. &amp;quot;The price obtained from the basis/formula (approved by EGoM) comes to USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit for crude oil price (if it is) equal or greater than USD 60 per barrel,&amp;quot; he said. Reliance started natural gas production from KG-D6 fields from April 1, 2009."

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, today approved BP buying stake in RIL's 21 blocks, sources said. The CCEA could not meet on its scheduled day yesterday as the oil ministry had not circulated the agenda in time. RIL, India's most valuable company, had on February 21 agreed to sell 30% stake in 23 out of its 29 oil and gas blocks to London-based BP Plc for USD 7.2 billion, and may get an additional USD 1.8 billion if the two explorers find more hydrocarbons. The CCEA approved sale of stake only 21 blocks as exploration status in the two remaining blocks was in dispute. BP will have to furnish a bank guarantee and performance guarantee as has been prescribed under the production sharing contract. The deal, that may increase to USD 20 billion with future performance payments and investment, will give Reliance access to BP's expertise in deep-water drilling and accelerate development and production at its fields particularly the under-performing eastern offshore KG-D6. For BP, which has been struggling to battle back from the disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil-spill disaster last year, the transaction is a chance to enter a market where energy demand is growing at 5-8%. Officials said Reliance had on February 25 applied for government nod for the stake sale. New Exploration Licencing Policy, under which Reliance had won the oil and gas blocks, allowed for sale or assignment of participating interest(farm-out), which is routinely approved by the oil ministry. But the ministry, even though competent to approve the deal, decided to refer it to the CCEA. Reliance may use BP's deepwater expertise to tackle the technical issues in the sub-surface of KG-D6 block. Dhirubhai-1 and -3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block have seen output falling to 39 million cubic meters per day from 50 mmscmd achieved in March last year. Reliance has been forced to restrict oil production from the MA field, in the same area, to about 15,000 barrels per day due to high water and gas cut. Together with 8 mmscmd of gas produced from MA field, KG-D6 block in the week ended July 10 produced 46.8 mmscmd as against 61.5 msmcmd in March last year. As per projections, the output should have risen to 69 mmscmd by now. Besides addressing the reservoir issues in KG-D6, BP is expected to help Reliance quickly put into production 9 satellite gas discoveries, for which Reliance has been struggling to piece together a viable development plan. While the Europe's second biggest oil firm will pay USD 7.2 billion in three tranches in FY12, some analysts said Reliance will not be liable to any income tax on the receipts. The USD 7.2 billion deal is seen as the biggest FDI into India. Other proposed big transaction -- Posco's USD 12 billion investment announced years ago for a steel plant in Orissa -- is yet to take off. Reliance is the operator in all the 23 blocks while Canadian Niko Resources and UK's Hardy Oil have minority 10% interest in a few. After the deal, Reliance holding in the blocks will come down to 60-70%. 19 out of 23 blocks lie off the east coast while two blocks are onland in Assam and Gujarat. Reliance currently produces about 47.5 mmscmd of natural gas from its mainstay KG-D6 fields off the Andhra coast. Niko Resources of Canada has 10% interest in the block and after the BP deal, Reliance's stake would fall to 60%. Besides KG-D6, Reliance's second biggest discovery block is NEC-25 in the Mahanadi basis off the Orissa coast. It has so far made 15 exploratory success in the block, where Niko holds 10% stake. Post BP deal, Reliance stake in thisblock too will fall to 60%. Reliance has potential resource of 9.5 Tcf in KG-D3 block. Hardy has 10% in the block and Reliance 90%.  Besides, it has made oil discoveries in Cambay onland block. In KG-D6 block, Reliance has so far made 19 oil and gas discoveries, of which it has put two gas - Dhirubhai-1 and 3, and one oil find - MA - into production. It had in 2008 submitted development plan for nine satellite gas discoveries around Dhirubhai-1 and 3. It in 2009 withdrew this and submitted an optimised development plan for prioritising four satellite gas finds to oil regulator DGH. An integrated development plan for all gas discoveries in the block KG-D6 is being conceptualised to maximise capital efficiency and accelerate monetisation. The BP deal is a clear breakthrough for Mukesh Ambani, 53, in terms of getting access to BP's expertise as well as de-risking its exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) portfolio. Reliance and BP will also form a 50:50 joint venture for the sourcing and marketing of gas in India. The JV will also work towards creation of infrastructure for receiving, transporting and marketing of natural gas in India which could be in the form of an LNG terminal. BP acquires 30% stake in 23 of the 29 blocks that Reliance has in India (excluding the older Panna/Mukta and Tapti (PMT) fields and the domestic coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks). It will take stake in 19 blocks (18 deepwater and 1 shallow water) in the eastern offshore. This include the deepwater KG-D6 and NEC-25 blocks, in which commercial discoveries have been made; 2 deep water Kerala-Konkan blocksand 2 onland blocks including the Cambay blocks in which Reliance has made several oil discoveries. Reliance was awarded a total of 43 blocks to date from the pre-NELP and eight NELP rounds. 14 of these blocks have been relinquished by 1QFY11. Out of the 29 blocks remaining, there have been discoveries in nine blocks. The firm names its discoveries in numerical order. The first was called D1 (after its founder Dhirubhai Ambani) and 52 discoveries have been made to date. Of these, four have been made in the overseas Yemen block (which is producingsmall quantities) and one in a block that has since been relinquished. So, 47 discoveries have been made in nine NELP blocks. 19 of these discoveries related to KG-D6. New deepwater gas discoveries will be expensive to develop relative to the D1/D3 field reserves within KG-D6, which are already producing. Hence, new discoveries would need a higher gas price than is currently being charged for the D6 gas (USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit). Reliance also has 30% interest in the producing pre-NELP blocks PMT. It also has 5 CBM blocks in India including two, with gas resource of 3.5 Tcf. Reliance has also recently formed three US Shale gas JVs. BP will not take interest in any of these E&amp;amp;amp;P assets of Reliance. Reliance is the largest integrated oil and gas company in India. Its three main business are exploration and production, refining and petrochemicals. Its two refineries in Jamnagar, Gujarat have among the highest complexity globally and a combined capacity of 1 million barrels per day."

BP had in February announced buying 30% stake in 23 blocks of Reliance, including prolific KG Basin block D6 and gas discovery block NEC-25. While Reliance made an application for transfer of interest on February 25, Oil Ministry earlier this month sent the proposal to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for approval. Sources said law ministry in its comments on Cabinet note raised the issue of the two blocks, where the Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH) and Reliance are in disagreement over exploration status. In NEC-DWN-2002/1, Reliance had taken an extension of Phase-I of its exploration campaign. In the meanwhile, the government recently announced rig moratorium, allowing firm more time to fulfill their drilling commitments which they had previously not met due to global shortage of drilling rigs. Since NEC-DWN-2002/1 was covered by rig moratorium, Reliance sought to withdraw the exploration extension it had availed as per the exploration extension policy of the government but DGH and oil ministry said no to it, sources said adding it is not clear if the block in now under Phase-1 or Phase-II of the exploration phase. In Assam block AS-ONN-2000/1, there is disagreement if Reliance had completed its Phase-I work programme and entered Phase-II. While Reliance had drilled a well on NEC-DWN-2002/1, it was planning to do so on Assam block shortly. The well on NEC-DWN-2002/1 was dry i.e. did not lead to any oil or gas find. Sources said finance ministry has opined that approval to the Reliance-BP deal may be given unconditionally while the comments of the Home Ministry are awaited. If Home Ministry responds by Monday, the oil ministry will the following day send a detailed cabinet note complying view of ministries of finance, law and home. The deal may then come up for deliberation of the CCEA on July 21, they said. Home Ministry had previously given a security clearance to the USD 7.2 billion deal. Sources said the two blocks on which CCEA may give some kind of a conditional approval, are inconsequential in the whole transaction as there has not been any hydrocarbon discovery so far."

This is by incorporating new inputs like the one done by Reliance for its KG-D6 fields where cost went up from USD 2.4 billion initially proposed to USD 8.8 billion in two phases (USD 5.2 billion in Phase-1 and USD 3.6 billion in phase-II). The initial cost produced in 2004 was for producing a maximum of 40 million standard cubic meters per day but in the revised plans, Reliance doubled output to 80 mmscmd. &amp;quot;Financial estimates were best estimates at that point of time for the broad work programme considered in development plan and were used for techno economic evaluation only,&amp;quot; DGH said. CAG in the draft report had accused oil ministry and DGH of turning a blind eye to the cost increase which would lower government's profit take from the field. Sources said DGH disagreed with CAG assumption of adverse impact on government's financial take from the project saying &amp;quot;cost for the purpose of computation of government take is determined based on actual expenditure incurred and duly validated by audit, and is not based on development plan estimates&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Any expenditure qualified by audit will be disallowed as contract cost,&amp;quot; it said adding Reliance's actual expenditure on Phase-1 of KG-D6 gas field development is USD 5.6 billion till March 2011. Second phase of drilling is scheduled to commence shortly. A Reliance team headed by its Executive Director PMS Prasad pointed that &amp;quot;the draft CAG report had found nothing to suggest that Reliance indulged in gold-plating viz that Reliance placed orders on its own affiliates at inflated costs or that payments made to vendors came back to Reliance&amp;quot;. Sources said Reliance stated that &amp;quot;using the benefit of hindsight, CAG cannot question the technical and operational judgements of the operator that were in effect the best possible judgements at that time based on the best information available. Benchmarking the project with similar ones the world over validates the fact that KG-D6 remains the most cost effective project.&amp;quot; Reliance said there was &amp;quot;no malafide intent&amp;quot; on its part in making any &amp;quot;economic, commercial or operational decisions&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Reasonableness of costs incurred cannot be established on the basis of hindsight. Any increase in the investment only increases the risk exposure of the operator without giving any additional benefits,&amp;quot; it added. The company presented nearly 250 page reply to the CAG draft audit while DGH put up another 180 pages to support its decisions which it described as in the interest of the country and the companies.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  Sources said the private operators criticised CAG for exceeding its brief and converting the Special Audit into a Performance Audit. Any audit has to be done under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) which provides for the legal regime under which the companies have to operate.  If audits like that done by CAG were to go beyond the PSC, there would be no legal protection left for the companies, they said. Sources said Reliance took almost 100 minutes to explain its point while Cairn did it n less than 30 minutes. BG took an equal amount of time. CAG in its June 7 draft report stated that the oil ministry and its technical arm DGH favoured private firms like Reliance and Cairn India by allowing them to retain entire exploration acreage, turning a blind eye to increase in&amp;amp;nbsp; capital expenditure and giving additional area in violation of Production Sharing Contract (PSC). Sources said DGH urged CAG to focus in its final report on accounting issues with quantification so as to ensure that revenue and expenditure reported in the books of accounts reflect a true and fair view in line with the accounting principles. Also, procurement of goods and services should be viewed in the light of the common commercial practices prevailing in the private sector, that distinguishes the performance of private sector and may not be unduly shadowed by the systems and procedures of PSU, it said. On pure technical issues, the CAG audit should rely on the judgement of the technical arm of the oil ministry for drawing conclusions in view of the fact that exploration and production complexity is not easily comprehensible. &amp;quot;The CAG's final comment should encourage enhanced inflow of private and foreign capital and technology,&amp;quot; DGH stated. CAG may take two months to finalise its final report which would be tabled in Parliament."

Coal India Ltd (CIL) fell sharply on heavy sell-offs in metals and mining firms after the Centre cleared a draft bill proposing that they share profits with the people displaced by their projects or pay them royalty.  CIL valuation dipped Rs 13,927.58 crore to Rs 2,28,652.23 crore, pulling it down to the fourth position from the second after Reliance Industries as on July 1. ONGC sailed past TCS, which was at the third position, to capture the CIL spot in the overall ranking as of last Friday.  CIL was also the biggest loser among the country's top-10 firms. It tanked nearly 6% during the week to end at Rs 362. On Friday alone, the scrip plunged 8.12%.  Last week, a ministerial panel, headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee , approved the proposed Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Bill, 2011, according to which coal miners would have to share 26 per cent of their profits and non-coal miners will have to pay 100% royalty to the projects-affected people.  ONGC managed to regain the second spot after nearly two months. However, despite grabbing the coveted CIl position, ONGC saw a minor dip of Rs 85.55 crore from its m-cap, which stood at Rs 2,36,302.36 crore.  RIL continued to rule the chart despite shedding Rs 2,510.72 crore from its valuation, at Rs 2,79,740.81 crore.  IT major TCS, FMCG giant ITC and top private lender ICICI Bank were the other companies that saw m-cap losses.  TCS saw its valuation declining by Rs 2,906.44 crore to Rs 2,29,285.98 crore, while ITC lost Rs 1,122.03 crore from its m-cap which stood at Rs 1,54,955.45 crore. Similarly, ICICI's valuation declined by Rs 3,993.34 crore to Rs 1,22,120.48 crore.  In contrast, Infosys Technologies , SBI, NTPC and Bharti Airtel witnessed gains.  IT bellwether Infosys added Rs 2,503.42 crore to take its m-cap to Rs 1,70,985.06 crore, while country's biggest lender SBI saw its valuation swelling by Rs 3,654.37 crore to Rs 1,57,391.8 crore.  Power producer NTPC added Rs 3,215.73 crore, to reach Rs 1,56,581.29 crore m-cap, while Bharti's valuation surged by Rs 5,563.37 crore to Rs 1,51,179.27 crore.  Bharti last week unveiled major restructuring of its India and South Asia operations, combining various segments, including mobile and digital TV into two separate business units to improve efficiency.

Reliance Executive Director PMS Prasad on June 29 wrote to Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi protesting that his firm has not received the full copy of the draft CAG report and was never consulted on many issues pointed in the reports. &amp;quot;...the subject matter of many of the observations being reported does not seem to have constituted the substance of any of the audit memos we had received from the CAG team during the audit of KG-DWN-98/3 (or KG-D6) block at our premises between December 2009 to September 2010. &amp;quot;Needless to say neither were any of these issues raised by CAG during our brief conference with the CAG team on June 4,&amp;quot; he said in the letter. A spokesperson of CAG could not be reached for comments. CAG's June 7 draft report said the oil ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, favoured Reliance by turning a blind eye to the Mukesh Ambani firm increasing capital expenditure on its flagship KG-D6 gas fields and allowed it to retain entire exploration acreage in violation of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs). &amp;quot;All observations that are of material consequence to us as a contractor, and affect our rights as well as obligations under the PSC, need to be responded to by us in the interest of fair play and natural justice, particularly in relation tothose observations in respect of which no memo was received by us during audit, seeking our comments,&amp;quot; Prasad wrote. Oil Ministry too had in a June 22 letter to CAG raised the issue of CAG not seeking comments from private firms like Reliance and Cairn India before before levying a series of allegations. &amp;quot;In the interactive meeting (CAG had with firms before submitting the draft report) one of the operators gave a presentation on how the project was executed and no audit observations were discussed. In the other meeting, only one observation was discussed with the operator,&amp;quot; it wrote. &amp;quot;The operators were not given any draft report before this meeting so that they could have come prepared with some reply,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote. Prasad in the June 29 letter stressed that the process of giving contractors an opportunity to respond to any audit objection before preparation of the draft report was not followed. The Oil Ministry asked the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to now give the private operators a chance to present their views. &amp;quot;The contractors have seen and replied to the audit requisitions and memos only. They have not been given the draft report, which has the response to audit queries and observation of the CAG,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote. The ministry cited provisions of the PSC signed with firms like Reliance to state that seeking comments on audit observations was a must. &amp;quot;Any audit exception shall (have to) be made available by the government in writing to the contractor within 120 days following completion of the audit in question and thereafter, the contractor shall answer within 120 days of receipt of such notice,&amp;quot; it wrote. Prasad said it &amp;quot;would be against the rules of natural justice if observations on issues on which we have not been heard are retained in the report without giving us sufficient opportunity to present the facts of the case.&amp;quot; Reliance sought &amp;quot;suitable opportunity&amp;quot; of being heard on the issues and till such time &amp;quot;references to issues on which we have not been accorded an opportunity of being heard may kindly be withheld.&amp;quot; In the draft report, the CAG said rules were bent, enabling Reliance to retain the entire 7,645-square kilometre KG-D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, off the East Coast. Also, the development plan Reliance submitted for Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, was not in compliance with the PSC and the ministry and the DGH turned a blind eye to the company raising capital expenditure without having begun work on the previous plan. Reliance had in May, 2004, proposed an investment of USD 2.4 billion for producing 40 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the D1 and D3 fields and later, in October, 2006, moved an addendum to this saying USD 5.2 billion would be required in Phase-1 to produce 80 mmscmd of gas and another USD 3.3 billion to sustain the peak output for a longer duration. The CAG, however, did not say Reliance overbilled the government or caused a loss to the exchequer with the increase in development cost. &amp;quot;The increase in cost from Initial Development Plan (IDP) to Addendum to IDP is likely to have significant adverse impact on government of India's financial take. However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unableto comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise, of the increase in cost from IDP to AIDP, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; it said."

Harrisons Malayalam, which is also a major tea grower, is joining a surge in outbound investment by corporate India. It plans to spend up to USD 112 million somewhere in Africa to buy about 10,000 acres. The overseas investment push by Indian companies, often seen as the assertiveness of a rising power, is increasingly spurred by difficulty finding attractive opportunities in Asia's third-largest economy. &amp;quot;Plantation land in India is very scarce and the competition is intense for the little that is available,&amp;quot; said Harrisons Malayalam Managing Director Pankaj Kapoor. &amp;quot;So all the plantation companies are looking at Africa where it is still available and cheap.&amp;quot; At home, rising interest rates and inflation, fierce competition in several industries, and policy gridlock amid a spate of corruption scandals that have put India's government on the defensive have deterred investment, slowing economic growth and prompting many Indian firms to seek opportunity elsewhere. While doing business abroad diversifies risk and opens new markets, the export of capital even as inflows slow deprives the Indian economy of investment that could add capacity and ease bottlenecks that drive inflation and crimp growth.   Inorganic growth India Inc.'s increasingly global focus also makes it harder for equity investors to gain exposure directly to the country's consumption-driven growth, with roughly one-third to half of revenue generated by firms in the 50-share Nifty index coming from overseas, even though exports account for just 18% of India's economy. &amp;quot;Despite India's vast opportunities across under-penetrated sectors, companies are venturing abroad for inorganic growth,&amp;quot; HDFC Securities analyst Anupam Gupta wrote in a recent report. &amp;quot;While this is also partly driven by rising global aspirations for Indian companies, another reason for this is a tough competitive field, made no easier by the unpredictable regulatory environment,&amp;quot; he wrote. Foreign direct investment (FDI) by Indian firms more than doubled in the fiscal year that ended in March to USD 44 billion. At the same time, inbound FDI fell by a quarter to USD 19.4 billion, with planned multibillion-dollar investments by South Korean steelmaker POSCO and London-listed India-focused miner Vedanta Resources plagued by delays. Within India, investment was flat on an annual basis in January-March after growing 7.8% in the previous quarter. Indian firms have made several big-ticket overseas buys in recent years, and the huge Reliance Industries and Tata conglomerates earn more than half their revenue abroad. However, the recent mismatch in inbound and outbound investment suggests push factors are increasingly at play. &amp;quot;To a certain extent there is a perception within the private sector of policy drift domestically,&amp;quot; said Frank Hancock, managing director for advisory at Barclays in India. &amp;quot;As a result some corporates are factoring in a higher degree of political risk for making investments at home than abroad,&amp;quot; said Hancock, who advised Indian mobile giant Bharti Airtel in its USD 9 billion purchase last year of most of Kuwait-based Zain's African operations.   Opportunity and frustration With an economy growing around 8% a year, 1.2 billion people and unmet demand for everything from housing, roads and power to food and consumer goods, India is hungry for capital. Conditions on the ground, however, can make it hard to put money to work. The fast-growing telecoms sector is beset by uncertainty stemming from a massive licensing scandal that has seen several executives held in jail and put the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the back foot over its handling of corruption. Already, telecom was ferociously competitive. &amp;quot;What does Bharti's move into Africa tell you? It tells you that the Indian market is saturated probably,&amp;quot; said David Cornell, Mumbai-based director at fund manager India Advisory Partners (IAP), which targets domestically-focused Indian firms. Securing land for big projects is fraught with problems. Mining and power companies can't dig the coal and other raw materials they need because of a slowdown in environmental clearances, sending them in search of resources in Australia, Indonesia and elsewhere. Even state-run Coal India, the world's biggest coal miner, missed production targets, in part because tighter environmental rules kept it from gaining access to new domestic mines, adding urgency to its hunt for mining assets abroad. In some cases, companies have permits but can't start mining. Indian home and personal care goods makers Godrej Consumer Products, Dabur India Ltd and Marico are searching for buys in Africa amid fierce competition inside India. Even with a severe infrastructure deficit at home, Indian builders of roads and power plants are active overseas. Hyderabad-based GVK Power &amp;amp;amp; Infrastructure Ltd in January signed a memorandum of understanding to invest USD 3 billion to USD 5 billion to build airports on the Indonesian islands of Bali and Java. For India's infrastructure builders, &amp;quot;the fact that they're looking for opportunities overseas highlights the policy paralysis that exists here,&amp;quot; said IAP's Cornell.  Sentiment setback India's economy grew at a 7.8% annual pace in January-March, its slowest in five quarters and well below forecasts. The central bank has raised interest rates 10 times since March 2010, which has taken a toll on sentiment among companies and investors. Mumbai stocks are among the world's worst performers this year, with the Sensex down more than 8%. Foreign portfolio investors have put a net USD 494 million into Indian stocks in 2011, well off the record pace of last year, which ended with USD 29.3 billion in net fund inflows. Few question India's attractiveness as a long-term bet. Local auto makers Maruti Suzuki and Hero Honda Motors and global giants like Ford and Hyundai Motor are adding capacity in an Indian car market that grew 30% in the fiscal year that ended in March. Near-term sentiment is weaker. Three-quarters of leading firms have lost faith in the government and believe a governance crisis and policy limbo will hit economic growth and their investment plans, a recent survey found.  Saurabh Mukherjea, head of equities at Ambit Capital in Mumbai, said rising domestic competition is a bigger driver of outbound investment than policy gridlock, which combined with inflation is more of a deterrent for foreign investors. &amp;quot;I think our reputation as a country to put money in has taken a knock because of the state of our governance -- I don't think there is any two ways about it,&amp;quot; Mukherjea said. More importantly, he said, governance issues and the policy gridlock are hitting economic growth, which is &amp;quot;softening quite meaningfully at the moment.&amp;quot;"

Although the Oil Ministry has the authority to decide on Reliance selling 30% interest to BP in 23 exploration blocks, including the prize eastern offshore KG-D6 gas fields, the ministry yesterday decided to refer the deal to the CCEA, sources privy to the development said. The USD 7.2 billion deal is the single largest foreign direct investment in the country and Reliance had on February 25 made a formal application to the Oil Ministry for approval of the transfer of stake to Europe's second biggest oil company.&amp;amp;nbsp;Sources said the decision to refer the deal to CCEA, which is likely to delay approval for the deal, came more than a month after the Ministry of Home Affairs gave security clearance to the BP stake acquisition. Presently, 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) is permitted in the oil and gas exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) sector under the automatic route (without going through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board or CCEA). Sources said while security agencies' no-objection certificate for the Reliance-BP deal was unconditional, the Home Ministry's one-page note had flagged a couple of issues.  The Ministry had wanted to know if the New Exploration Licencing Policy (NELP), under which Reliance won blocks like KG-D6, provided for the sale of interest and if BP could take oil and gas produced from the area outside the country, as per the extant rules. NELP provides for the farm-out of interest and several firms have done so in the past, including Cairn India, which sold 90% stake in the KG-DWN-98/2 block adjacent to the KG-D6 fields to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in 2005, sources said, adding that export of oil is not permitted under Indian law. For natural gas, operators like Reliance don't have marketing freedom and it is the government which fixes not just the price and quantity, but also the buyers of the fuel. With such stringent laws, it is not possible for BP to take oil and gas produced from Reliance blocks outside, theysaid. The Home Ministry had also asked if Reliance could not have offered the stake to state-owned gas utility GAIL India or any other PSU. But none of the state firms, least of all gas trading firm GAIL, has the deepsea technology that Reliance is looking for to develop difficult to exploit hydrocarbon reserves. Also, the Home Ministry assertion that the Reliance-BP gas trading venture would erode GAIL's share ran against the government policy of inviting private sector competition and is contrary to the spirit of a free market economy, sources said. Reliance wants to leverage the worldwide experience of BP to resolve sub-surface technical issues at its KG-D6 gas fields, where production has fallen from 61.5 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) to about 48 mmscmd, instead of rising to the planned 69 mmscmd. The Mukesh Ambani-led firm hopes BP will be able to fix reservoir issues at the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block to rapidly raise output to the planned peak of 80 mmscmd and also to help formulate viable plans to bring other finds in the block and in other areas on to production. BP already operates oil and gas blocks in the country and has a huge lubricant business, besides a flourishing solar venture with Tata, and as such did not need security clearance, sources said. ONGC, the nation's largest state explorer, is in fact struggling to put together a viable development plan for discoveries it has made in a block adjacent to KG-D6 in the Krishna-Godavari basin.  ONGC itself has been seeking partners for that block and had shortlisted BP as a potential ally. BP will pay USD 7.2 billion for a 30% stake in 23 out of 26 exploration blocks held by Reliance and aperformance payment of up to USD 1.8 billion if the tie-up leads to the development of commercial discoveries. Reliance and BP will also form an equal joint venture for the import, marketing and transportation of natural gas. Sources said after the CCEA nod, amendments to the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) of the 23 blocks would be effected to induct BP as a partner. Reliance will retain operatorship of all 23 blocks. &amp;quot;The BP-Reliance move to form a joint venture for transporting and marketing natural gas in India is widely expected to spell trouble for public sector gas major GAIL,&amp;quot; the Home Ministry's June 1 letter said. Stating that GAIL, ONGC and Oil India had to foot Rs25,200 crore out of the Rs 75,600 crore retailers lost on selling fuel below cost, it said, &amp;quot;Oil PSUs' share in the marketing of natural gas would take a big hit if the BP-Reliance duo enters the segment in a big way, which it is expected to do so.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Thirty percent stake in Reliance's gas and oil assets could have been offered to GAIL or any other PSU which could have raised the USD 7.2 billion as a consortium,&amp;quot; it added.  Also, the ministry said it needs to be &amp;quot;ascertained whether the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) agreement/contract under which Reliance bought the oil wells had a provision for the sale of assets and whether the Reliance-BP deal would enable BP to sell/transport gas outside the country.&amp;quot; The Oil Ministry official said NELP provides for farm-outs or stake sales and Reliance's agreement with BP was in perfect conformity with that."

Sources in the agency said that the CBI had approached an expert for making a detailed analysis who sought a fee of over Rs 20 lakh following which it decided to write to the Petroleum Ministry. &amp;quot;We will be writing to the Petroleum Ministry for hiring the same expert for us as the agency cannot make such a huge payment,&amp;quot; a senior CBI official said. A Preliminary Enquiry into the case was registered in November 2009 on request of Petroleum Ministry following several objections raised by the anti-corruption watch dog -- CVC -- on the KG-D6 fields deal. The Central Vigilance Commission had forwarded a complaint in which it was alleged that there was a phenomenal increase in capital expenditure from USD 2.4 billion to about USD 8.8 billion in the project. Besides, the CBI may also seek help to understand why DGH allowed Reliance to retain to entire KG-D6 block in contravention of the policy that stipulates relinquishing 25% of the area every year. Reliance Industries is the operator of block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 in the Krishna Godavari (KG) Basin off the Andhra Pradesh coast. It holds 90% stake in the block while Canada's Niko Resources has the remaining 10%. In a draft audit report on KG-D6, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) allowed Reliance to hike capital expenditure for developing Dhirubhai-1 and 3, the largest of 18 gas finds in the block, by 117%. &amp;quot;The increase in cost from (USD 2.39 billion in the) Initial Development Plan to (USD 5.196 billion) in the Addendum to the Initial Development Plan is likely to have a significant impact on the government of India's financial take. &amp;quot;However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unable to comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise, of the increase in cost, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; the CAG said in a draft report sent to the Oil Ministry for comments. An operator like Reliance is allowed to recover all capital cost on developing a field from revenues earned from the sale of oil or gas before profits are split between the stakeholders, including the government. Reliance had, however, said, &amp;quot;As a responsible operator, it has fully complied with the requirements in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) at all times in conducting petroleum operations, and refutes any suggestion to the contrary. &amp;quot;The KG-D6 project... has been globally acclaimed for its cost effective, speedy, flawless execution and smooth commissioning,&amp;quot; Reliance had said in a statement."

The cumulative market capitalisation of all the listed companies of Ratan Tata-led salt-to-software conglomerate today rose to Rs 4,47,351 crore, based on their share prices at the Bombay Stock Exchange. Taking into account today's RBI reference rate for one US dollar at Rs 44.5855, this translates into total market valuation of USD 100.33 billion for the Tata group.&amp;amp;nbsp;The group's total market value stood at Rs 446,420 crore(USD 99.8 billion) yesterday. The Tata group comprises of nearly 100 operating companies, but only about 30 of them are listed in the stock market. These include TCS, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power, Indian Hotels, Titan, Voltas and Tata Communications. TCS alone accounts for more than half of the group's total market value with a market capitalisation of USD 52 billion (Rs 232,194 crore). In an overall weak stock market today, when benchmark Sensex fell by 83 points, some of the Tata group companies managed to add value to their stocks. These included Rallis, Indian Hotels, Tata Communications, Tata Global Beverages, Tata Investment Corp, Trent and TCS. Tata group crossing the USD 100-billion dollar mark of market valuation today, coincided with TCS's Annual General Meeting.&amp;amp;nbsp;Incidentally, Tatas had crossed Rs 1,00,000 crore market value mark with TCS's listing on August 25, 2004, becoming the country's most valued business house at that time. Also, earlier in January this year, the Tata group's market value had briefly crossed USD 100-billion mark, but a subsequent fall in the market brought down their valuation.  Way back in September 2007, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries group had become the first business house in the country to attain a market cap of USD 100 billion.&amp;amp;nbsp;About month later, RIL alone had attained a market cap of USD 100 billion on October 18, 2007, but a high rupee valuation was also a key factor at that time. RIL's market cap at that time had risen to Rs 4,07,748 crore, which was equivalent to USD 103 billion dollars at that time's forex rates. At the end of today's market, RIL had a market value of Rs 2,82,217 crore, while its group valuation, after taking into account another listed company, RIIL (rpt) RIIL was Rs 283,014 crore (USD 63.5 billion).&amp;amp;nbsp;RIL shares today fell by about 4%, thus becoming a major drag for the benchmark Sensex. The Mukesh Ambani-led group is currently the country's second most valued business house after Tatas, which is a reversal of position from a year ago. As on June 30, 2010, Tatas were second most valued with market cap of Rs 326,827 crore, after Mukesh-led Reliance group's Rs 357,902 crore. On stand-alone basis, Reliance Industries continues to remain the country's most value company, followed by Coal India, ONGC, TCS and Infosys. Within Tata group, TCS is the most valued firm with a market cap of Rs 231,194 crore, followed by Tata Steel (Rs 57,744 crore), Tata Motors (Rs 53,528 crore), Tata Power (Rs 31,023 crore) and Titan (Rs 18,954 crore). A number of Tata group stocks, such as Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Tata Tele, Titan and Voltas lost value today, but gains in others like TCS, Tata Communications and Trent helped the group attain a market cap of over USD 100 billion.&amp;amp;nbsp;Earlier in April this year, a brokerage report had said that TCS alone was on its way to double its market cap to over USD 100 billion in another four years.

Remember these are midcap ideas not just for the day, but stocks that look attractive in the medium-term as well.  This week, Rajesh Agarwal of Eastern Financiers, Ashish Tatter from Fort Share Broking and VVLN Sastry of Firstcall India equity battle it out for top honours.  Below are their top stock picks for the day: Rajesh Agarwal of Eastern Financiers We recommed buying Hanung Toys. One can buy this stock at a stoploss of Rs 132 and target of Rs 162. The reason why we like this stock is the extremely cheap valuation. The stock has seen real battering in the last few trading sessions and has gone down to quite a reasonable valuation. Trading at the price to book value of 0.6 and and PE of 3.5, we expect the company to report the EPS of around Rs 40 for the coming year. I like Bata India. One can buy this stock with a stoploss of Rs 535 and target of Rs 630. Bata is a player in footwear industry. The full year results ended December 2010 were pretty good. The company has a large number of stores - around 1200 stores and it deals with around 30,000 dealers. The products are sold through 30,000 dealers. Bata has a strong brand positioning and they are trying to convert themselves from a brand of low value to higher value products. Third stock which we like is Talwalkars. This company is into fitness business, having around 100 healthclubs in 30 towns. The company has recently taken a strategy of eying Tier 3 &amp;amp;amp; Tier 4 cities where population is around 5 lakh and this strategy is going to do well considering the fact that the disposable income in the hands of our Indians have gone up considerably. So I think this can be a good buy even for a long term but for intraday one can buy the stock with a stoploss of Rs 240 and a target of Rs 260. We have a sell call on BPCL. This can be sold with a stoploss of Rs 655 and a target of Rs 626. The kind of run up which we have seen in the last few days due to the announcement of price hikes and all, although we are very bullish on oil marketing companies and recommend buying for a longer term but considering the fact that it has run up quite a lot we feel that some amount of correction is due. We think this will correct in the very short term. Aashish Tater, Fort Share Broking The first stock for the day is Liberty Shoes. We feel this stock has been ignored by the markets - the way Bata has been rallying I think Liberty has got quite ample scope to catch up from current levels. I have an intraday target of Rs 109 on to the stock and we have a medium term target of close to Rs 122 on the stock. The second stock for the day is Premier. I had been bullish for quite some time with a medium term target of Rs 180. I am plyaing with this stock with an intraday target of Rs 97. I feel this stock has tremendous potential and we feel the market cap and enterprise value at around Rs 440 odd mark with potential of recovering almost Rs 600 crore from its additional landbank in the Dombivali area. We feel this is a potential candidate for a long term bet and we feel that this stock can easily achieve Rs 150-160 in days to come with the announcement and the deal going through. The third stock for the day is technical call. We would like to buy Hanung Toys for an intraday target of Rs 149.50. The stock has shown good bounce back from it's lower levels.

Local oil product sales, a proxy for domestic oil demand in Asia's third-largest oil consumer, rose to 12.93 million tonne in May, the government data showed, driven by diesel sales as dealers topped up tanks expecting a price increase. In April, India's oil product demand rose an annual 4.2%. India finally raised diesel and kitchen fuel prices last week at a ministerial panel meeting which was initially expected to take place on May 11. Diesel sales, which make up over a third of refined products consumption, quickened to an annual 10.9% rise in May, the highest gain in a year, as many factories and power plants switched to the cheaper and cleaner fuel, leading to a 23.1% decline in furnace oil consumption. Gasoline sales in May rose an annual 8% versus 7.4% in April. But gasoline sales in June could ease reflecting moderating car sales, hardening interest rates and a price increase for the product.  While India should keep expanding at rates many nations would envy, Asia's third-largest economy faces a period of reduced growth and stubbornly high inflation. India's industrial output growth slowed in April, the latest sign that the rising cost of credit and inflation are acting as brakes on the economy. Indian state-run firms in mid-May raised petrol prices by about 8.6% or Rs 5 a litre.  India's crude imports rose 1.8% to 13.63 million tonne or about 3.22 million barrels per day (bpd) in May. The data for May includes estimated imports and exports for Reliance Industries's export-focused 580,000 bpd refinery at Jamnagar, in western India. Diesel exports rose 29.1% in May, while petrol exports were up 13.1% from a year ago. Oil products imports declined 38.6% while exports rose 30.5% from a year ago."

The auditor said that in the case of performance audit on hydrocarbon production sharing contracts, &amp;quot;interactive meetings were held with two operators, including RIL, prior to the finalisation of the draft performance audit report&amp;quot;. However, in a letter dated June 22, the Petroleum Ministry said the CAG&amp;amp;nbsp; did not mention its observations or seek comments of the private firms on its audit objections during the&amp;amp;nbsp; interactive meetings it had with RIL and Cairn days before finalising its draft report. Such non-disclosure was not not in line with the production sharing contract because of which government will not not be reverse any cost recovery or disallow any expenditure, the government letter said. The CAG said the performance audit follows a structured, systematic and objective architecture, which involves taking into account all relevant facts furnished by the concerned parties to ensure a balanced and objective reporting. The government auditor said that as per the audit methodology the draft report was forwarded to Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and 'Entry and Exit conferences' with the Oil Ministry as per the standard practice.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;It is for the ministry to take a view on what operator-specific points it needs to share, at this stage, with the operators,&amp;quot; the CAG said.  The CAG, in its June 8 draft report, stated that the Oil Ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), favoured Reliance and Cairn by allowing them to retain their entire exploration acreage, turning a blind eye to increases in capital expenditure and giving additional area in violation of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs).  In the draft report, the CAG said rules were bent, enabling Reliance to retain the entire 7,645 square kilometre KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6 block, in the Krishna Godavari Basin off the East Coast.&amp;amp;nbsp;Also, the development plan Reliance submitted for Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, was not in compliance with the PSC and the ministry and the DGH turned blind eye to the company raising capital expenditure without having begun work on the previous one."

While the CAG all through the audit of Reliance's KG-D6 gas field and Cairn's Rajasthan oilfields last year avoided meeting the companies, the auditor did not mention its observations or seek comments in interactive meetings it had days before finalising its draft report. &amp;quot;In the interactive meeting... one of the operators gave a presentation on how the project was executed and no audit observations were discussed. In the other meeting, only one observation was discussed with the operator,&amp;quot; the Oil Ministry wrote to the CAG on June 22. &amp;quot;The operators were not given any draft report before this meeting so that they could have come prepared with some reply,&amp;quot; it added. The CAG, in its June 8 draft report, said that the ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, favoured Reliance and Cairn by allowing them to retain their entire exploration acreage, turning a blind eye to increases in capital expenditure and giving additional area in violation of the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs). The Oil Ministry asked the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to now give the private operators a chance to present their views, but the nation's top auditor turned down the request. &amp;quot;The contractors have seen and replied to the audit requisitions and memos only. They have not been given the draft report which has the response to audit queries and observation of CAG,&amp;quot; the ministry wrote on June 22. &amp;quot;Relevant extracts of the draft report have to be given to the concerned operators for a proper reply; Ministry of Petroleum and Natural gas has initiated this process.&amp;quot; The CAG on the same day replied back saying its &amp;quot;audit mandate, scope and coverage&amp;quot; did not provide for seeking a response on its draft observations and the government can raise audit objections after it has finalised its report. Within days of the early June meetings with Reliance and Cairn, the only formal interaction the CAG had with them, the auditor sent its draft report to the ministry for comments. The ministry cited provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) signed with Reliance and Cairn to state that seeking comments on audit observations was a must. &amp;quot;Any audit exception shall (have to) be made available by the government in writing to the contractor within 120 days following completion of the audit in question and thereafter, the contractor shall answer within 120 days of receipt of such notice,&amp;quot; it wrote. &amp;quot;Thus, if the audit exceptions are not notified, any reversal of cost recovery/disallowance of any expenditure (based on audit exception) will not be feasible from the operator. This could also lead to disputes and the operator may choose to initiate an arbitration also,&amp;quot; the Oil Ministry said. The CAG took almost a year since completion of the audit in June last year to prepare the draft report. But now it is not giving the operators a few weeks to respond as per the principle of natural justice, sources said. The CAG wants an exit conference with the ministry to be held in the first week of July to conclude its final report. In the draft report, the CAG said rules were bent, enabling Reliance to&amp;amp;nbsp;retain the entire 7,645-square kilometre KG-DWN-98/3, or KG-D6 block, in the Krishna-Godavari Basin off the East Coast. Also, the development plan Reliance submitted for Dhirubhai-1 and 3, two of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, was not in compliance with the PSC and the ministry and the DGH turned blind eye to the company raising capital expenditure without having begun work on the previous one. Reliance had in May, 2004, proposed an investment of USD 2.4 billion for producing 40 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the D1 and D3 fields and later, in October, 2006, moved an addendum to this saying USD 5.2 billion would be required in Phase-1 to produce 80 mmscmd of gas and another USD 3.3 billion to sustain the peak output for a longerduration. The CAG, however, did not say Reliance overbilled the government or caused a loss to the exchequer with the increase in development cost. &amp;quot;The increase in cost from Initial Development Plan (IDP) to Addendum to IDP is likely to have significant adverse impact on government of India's financial take. However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unable to comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise, of theincrease in cost from IDP to AIDP, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; it said. The CAG stated that the Oil Ministry and DGH &amp;quot;irregularly allowed the operator (Reliance) to enter successive exploration phases without the stipulate relinquishment of area and then allowed the operator to declare the entire contract area as a 'discovery area', thus avoiding any relinquishment whatsoever.&amp;quot; On the Cairn India-operated Rajasthan oil fields, it said the grant of an additional area of 1,708.20 square kilometres beyond the contract area by the government was not in line with the provisions of the PSC, adversely affecting the sacrosanct nature of the contract area and its phased relinquishment."

Cairn India, which had made four discoveries in the KG-DWN-98/2 block before selling 90% out of its 100% stake in the block to ONGC in 2005, has written to the oil regulator DGH saying the state-owned firm is grossly overstating the reserves in block, sources said. CCEA may mull giving nod to Cairn-Vedanta deal this week It believes that &amp;quot;the hither-to discovered oil and gas resources in the block are only marginal to non-commercial, because of their small size and the potential high development costs due to water depth versus the prevailing gas prices.&amp;quot; ONGC estimates that the blocks holds an in-place volume of 25.61 million tonnes of oil and 197 billion cubic metres of natural gas. It is proposing an investment of over USD 7.3 billion to produce up to 30 million standard cubic metres per day of gas. The warning by Cairn, which holds a 10% interest in the acreage and is credited with finding oil in an area in Rajasthan where global giant Royal Dutch/Shell exited saying there was no hydrocarbons, is significant in view of the fall in gas output from Reliance's neighbouring KG-D6 block. Reliance had in 2007 estimated that the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields in the KG-D6 block would hit 69 mmscmd of output, but production has fallen to 40 mmscmd due to what the Mukesh Ambani-led firm says are reservoir complexities. Cairn, which is recognised the world-over for its expertise in assessment of hydrocarbon resources, wants &amp;quot;a correct reserve estimation of the block through an independent agency.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The work undertaken (to assess reserves in the block) by Schlumberger Data and Consulting Services in 2007 (at the behest of ONGC) is flawed and they substantially over-estimated the resources in the block,&amp;quot; it wrote to DGH. Stating that it had on various occasions pointed out to the flaws, Cairn said, &amp;quot;It is imperative that a new study is undertaken by a third party of repute which enjoys the confidence of both ONGC and Cairn, such as DeGolyer &amp;amp;amp; MacNaughton, in order to establish a correct assessment of the resources, based on which the stakeholders would be able to take appropriate decisions.&amp;quot; Cairn said ONGC had submitted a proposal to declare some of the discoveries in the block as commercial, a step toward developing the finds, without keeping it informed. ONGC, it said, was submitting various proposals without prior approval of the Operating Committee -- an oversight body comprising representatives of both partners. Submission of proposals without OC approval is a violation of the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement. Cairn claims that an innovative production method has to be worked out for the block in discussion with the DGH and the Oil Ministry. It also questioned the basis on which ONGC is seeking an extension of the appraisal period, which was completed as per the provisions of the PSC. It has asked for re-submission of the Declarations of Commerciality for the discoveries made in the block as well. ONGC bought 90% interest in Block KG-DWN-98/2 from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn still holds 10% in the block. Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area -- Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna). Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries -- E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1/KT-1 and the first ultra-deepwater discovery UD-1 at a record depth of 2,841 metres. The block is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U, A, while the ultra deepsea UD find lies in SDA. Even ONGC has acknowledged that the NDA discoveries are small to marginal and can not be developed on a standalone basis due to high deepwater development costs. Accordingly, it is proposing to develop the discoveries in an integrated cluster. Sources said the ONGC Declaration of Commerciality (DOC) of NDA on July 15, 2010, was submitted without OC approval and so was the DOC of SDA on December 21, 2009. The DGH, they said, wants a fresh proposal for DOC to be submitted by the operator after completion of the proposed appraisal drilling programme by July 16, 2013, in case of NDA and by December 22, 2012, in case of SDA, or by July 16, 2013, for both the NDA and SDA."

However, the Oil Ministry rejected the criticism saying&amp;amp;nbsp;the New Exploration Licencing Policy under which Reliance bagged the KG-D6 block was designed by the BJP-led NDA government in 1999 and the terms being deplored now are ones vetted and signed by the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. Reliance bagged the KG-DWN-98/3 block in the first round of NELP, which was pioneered by the NDA government, and signed the PSC for the block in 2000. &amp;quot;The Congress-led UPA government first came into power in May, 2004. You don't expect contracts signed by sovereign governments to be reneged just because a different party has come into power,&amp;quot; an official said. The PSCs provides for the operator to recover all capital and operating expenditure become the government's share of profit from a field rises to as high as 85%.&amp;amp;nbsp;This system gives &amp;quot;incentive to (an operator to) increase his investment, or front-end his work plan&amp;quot; in order to see that the threshold where government's profit take rises rapidly is not reached, the Chawla panel said in its report.&amp;amp;nbsp; Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy had yesterday indicated that the government will be open to accepting suggestions that can improve PSCs, but there are doubts if any chances in policy can be implemented with retrospective effect. At the heart of the PSC lies the 'investment multiple', the ratio of net cash income to exploration and development costs. The investment multiple defines the share of profits that go to the government. The higher the expenditure, thelower the IM and hence, the government's share of profit. Citing the example of KG-D6, the Chawla panel said, &amp;quot;The relationship between the pre-tax investment multiple (PTIM) and the share of contractor profit petroleum changes dramatically once the PTIM crosses 2.5, with the government's share increasing from 28% to 85%.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is useful to remember that this schedule is bid by the operator and not determined by the government,&amp;quot; it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;A high share of some PTIM will help to win the bid, depending on the financial model of evaluation used, but it does raise concerns that such a radical change would provide very strong incentives for any operator to adopt all investment and strategies possible to ensure that the PTIM stays within the 2.5 limit,&amp;quot; the panel report said. The CAG, in a draft report on its audit of the KG-D6 accounts, had also criticised the current PSC structure saying it was &amp;quot;unsuitable for protecting the government of India's financial interests.&amp;quot; The Chawla panel said the NELP model is not an outright upfront bid model (often called a bonus model). &amp;quot;Neither is it a standard royalty model as seen in mining systems, where revenue is shared regardless of profitability. Rather, it is a model that allows the operator to substantially recover his costs before the sharing of revenue,&amp;quot; it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;However, once these costs are recovered, the sharing with the government is often large.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Private contractors have virtually no incentive to minimise capital expenditure and a substantial incentive to increase capital expenditure so as to retain the PTIM in the lower slabs, which would result in low/lowest share of profit petroleum for the government of India,&amp;quot; the draft CAG report said. The auditor said the Oil Ministry and its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, &amp;quot;did not pay adequate attention to protecting the government's financial interest.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;The report has been sent to the ministry for its comments. The CAG was asked to audit KG-D6 after allegations of &amp;quot;gold-plating&amp;quot;, or artificially inflating costs, were levelled against Reliance, which increased the development cost of the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields in the KG-D6 block from USD 2.39 billion proposed in May, 2004, to USD 8.8 billion in 2006. The Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended a sliding scale of royalty payment linked to different oil and gas production quantities or values. &amp;quot;In our opinion, this is the best formula, given the current context, for harmonising the financial interests of both the government and private contractors.&amp;quot; However, it said if the Oil Ministry wished to retain the current PTIM model, it should allow prospectors to bid as per a fixed profit-sharing formula with a specified band.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;This will at least minimise the incentive for skewed capital expenditure resulting in very low government share of profit petroleum, although it will still require enormous efforts by the government to control cost recovery,&amp;quot; the CAG said."

The Prime Minister and the Union Cabinet must take full responsibility and order an inquiry into the matter,&amp;quot; CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury told reporters. Maintaining that they would raise the issue in Parliament, he said, &amp;quot;The Prime Minister is on record to say that India can ill-afford crony capitalism. But the worst form of crony capitalism is happening under his leadership.&amp;quot; There has been a raging controversy over the Comptroller and Auditor General''s draft report severely criticising Oil Ministry''s role in approving Reliance Industries'' KG-D6 &amp;quot;inflated&amp;quot; field costs. The Ministry has said no one should jump to conclusions as the report is yet to be finalised. &amp;quot;This is yet another example of crony capitalism, as we saw in the scams relating to 2G spectrum, Commonwealth Games and Adarsh society, where sweetheart deals are given to private companies, allowing them to make windfall profits&amp;quot;, he said. Yechury and another CPI(M) Rajya Sabha member Tapan Sen spoke of &amp;quot;another scam that is unfolding&amp;quot; from the report of CAG which audited the production sharing contracts and &amp;quot;exposed the nexus between the UPA government and the Reliance Industries&amp;quot;. They demanded immediate action against then Director General (Hydrocarbons) and other officials and sought delinking of gas prices from the international crude prices immediately. Sen said he had written seven letters since 2006 to then Petroleum Minister Murli Deora and thrice to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the contracts on KG basin gas with RIL. &amp;quot;There has been no concrete response as yet. But our stand has been vindicated by this draft CAG report,&amp;quot; he said. The CPI(M) leaders charged the then Director General and other officials with &amp;quot;colluding in this sordid affair&amp;quot;, causing loss to public exchequer and &amp;quot;unduly benefiting&amp;quot; RIL. &amp;quot;The price of KG basin gas should be revised on the basis of actual cost of production and a cost-plus formula,&amp;quot; they said. Yechury and Sen also sought immediate amendment in the present pricing formula in Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in consultation with the CAG. The two leaders released all the letters written to the Prime Minister and the Petroleum Minister since 2006 and now, as also copies of replies to questions raised in this regard in Parliament. Sen said the pricing exercise, approved by an Empowered Group of Ministers, only considered the price of 4.2 dollar per unit offered by RIL and &amp;quot;ignored the price offered by the same RIL to NTPC which was much lower at 2.4 dollars.&amp;quot; He also released a letter written by NTPC CMD to Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in 2007, saying the state-run power firm would suffer a whopping loss of Rs 24,000 crore in the contract period of 17 years due to the price differential between the gas price already being delivered at Kawas/Gandhar and RIL's proposed price."

The energy-to-retail conglomerate plans to utilise the fresh five-year term loan to refinance its existing higher interest rate debts, sources said. When contacted, a company spokesperson did not comment on the debt raising plans.  The banks hired for raising USD 1.1 billion of loans include SBI, Stanchart, Bank of America, RBS, HSBC, ANZ Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, DBS and Sumitomo Mitsui. Earlier this month, Chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani said at the company's AGM that RIL would become debt-free on net basis in the current financial year ending March 2012. RIL had an outstanding debt of Rs 67,397 crore (USD 15.1 billion) as of March 31, 2011, as against Rs 62,495 crore (USD 13.9 billion) a year ago. At the same time, RIL had cash and cash-equivalents of Rs 42,393 crore (USD 9.5 billion) as on March 31 this year, which was nearly double the level seen a year ago.  The company began a process last month to raise fresh loans worth about USD 1.5 billion. Out of this, loans worth about USD 1.1 billion are for repaying its existing loans maturing in next two years, while the company would also look at further USD 400-500 million of fresh borrowings from abroad.  Last year in October, RIL had raised USD 1.5 billion for the first time through bonds denominated in US dollars. While it raised USD one billion through 10-year bonds, another USD 500 million were arranged through sale of 30-year bonds. These funds were raised through RIL's wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance Holding USA Inc. This USD 1.5 billion bond sale was the company's first such bond issue after 13 years.  Besides, it was the largest ever public market offshore bond offering by RIL and largest ever corporate bond from India. This debt raising exercise was followed by plans to raise funds through sale of bonds in global markets by other Indian companies. These companies included the likes of Anil Ambani group firm Reliance Communications, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Essar Energy, JSW Steel and IDBI Bank."

The preparation of a detailed reply will take some time.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is only after taking into account the reply of Government that the Office of CAG will suitably amend the draft report and send the final report for placing it on the table of Parliament,&amp;quot; it added. The&amp;amp;nbsp;CAG in its draft report had alleged that the oil ministry and its technical arm DGH favoured Reliance but did not say if by doubling of cost of developing eastern offshore KG-D6 field the Mukesh Ambani firm had overbilled the government and thereby caused loss to the state exchequer. It also pulled up the ministry for going out of its way to grant nearly 1,700 sq km of additional area to Cairn India adjacent to its oil discovery in Rajasthan block. &amp;quot;As the process of preparation of reply and its vetting by the Office of CAG is yet to be completed, it would be premature for the Ministry to give any response on the observations made in the draft report at this stage,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;It would be equally incorrect for the media commentators, political leaders and civil rights activists to jump to conclusions and thus short-circuit the process,&amp;quot; the statement added. On receipt of ministry's reply, the Office of CAG will examine the reply on merits and will hold an exit conference with it before making its final observations. &amp;quot;The Ministry, therefore, appeals to all concerned to exercise restraint and allow the process to be completed,&amp;quot; the statement said. The Ministry said it was at its request in November 2007 that the Comptroller &amp;amp;amp; Auditor General of India agreed to carry out special audit in respect of certain blocks/fields operated under pre-New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and NELP regimes. &amp;quot;The draft Performance Audit Report has been received in this Ministry on June 8, 2011,&amp;quot; it added. &amp;quot;While the above process is underway, the leaked draft report is being reported and commented upon in sections of the media.&amp;quot; The CAG in its draft audit report on KG-D6 block said the ministry and DGH also bent the rules to grant &amp;quot;huge benefits&amp;quot; to Reliance when it was allowed to retain the entire block, but said gains cannot be quantified. &amp;quot;The increase in (Phase-1) cost from (USD 2.39 billion proposed in the) Initial Development Plan (of May 2004) to (USD 5.196 billion) in the addendum to the Initial Development Plan is likely to have a significant impact on the&amp;amp;nbsp; government of India's financial take. &amp;quot;However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unable to comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise of the increase in cost, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; CAG said in the draft report. Responding to the reports in media, Reliance earlier this week said that &amp;quot;as a responsible operator, it has fully complied with the requirements in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) at all times in conducting petroleum operations, and refutes any suggestion to the contrary&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The KG-D6 project.. has been globally acclaimed for its cost effective, speedy, flawless execution and smooth commissioning,&amp;quot; Reliance had said in a statement. Reliance had raised the cost of bringing to production India's first deep-sea and the largest gas field after reserves almost doubled to 11.3 trillion cubic feet, raising the peak output two times to 80 million cubic meters per day. An operator like Reliance is allowed to recover all the capital cost incurred on developing a field from revenues earned from the sale of oil or gas before profits are split between the stakeholders, including the government. The CAG conducted the audit of the Reliance accounts after allegations of 'gold-plating', or artificially inflating the development costs of Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields, two of the 18 discoveries in KG-D6 block, were levied by the AnilAmbani Group. The premier auditor, whose report will be tabled in Parliament after incorporating comments from the Oil Ministry, said Reliance never had the intention of developing KG-D6 gas fields as per the initial cost estimates and said it did not initiate tendering for equipment as per the original plan. CAG recommended that the &amp;quot;role of DGH and government of India representative on the Management Committee may be closely scrutinised to see why the operator was allowed to violate the provisions of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and not adhere strictly to the terms of the approved initial development plan&amp;quot;. On Cairns India, the CAG said as per the PSC, the total contract area of the company's operated RJ-ON-90/1 block' in Rajasthan was 11,108 sq km. The Oil Ministry agreed to Cairn's request for grant of additional 852.2 sq km in August 2004 and 856 sq km in March 2005. &amp;quot;In our view, the contract area under the PSC is sacrosanct... It can by no means be argued that already discovered reservoirs extend over the entire extended area of 852.20 sq km (and) 856 sq km,&amp;quot; it said."

The Ministry of Home Affairs wrote a one-page letter to the Petroleum Ministry on June 1 giving security clearance and a no-objection certificate for BP buying a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks of Reliance in India's largest foreign direct investment, a top Oil Ministry official said. While the NOC to the Reliance-BP deal is unconditional, the Home Ministry asked if Reliance could not have offered the stake to state-owned gas utility GAIL India or any other PSU. &amp;quot;Our PSUs do not have the expertise Reliance has been looking for. It wanted an expert in deepsea technology and GAIL, which is a gas marketing and transportation company, hardly fits the description,&amp;quot; he said. Reliance wants to leverage the worldwide experience of Europe's second biggest energy company to resolve sub-surface technical issues at its KG-D6 gas fields, where production has fallen from 61.5 million standard cubic metres per day to about 48 mmscmd, instead of rising to the planned 69 mmscmd. The Mukesh Ambani-led firm hopes BP would be able to fix reservoir issues at the Dhirubhai-1 and&amp;amp;nbsp;three gas fields in the KG-D6 block to rapidly raise output to the planned peak of 80 mmscmd and also help in formulating viable plans to bring to production other finds in the block and in other areas. Industry observers scoffed at the idea of Reliance first offering the stake to firms like GAIL and asked whether the Home Ministry would suggest the same to Cairn Energy, which is selling its Indian unit to London-listed mining group Vedanta Resources. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is already a 30% partner in Cairn India's mainstay Rajasthan block and could easily takeover Cairn Energy shares. They questioned the Oil Ministry's rationale of seeking security clearance for BP when the company is already operating oil and gas blocks in the country, has a huge lubricant business and a flourishing solar venture with Tata. ONGC, the nation's largest state explorer, is in fact struggling to put together a viable development plan for discoveries it has made in a block adjacent to KG-D6 in the Krishna-Godavari basin. ONGC itself has been seeking partnersfor that block and had shortlisted BP as a potential ally. The official said the Home Ministry has also asked if oil and gas can be exported. &amp;quot;That is ridiculous to even think. Production Sharing Contract (PSC) bars export of oil and the Supreme Court has upheld the government's absolute powers to decide users of natural gas. So while India is energy deficit, no government can even think of exporting gas.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;There is no way that BP can take oil and gas produced from Reliance blocks to the UK,&amp;quot; he added. Europe's second biggest oil company, BP will pay USD 7.2 billion for a 30% stake in 23 out of 26 exploration blocks held by Reliance and a performance payment of up to USD 1.8 billion if the tie-up leads to the development of commercial discoveries. Reliance and BP will also form an equal joint venture for the import, marketing and transportation of natural gas. After the NOC from the Home Ministry, the Petroleum Ministry will accord in-principle approval to the transaction, after which amendments to the production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) of the 23 blocks would be effected to induct BP as a partner. Reliance will retain operatorship of all 23 blocks. &amp;quot;The BP-Reliance move to form a joint venture for transporting and marketing natural gas in India is widely expected to spell trouble for public sector gas major GAIL,&amp;quot; the Home Ministry's June 1 letter said. Stating that GAIL, ONGC and Oil India had to foot Rs 25,200 crore out of the Rs 75,600 crore retailers lost on selling fuel below cost, it said, &amp;quot;Oil PSUs' share in the marketing of natural gas would take a big hit if the BP-Reliance duo enters the segment in a big way, which it is expected to do so.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;30% stake in Reliance's gas and oil assets could have been offered to GAIL or any other PSU which could have raised the USD 7.2 billion as a consortium,&amp;quot; it added. Also, the ministry said it needs to be &amp;quot;ascertained whether the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) agreement/contract under which Reliance bought the oil wells had a provision for the sale of assets and whether the Reliance-BP deal would enable BP to sell/transport gas outside the country.&amp;quot; The Oil Ministry official said NELP provides for farm-outs or stake sales and Reliance's agreement with BP was in perfect conformity with that. The USD 7.2 billion Reliance-BP deal is seen as the biggest FDI into India. A much larger proposed transaction -- Posco's USD 12 billion investment announced years ago for a steel plant in Orissa -- is yet to take off.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Reliance is the operator in all the 23 blocks, while Canadian Niko Resources and UK's Hardy Oil have minority 10% interest in a few.

The Home Ministry, which was asked by the Petroleum Ministry to give security clearance to India's biggest foreign direct investment, gave its no-objection certificate (NOC) on June 1, a top oil ministry official said here today. While giving the NOC, the Home Ministry asked if Reliance could not have offered the stake to state-owned gas utility GAIL India or any other PSU. Reliance brought in BP to leverage Europe's second biggest firm's expertise in producing oil and gas from deepsea areas. Reliance has been facing sub-surface technical problems at its eastern offshore KG-D6 fields, where production has fallen from 61.5 million standard cubic metres per day to about 48 mmscmd, instead of rising to the planned 69 mmscmd. Reliance hopes BP will help fix the reservoir issues and rapidly raise output to the peak of 80 mmscmd. The official said no Indian company -- private or public sector -- has deepsea expertise and a gas marketing company like GAIL could not have added any value to KG-D6 or other blocks of Reliance. Oil and Natural Gas Corp, the nation's largest state explorer, is in fact struggling to put together a viable development plan for discoveries it has made in a block adjacent to KG-D6 in the Krishna-Godavari basin. ONGC itself has been seeking partners for that block and had shortlistedBP as a potential ally. The official said the Home Ministry has also asked if oil and gas can be exported. &amp;quot;That is ridiculous to even think. Production Sharing Contract (PSC) bars export of oil outside India and the Supreme Court has upheld the government's absolute powers to decide users of natural gas. So while India is energy deficit, no government can even think of exporting gas.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;There is no way that BP can take oil and gas produced from Reliance blocks to the UK,&amp;quot; he added."

While Reddy refused to comment on his 15 minute meeting with the Prime Minister this morning, sources in his ministry said the meeting was fixed a long time back, much before the CAG submitted in draft audit report on June 8. The ministry, they said, will take at least five-six weeks to reply to points raised by CAG which Reddy may have told the Prime Minister. CAG had asked for comments in two weeks time. The delay in ministry's reply may mean that the CAG final report would not be tabled in Parliament in the monsoon session of Parliament next month. Sources said the ministry is taking longer time as it has an entirely new set of officials. The decision on KG-D6 field were taken when Murli Deora was the minister and VK Sibal was the head of ministry's technical arm, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. Incidentally, Sibal too was in the ministry on Tuesday probably to explain to the new Oil Secretary GC Chaturvedi and his team about his role in KG-D6 approvals. CAG in its draft report had rapped oil ministry and its technical arm DGH for allegedly favouring Reliance by allowing it to double KG-D6 gas field's cost but it stopped short of saying if the Mukesh Ambani firm had overbilled the government nd thereby caused loss to the state exchequer. It also pulled up the ministry for going out of its way to grant over 856 sq km of additional area to Cairn India adjacent to its oil discovery in Rajasthan block. The CAG in its draft audit report on KG-D6 block said the ministry and DGH also bent the rules to grant &amp;quot;huge benefits&amp;quot; to Reliance when it was allowed to retain the entire block, but said gains cannot be quantified. &amp;quot;The increase in (Phase-1) cost from (USD 2.39 billion proposed in the) Initial Development Plan (of May 2004) to (USD 5.196 billion) in the addendum to the Initial Development Plan is likely to have a significant impact on the government of India's financial take. &amp;quot;However, at this stage, based on the information provided, we are unable to comment on the reasonableness, or otherwise of the increase in cost, both overall and in respect of individual line items,&amp;quot; accounting watchdog CAG said. Reliance, however, said that &amp;quot;as a responsible operator, it has fully complied with the requirements in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) at all times in conducting petroleum operations, and refutes any suggestion to the contrary&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The KG-D6 project.. has been globally acclaimed for its cost effective, speedy, flawless execution and smooth commissioning,&amp;quot; Reliance said in a statement yesterday."

The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) rejected D-30, D-31 and D-34 finds in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block as commercially exploitable discoveries on account of low reserves they may hold, sources privy to the development said.  Reliance, which has seen output from its main fields in the eastern offshore block fall by over 20% since March last year, wanted to tie-up the smaller discoveries together to a common facility to produce 5.7 million cubic meters of gas per day -- double of what state-owned ONGC's newest gas field, C-Series , produces.  But DGH rejected the proposal to declare the discoveries as commercial, saying that Reliance and its Canadian partner Niko Resources had not provided results of tests done on individual wells to confirm the finds.  Sources said it also turned down the indicative production profile made by Reliance saying, &amp;quot;MDT tests used do not provide sustainable production levels, which is a requirement for evaluation of commerciality of discoveries.&amp;quot;  Reliance, in its proposal, had estimated in-place reserves of 749 billion cubic feet in the three finds, which would have needed&amp;amp;nbsp;USD&amp;amp;nbsp;877.2 million in capital expenditure to produce peak rate of 5.7 mmcmd.  The Mukesh Ambani-run firm had in 2008-09 made four gas discoveries, D-29, D-30, D-31 and D-34 in the KG-D6 block. In July 2009, it submitted a proposal for declaring them as commercial, a step after which the company could have firmed up investment proposal for bringing the finds into production.  Sources said DGH, in the first instance, rejected Declaration of Commerciality of all the four finds saying the gas volumes were too low to justify production.  However, Reliance persisted with its claims and DGH declared D-34 as commercial with an estimated peak production level of 14.68 mmcmd over 8 year life of the field with&amp;amp;nbsp;USD 2.338 billion investment in development, they said.  Reliance has seen output from D-1 and D-3, the biggest find among one-and-half-dozen discoveries in KG-D6 block, drop from 61.5 million standard cubic meters per day to about 48 mmscmd, instead of rising to planned 69 mmscmd because of high volumes of water being produced with natural gas.  It now plans to produce from smaller finds in the block. A Field Development Plan (FDP) for four satellite gas discoveries (D-2, 6, 19 and 22) is under evaluation at DGH. "

The public sector lender, which also has significant exposures to troubled Air India besides certain telecom firms being probed in relation to the 2G scam, has now disclosed that its credit to RIL was in excess of the limits prescribed under the RBI's prudential credit norms. Detailing the cases where it breached prudential limits for single-borrower exposure during the fiscal ended March 31, 2011, SBI has named RIL as also public sector majors Indian Oil and BHEL as three such borrowers in its annual report. This is the third straight year when SBI has exceeded the single-borrower ceiling with regard to RIL, as per the bank's annual reports for the past three financial years. However, the bank brought down its exposure to RIL within the limit on the last date of the previous fiscal, ie March 31, 2011, according to the SBI annual report. The public sector lender had provided credit in excess of prudential norms to RIL during 2009-10 and 2008-09 also. During the year 2009-10, the bank's credit exposure was in excess of prudential limits for Reliance Industries, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), BHEL and Tata Group. Prior to that, SBI exceeded prudential credit limits during 2008-09 with regard&amp;amp;nbsp; to its exposure to RIL and IOC. As per RBI guidelines, the exposure ceiling limits are 15% of capital funds in case of a single borrower and 40% of capital funds in the case of a borrower group. However, the credit exposure to a single borrower can go up to 20%, if the additional 5% exposure is on account of extension of credit to infrastructure projects. Similarly, the credit exposure to borrowers belonging to a group may go up to 50%, if the additional 10% exposure is for credit to infrastructure projects. The bank's exposure to telecom companies recently came under criticism as some of these companies are facing probes in connection with the 2G scam involving alleged breach of regulations in allotment of licenses. In an analyst conference after the bank's full-year results for 2010-11, SBI disclosed that its exposure to telecom companies was Rs 22,600 crore (3% of its loan book), while exposure to telecom companies under investigation was Rs 1500 crore. Besides, its exposure to airline companies, including troubled Air India was Rs 4,500 crore. The bank also disclosed a total exposure of Rs 1,00,000crore in the infrastructure sector, including Rs 30,000 croreto the power sector. With regard to single-borrower exposure limit exceeded in 2010-11, SBI said in its annual report, that its credit to RIL breached the prudential ceiling on three occasions during the year -- between April and July 2010, from August to October 2010 and from November 2010 to February 2011. Between April and July 2010, SBI's exposure to RIL was Rs 15,815.48 crore, as against a ceiling of Rs 13,646.26 crore, while the exposures exceeded the respective limits by well over Rs 1,000 crore on two other occasions also. The outstanding exposure to RIL as on March 31, 2011stood at Rs 5,645.44 crore, which was within the limits. For IOC and BHEL also, the credit exposure exceeded the ceiling on three occasions during 2010-11. During the year 2009-10, the credit exposure exceeded the prudential ceilings on three occasions each for IOC, RIL and BHEL, while the exposure was in excess of the limit for Tata Group on two occasions. For 2008-09 also, the credit exposure was in excess of the permitted level on three occasions for both RIL and IOC."

RIL, which has 26 oil and gas blocks, including the giant KG-D6 fields, has been applying to the Home Ministry for security clearance of the specialised expatriate technical personnel deployed on its offshore vessels, including seismic survey ships, drill ships, tug boats and supply vessels. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) clearance is accorded to expat staff for a period of one year or the duration of the visit of these personnel, whichever is earlier. RIL in a letter to the Oil Ministry said MHA had vide a letter dated April 8, 2008 permitted it to move expatriates, within the validity of their security clearance, from one block to another block that are allotted by the Government to it. &amp;quot;However, lately the MHA clearance is being accorded to the personnel with a specific restriction that if the expatriate changes the block of stay within the validity period of security clearance accorded to him, then the operator (RIL) needs to seek a fresh security clearance for the same. This is causing not only difficulty but almost choking our operations,&amp;quot; it said. RIL said the high operation/rental costs of the mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) which comprise of drill ships, semi-submersibles and jackup rigs, demand prudent and optimal deployment between various blocks to fulfill its drilling and other work commitments. &amp;quot;Hence, these MODUs move between drilling locations at various blocks... Seeking fresh security clearance every time for (their) movement may not be practical,&amp;quot; the company said. Stating that the availability of specialised, trained expatriates to man these MODUs was very specific and limited, RIL said the MHA clearance once applied afresh takes a period of three-four weeks and idling of assets for want of specialized personnel imposes a lot of financial losses. &amp;quot;Hence we need flexibility in mobilizing these expatriates between blocks allotted to us. Otherwise it would cause huge financial losses in terms of idle assets / services and personnel,&amp;quot; it added. RIL has requested withdrawal of the requirement of fresh clearance while changing the block of stay and reverting back to MHA's April 2008 policy."

Indraprastha Gas (IGL), a joint venture of state-run GAIL India and Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), hiked CNG price in Delhi by Rs 0.50 per kg and in neighbouring Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad by Rs 0.55 per kg. &amp;quot;The new consumer price of Rs 29.80 per kg in Delhi and Rs 33.40 per kg in Noida, Greater Noida &amp;amp;amp; Ghaziabad would be effective from midnight tonight,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement here. Last month, state-owned oil firms had hiked petrol price by a steep Rs 5 per litre in view of rise in cost of raw material (crude oil).  CNG price were last hiked on April 3 when IGL raised rates by Rs 0.30 per kg. Explaining the reason leading to the revision in the price of CNG and liquefied natural gas, IGL Managing Director Rajesh Vedvyas said the rates have been hiked because of increase in cost of input (natural gas). Besides government controlled gas and fuel from Reliance Industries' KG-D6 fields, both of which are priced at USD 4.20 per million British thermal unit, IGL also buys higher priced imported LNG to meet the demand in Delhi and its adjoining cities. The increase in price of LNG has led to the hike in CNG rates. Vedvyas said today's increase would have marginal impact on the running cost of CNG vehicles. &amp;quot;Despite the aforesaid prices increase, CNG would still offer 66% savings towards the running cost when compared to petrol driven vehicles at the current level of prices. When compared to diesel driven vehicles the economics in favour of CNG at revised price would be 21%,&amp;quot; he said. "

The conglomerate also plans to invest aggressively in its retail business and will launch cash-and-carry, or wholesale outlets, Mukesh Ambani said at the company's annual shareholder meeting. Reliance, the largest listed firm in India , is controlled by Mukesh Ambani, the world's ninth richest man with a net worth estimated at USD 27 billion, according to Forbes. The company is looking to expand in sectors such as telecom, retail, power, financial services and hospitality. &amp;quot;Reliance is endowed with a strong balance sheet and depth of talent,&amp;quot; Ambani said, adding that the company was &amp;quot;uniquely placed to pursue multiple growth opportunities.&amp;quot; Last year, Reliance made a dramatic return to the telecom business with the USD 1 billion acquisition of Infotel Broadband, the only company to win a nationwide licence for broadband wireless spectrum in a government auction. &amp;quot;Broadband - and broadband enabled digital services - is the next big leap forward in the digital transformation of our knowledge economy,&amp;quot; Ambani said to shareholders. He said the company plans to build broadband infrastructure spanning industries such as education, healthcare and financial services. But energy is still the company's mainstay. Its D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin off India's east coast is its biggest gas producer, but output has slipped due to technical problems to about 52 million cubic metres a day (mcmd) from 60 mcmd in 2010 and short of a target of 80 mcmd. In February, Reliance agreed to sell a stake in 23 of its oil and gas blocks, including some in the KG basin, to BP in a USD 7.2 billion deal, and is expected to benefit from BP's deepwater exploration expertise.  &amp;quot;After the government approvals for BP-Reliance partnership, KG-D6 reservoir will be jointly assessed to address technical issues in ramping up production,&amp;quot; Ambani said. &amp;quot;Meanwhile, vigorous efforts are underway to accelerate development process of other discoveries,&amp;quot; he said, referring to the company's Mahanadi block off the country's east coast and the Cambay block in the western Indian state of Gujarat.  Ambani also said the company would be free of net debt by the end of fiscal year 2012. As of March 31, its long-term debt stood at USD 12.4 billion, and its cash and cash equivalents were USD 9.5 billion.

With output from the KG-D6 fields falling from 61.5 million standard cubic metres per day to less than 48 mmscmd, the Oil Ministry has ordered Reliance to first meet the full demand of priority users -- power, fertiliser, city gas and LPG plants -- before supplying to non-core industries. With output just a shade above core sector demand, supplies to steel plants, refineries and petrochemical units have been cut. Reliance is the biggest loser, as it faced cuts at both its refineries and petrochemical units. Sources said Reliance last month wrote to the Oil Ministry saying petrochemical plants like LPG extraction units also strip natural gas of its higher fraction before it is burnt as fuel in industries and so, should be given equal priority in allocation of gas. Natural gas predominantly consists of methane and small percentages of higher fractions of ethane, propane and butane. Whereas ethane is the feedstock for petrochemicals, propane and butane are mainly used for production of LPG. Since these are value-added fractions, the government has always mandated that gas must be stripped of higher fractions before supply to various consumers. Various petrochemical and LPG plants were set up in India as a result of this policy. Reliance said this policy was reiterated by an Empowered Group of Ministers, which allocated KG-D6 gas among various users in May, 2008. &amp;quot;The government had allocated 2.59 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas to (state-run) GAIL for LPG and 1.92 mmscmd to Dahej/Nagothane petrochemical plants of Reliance,&amp;quot; the letter said. &amp;quot;While making the allocations in line with policy decided by the EGoM, it was directed that all locations where higher fractions are being used as fuel should be identified and steps should be taken to stop such usage of higher fractions as fuel by supplying lean gas at such locations,&amp;quot; it said. Reliance said while other sectors like steel have an option to use imported LNG, gas-based petrochemical units as well as LPG plants have to mainly rely on domestic sources of rich gas. &amp;quot;However, we find that there is some mismatch between the declared policy of the government/EGoM regarding usage of higher fractions of natural gas and the lower priority accorded to them by Petroleum Ministry while directing sectoral cuts on KG-D6 supply,&amp;quot; Reliance wrote. &amp;quot;Again, there is a dichotomy that whereas the LPG sector has been kept as second priority after fertilisers, petrochemicals are considered non-core sector, though the usage of higher fractions of gas in petrochemicals and the LPG sectors is similar,&amp;quot; it said.

There are expectations of a number of major announcements from RIL chief when he addresses the company's shareholders at its Annual General Meeting on June 3.&amp;amp;nbsp;Speculations are rife that Ambani would announce major business initiatives and investment plans for RILs various existing businesses as also new ventures in telecom, power and financial services. Earlier in April, the company said in an investor presentation that it would pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities to meet its growth aspirations.&amp;amp;nbsp;Besides, it also disclosed an &amp;quot;investment programme of over USD 10 billion to cater to domestic market&amp;quot; in petrochemicals business. Earlier at an investor conference in February, RIL had projected investment totalling USD 25-30 billion (Rs 1,10,000-1,35,000 crore) for the next five years in its various businesses, including energy and telecom sectors. RIL has already identified 'new partnerships' that will be the core vehicle for its growth initiatives going ahead, after successfully entering into over 50 partnerships over the past five years, including a tie-up with global energy giant BP. Commenting on RIL's sale of 30 per cent stake in its 23 oil and gas blocks to BP, HSBC said that RIL faces an &amp;quot;abundance of cash&amp;quot; situation post this transaction. &amp;quot;RIL has already received USD two billion and another USD 5.2 billion is expected to come in over the next 12 months.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We believe RIL will be more eager to deploy this surplus cash, rather than return it to shareholders. Hence it is possible there will be announcements regarding acquisitions and the potential faster roll out of its telecom venture,&amp;quot; it added. RIL's cash balance nearly doubled to a record high level of over Rs 42,000 crore in the last fiscal ended March 31, while its very low debt-equity ratio can allow the group to borrow further funds for various businesses. Last year, RIL had raised USD 1.5 billion of debt in dollar-denominated bonds at very competitive rates and talks are already on for overseas borrowing of an equal amount.  In its report, HSBC said that it expects the RIL management to now &amp;quot;take an active role in the rollout of its broadband business having already invested (about) USD three billion a year back. &amp;quot;Additionally, with limited opportunity in India for deployment of capital, we would also expect RIL to pursue overseas acquisitions with increased intensity, else there would be increasing pressure on the RIL board to return a part of the cash to shareholders&amp;quot;. HSBC also said the management's time would be less burdened with existing businesses, as the issue of falling gas production would be taken care of by the combined BP-RIL team.&amp;amp;nbsp;Therefore, the management would be able to spend more time on &amp;quot;future growth vehicles like broadband and potential acquisitions&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The downstream businesses are running smoothly, with strong leadership teams in place, and do not require day-to-day intervention from decision-makers,&amp;quot; it added.&amp;amp;nbsp;The group is said to be working on various businessexpansion strategies for different segments and a consolidated view of these initiatives could be announced by Mukesh Ambani at RIL's June 3 AGM in Mumbai. In last year's AGM on June 18, 2010, Ambani had said that he was aiming to double the group's enterprise value in less than a decade, from an estimated USD 80 billion (Rs 3,70,000 crore) at that time. RIL's revenue rose by 29% during 2010-11 fiscal to Rs 258,651 crore, while its net profit increased by 25% to Rs 20,286 crore during the period. For the financial business, RIL has been approached by a number of global giants, while talks are also on for tie-ups with international players in the telecom arena.&amp;amp;nbsp;Global investment major DE Shaw Group has already beenroped in and names like American Express are doing the rounds for financial services business partnerships. In the telecom business too, global names like Verizon, AT&amp;amp;amp;T, France Telecom and Alcatel Lucent are being speculated as possible partners, although there is no official word as yet. However, the group's proclamation, through Mukesh Ambani's letter to shareholders in the annual report for 2010-11, about its intention to bring on board new partners of international scale continues to give rise to speculations about the&amp;amp;nbsp;possible partners."

It posted a calendar 2010 pretax profit of USD 2.2 million. Hardy expects production to increase to about 7,000 barrels of oil per day in 2012, after it drills more wells at the PY3 licence.

We're not in discussions with anybody,&amp;quot; Sharma said. In March, analysts speculated Hardy Oil could become a potential target after BP tied up with India's Reliance Industries to explore deepwater oil and gas in a USD 7.2 billion deal. BP had bought a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks, including licences D3 and D9, where Hardy holds a 10% interest in each.

Also read: Oil price view schism widens after May volatility Demand for diesel is expected to rise in May as vehicles and diesel-fuelled gensets were used for election campaigning. Also, dealers normally maintain high inventory ahead of fuel price hikes.

A date is yet to be announced for a meeting of a ministerial panel, earlier scheduled to meet on May 11, to consider raising diesel prices. Demand for petrol could ease in May after a record 8.6% or Rs 5 per litre increase in prices and softening growth in car sales. Car sales in India, a key indicator for petrol consumption, rose at their lowest pace in two years in April as higher interest rates, fuel prices and vehicle costs crimped demand in the world's second-fastest growing auto market.  India's crude oil imports rose 5.9% in April from a year earlier to 15.84 million tonnes or 3.87 million barrels per day (bpd). Crude imports would rise this fiscal to March 2012 given that India has commissioned a 120,000-bpd refinery at Bina in the central state of Madhya Pradesh and is expected to start another 180,000-bpd plant at Bathinda in the north in June. The data for imports and exports could change as it includes estimates for Reliance Industries 580,000 bpd export focussed plant.

In his letter, Ganguly gave a point-by-point rebuttal of Gopalkrishnan's finding that the &amp;quot;shortfall of gas production is due to non-drilling of the adequate number of wells&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;While the DGH-appointed consultant has reached certain conclusions on the performance of the D-1 and D-3 fields, we as operators were neither approached nor afforded an opportunity to discuss any of the field issues with the consultant,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;The consultant had not even visited the field to apprise himself of the actual conditions and field performance,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The conclusions are further contrary to the facts and information provided by us from time-to-time to the DGH.&amp;quot;The DGH is using this report to make Reliance carry out the impossible task of drilling two wells by next month and another nine by the fiscal-end. This despite the fact that each well takes up to six months to be completed and there was a very small weather window available for drilling in the Bay of Bengal. The regulator is mulling over the action it can take against Reliance for failing to meet this commitment, sources said. Ganguly stated that Reliance neither had access to the consultant nor was the full report prepared by Gopalkrishnan ever provided to the company. &amp;quot;From the conclusions that have been conveyed to us, it seems that the consultant either has not been provided or has not considered all reservoir/production data or it would not have been difficult for him to appreciate some very obvious reservoir pressure trends in the field that contradict the conclusions reached by the consultant,&amp;quot; he wrote."

On Monday, India's upstream regulator said gas production from Reliance's KG-D6 field had fallen further and the company had been asked to drill 11 new wells by April 1, 2012, to boost output. The concerns over Reliance's gas production have for months dampened growth outlook for the Indian energy giant and kept its shares under pressure. The company, which has agreed a broad partnership with multinational BP on field development in a deal worth USD 7.2 billion, said in March it wanted to work to overcome &amp;quot;the technical challenge involved in these complex reservoirs&amp;quot;.  Reliance, India's largest listed firm, posted a record quarterly profit last month, but still missed forecasts due to flat production from gas blocks and lower-than-expected refining margins. "

The 'AAA' national ratings denote the highest rating assigned by the agency and is assigned to issuers or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk. A 'BBB' denote a moderate default risk relative. It added that the rating has also taken into account RIL's scale of operations in key product lines, its record of robust cash flow from operations and the company's strong liquidity position. &amp;quot;The local currency IDR outlook revision reflects the likelihood of RIL's credit metrics strengthening further, subject to the closure of its proposed deal with BP Plc and no major investment being announced,&amp;quot; Fitch said.

The sector has started to catch up with India's world-famous IT and services industry to sate demand for anything from cars to air-conditioners to flat-screen TVs in the homes of hundreds of millions of newly affluent Indians who are ready to splurge. The potential is vast for the likes of LG, which plans to double its India revenue in just four years pumping out appliances every few seconds at its factory outside New Delhi, products that were seen as rare luxuries before economic liberalisation. But creaky infrastructure, erratic policies and a shortage of skilled labour mean factory growth has yet to emerge from the shadows of neighbouring China's prowess. Manufacturing makes up about a third of China's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to a 16%&amp;amp;nbsp;share in India, the same as it was 20 years ago. New Delhi has set an ambitious target to raise that figure to 25% in a decade. &amp;quot;Manufacturers are becoming optimistic, but my feeling is that a huge level of manufacturing coming to India has still too many challenges,&amp;quot; said LG's Chief Operating Officer Yasho Verma. &amp;quot;This type of factory is OK. But if suppose LG decides tomorrow it should have 20 factories in India, then it's a major problem,&amp;quot; he said in an interview at LG's plant. The trade ministry has raised &amp;quot;serious concern&amp;quot; that the current account deficit may become unsustainable as India's trade deficit is set to balloon to USD 278.5 billion by 2014, a twenty-fold increase over a decade from the USD 14.3 billion in 2004. &amp;quot;A large widening of the trade deficit can potentially result in payments difficulties,&amp;quot; it said in a recent strategy document. &amp;quot;Such a situation is simply unacceptable because it may jeopardize the entire growth process.&amp;quot; India can no longer rely on a mix of its IT and service sector heft, remittances from its citizens working overseas and capital flows to finance a huge import bill of one of the world's fastest growing economies. Manufacturing may need to plug the gap and provide jobs for the tens of millions expected to enter the workforce in the next decade who cannot be absorbed in farming or IT and services. &amp;quot;If India is to achieve its stated goals on GDP growth and more importantly, to generate higher levels of employment for the growing young population, India's manufacturing sector has to enter into a new orbit of even higher growth,&amp;quot; said a report by the Boston Consulting Group, which suggested India's manufacturing sector should aim to grow an annual 11 percent. &amp;quot;If India has to target a high growth of 11% for its manufacturing sector over next 15 years, it needs to necessarily focus on growing its exports much faster,&amp;quot; it said. The government in February estimated manufacturing growth in the 2010/2011 fiscal year at 8.8%.  Not perfect, but getting better Reuters spoke to four executives from manufacturing firms who have set up shop in India. The consensus was that, while things aren't perfect, they're improving rapidly and India is starting to shed its tag as a manufacturing laggard. A maturing supplier base, the influx of seasoned global firms and an explosion in demand have brought transformation even in the last couple of years to a sector infamous for its red tape, countless licence requirements and pitiful output before liberalisation began in 1991. &amp;quot;I've been here living in the country for 18 months, I've been coming here for 10 years, and I can tell you in the 18 months I've seen a huge difference,&amp;quot; said John Flannery, the India chief executive of General Electric Co. &amp;quot;The things that we would ask or expect of our supply chain today are quite different than what we could even think about two years ago. So it's changing very quickly,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;You look at the best companies today, the best manufacturing companies today, they're very very sophisticated. And you wouldn't have seen that 5-10 years ago.&amp;quot; Indian suppliers no longer work on the principle of &amp;quot;jugaad&amp;quot; -- a Hindi word for muddling through problems with quick fixes that flourished during the days of the so-called &amp;quot;Licence Raj&amp;quot; -- which had created a culture of short-termism and inefficiency, LG's Verma said. A more sophisticated supplier base makes it simpler and cheaper for foreign firms to set up factories on Indian soil and even look to India as a major exporter further down the line. Cars leaving the assembly line of General Motors in India are now up to 98% locally produced, designed with the help of 2,000 engineers in the company's Bangalore offices. Hyundai Motor Co has made India an export hub for its vehicles. From 20 Santros sold to Nepal in 1999, the firm exported 247,102 &amp;quot;Made in India&amp;quot; cars globally last year, the highest number in any country outside the company's native South Korea.  Policy, infrastructure hurdles But India's infrastructure development has not kept pace with the demands of its manufacturing. Power is in short supply, highways are clogged with traffic and ports are too crowded. The average cost to move a container within India is USD 945, more than double the USD 460 it costs in China. Due to restrictions on goods traffic, Hyundai can only ship cars from its Chennai plant to the coast for seven hours at night, said Arvind Saxena, a director of Hyundai Motor India. &amp;quot;Infrastructure has improved ... but yes, a lot still needs to be done,&amp;quot; he said. LG's Verma would like to see the government adopt China-style policies to foster growth of Indian suppliers. &amp;quot;The Chinese government has spent a huge lot of money, creating cities where the vendors will be placed, creating infrastructure there,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Those things are not in focus in India.&amp;quot; Companies have also grappled with slow or inconsistent policy decisions from the Indian government. For example, five years ago New Delhi rolled out a policy for so-called Special Economic Zones (SEZs), hubs with long tax holidays that were set up in Beijing's footsteps to spur manufacturing growth. But the finance ministry slapped a 18.5% duty on book profits in the zones in February's budget, sparking criticism from the trade ministry that the tax would send the wrong signal about India's credibility with investors.  Karl Slym, the head of GM India, cheers what he sees as largely business-friendly policies from the government for auto makers. But some decisions from New Delhi come out of the blue and catch investors unawares, he said. &amp;quot;Nobody has the chance to be able to respond correctly or be able to manage the situation,&amp;quot; Slym told Reuters. &amp;quot;If you know what the outlook is, what the playing field is, then you can plan accordingly for that. But if you start out playing football on a football field and then all of a sudden you're trying to play on a cricket field then you've got the wrong equipment to be able to perform the best,&amp;quot; he added. Whatever its problems, the four companies interviewed by Reuters remain largely optimistic on India's manufacturing rise. And as global firms look to ride India's 9% growth story, Asia's third-largest economy has also flexed its export muscle with the growth of domestic brands. The trade ministry has set India a target to double its exports by 2014 to help keep the deficit in check. No longer known just for its iconic exports such as textiles and gems, India's manufacturers are becoming household names in sectors such as cars, generic medicines and oil products. Reliance Industries, owned by tycoon Mukesh Ambani, operates the world's biggest oil refining complex. India's Tata Group is Britain's biggest manufacturing employer. &amp;quot;The overall long term growth for the country, the capabilities within the country, far outweigh any short-term issues,&amp;quot; GM's Slym said. &amp;quot;They're just hindrances.&amp;quot;"

Asia's third-largest economy needs private capital for exploration and is encouraging local firms to buy stakes in foreign oil and gas projects to meet its surging energy needs. India imports over 70% of the crude it uses and is keen to tap quickly domestic reservoirs. Global oil firms are more inclined to invest in countries with higher prospects for finds, but India's position has also suffered because of bureaucratic sloth. &amp;quot;Prospectivity is the key issue ... But India can be a difficult country to do business in. There's the issue of bureaucracy,&amp;quot; said Sara Pourghorbani, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie for India. &amp;quot;Bureaucracy actually seems to be quite a major issue for India. The pace of decision-making is quite slow,&amp;quot; Pourghorbani added. Monday's auction largely drew interest from international companies that already operate in India such as BG, BHP Billiton and Cairn Energy. Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy called the response to the auction &amp;quot;more than satisfactory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;very encouraging&amp;quot;. BP, which has just bought a 30% stake in 23 Indian blocks owned by Reliance, did not put in a bid. BG, with BHP Billiton, applied for and won only one block.  Tightening scrutiny India is competing with big oil-producing countries worldwide for exploration interest that could help it achieve energy self-sufficiency. The situation has been exacerbated by a regulatory backlash as the government tightens scrutiny of projects to contain the political fallout of massive corruption cases. Oil Secretary S Sundareshan told reporters that contracts for the new blocks could be signed within three months. A total of 34 blocks were initially on offer under the ninth licensing round, but one shallow water block received no bids. The winning bids have to be endorsed by India's cabinet. Of the 33 blocks, eight are deepwater, six shallow water and 19 onshore blocks. Official data showed that foreign firms, including Deep Energy of the United States, had won five blocks, while the rest were bagged by Indian companies, repeating a pattern seen in previous rounds. A consortium led by state-run explorer ONGC had provisionally won 10 blocks, and Reliance Industries had won two blocks. The blocks are being offered under India's New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP), which was launched in 1999 offering more attractive terms to boost higher investment in the oil and gas sector of Asia's third-largest oil consumer. India is currently producing around 720,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, mostly from fields awarded decades ago -- less than a quarter of its 3.18 million bpd demand. Proven oil reserves amounted to 5.8 billion barrels in 2009 -- enough only to satisfy its oil needs for about five years, according to the BP Statistical Review. Indian oil firms are seeking foreign expertise to tap into the country's largely unexplored deep offshore water, which will require billions of dollars of investment. The previous eight rounds have been dominated by Indian firms, with ONGC and Oil India bagging more that half of total 234 blocks awarded.

Concerns over Reliance's gas production have for months dampened the growth outlook for the Indian energy giant, despite the company posting its highest-ever quarterly profit in January as refining margins surged.

BPCL Chairman RK Singh said his firm has decided to defer a planned April shutdown of units at its plants, while Hindustan Petroleum is also considering delaying maintenance from April. The country's diesel demand, which peaks in the summer, is expected to be even higher this year as five key states hold elections from April and the fuel will be used extensively in transport on top of power generation. &amp;quot;Current diesel demand growth is around 10%&amp;amp;nbsp;and it will rise further in next two months mainly due to higher demand from agriculture and for transportation due to elections,&amp;quot; said GC Daga, head of marketing at Indian Oil Corp. India's domestic diesel sales, which make up over a third of refined products consumption, rose an annual 6.3% in January. . Refiners who had scheduled maintenance for April had been looking for at least 400,000 tonnes of imports in the month -- sharply up from about 110,000 tonnes bought in January. Last week, IOC could not get price offers for a diesel tender and had to abandon it while Bharat Petroleum had to pay a hefty premium for importing just one of the four cargoes it had sought. Gasoil prices internationally are likely to stay firm, underpinned by Japan's need for diesel imports as it gets reconstruction underway after a massive earthquake and tsunami. Asian gas oil swaps hit a two-and-half year peak over USD 24 a barrel last week although they have since weakened slighty, with cracks below USD 23 a barrel now as some Japan refineries restarted and run rates increased. &amp;quot;I am a state-run firm, I have to run for the country,&amp;quot; said BN Bankapur, head of refineries at IOC, adding if required his firm would defer shutdown plans. &amp;quot;It makes sense for state refiners to defer their shutdown plans as the monsoon arrives in Kerala in the first week of June and reaches Mumbai in the the latter part of the month, reducing demand for transportation fuel,&amp;quot; said an industry expert.  No change for private refineries Private refiners Essar Oil and Reliance Industries, which prefer to sell diesel to state-run firms than make direct sales as they don't get federal compensation for sale of fuel at government-capped prices, plan to go ahead with scheduled shutdowns. An Essar Oil spokesman said as of now there was no change in plans to shut completely the Vadinar refinery in western Gujarat state in May-June for 35 days for maintenance and expanding capacity to 360,000 barrels per day (bpd). A source with knowledge of Essar's plans said the shutdown was due from May 15 to June 21. Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar, plans repair work at a vacuum gas oil unit from later this month and at a coker from end-April at its 660,000 bpd plant at the site in the western state of Gujarat. &amp;quot;Reliance will be supplying less diesel to the industry (state-run firms) in April-May, while Essar will be fully shut in May-June,&amp;quot; an HPCL official said. &amp;quot;Reliance should be allowed to sell the fuel to us from its second refinery,&amp;quot; he added. The Indian government levies higher taxes on local supply of fuel from Reliance's only-for-export 580,000 bpd refinery, which is also at Jamnagar. As a result, even though the country has a refining surplus, state-run firms must look overseas to meet local demand. &amp;quot;It is a high time. The government should look at changing policy in such a way that allow export refiners to sell in domestic markets. It will be a win-win situation for all as it would reduce dependence on costly imports,&amp;quot; said Sushant Gupta, an anlyst at Wood Mackenzie."

Reliance has written to the upstream regulator indicating gas output from the D1 and D3 fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin KG-D6 block may fall to 38 million standard cubic metres per day(mscmd) during 2012/13 from 42-43 mscmd now, the source, with knowledge of the letter, said on Friday. &amp;quot;It is an extremely complicated reservoir, much more complicated than was thought to be in the beginning. This is the reason why the company joined hands with BP,&amp;quot; the source said. Last month, Reliance agreed to sell a stake in 23 oil and gas blocks in the basin to BP in a USD 7.2 billion deal, in part to benefit from BP's technical expertise in deepwater exploration. The letter, written last week, said output from MA1, another field in the D6 block, will remain steady around 8-9 mscmd. Reliance said in a statement the figures were &amp;quot;purely provisional and indicative,&amp;quot; adding projections on gas output could vary. Earlier this month, the regulator said Reliance was pumping 53 mscmd from the D6 block -- already less than the 60mscmd it produced last year, and far off peak capacity of 80 mscmd. Concerns over the group's gas production have for months dampened the growth outlook for the Indian energy giant, despite the company posting its highest-ever quarterly profit in January as refining margins surged. Officials at the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons did not respond to calls. &amp;quot;Our current estimates assume KG-D6 gas production at 60 mscmd both in FY12 and FY13. Every 10% change in gross output impacts our FY13 earnings per share by 1.4%,&amp;quot; RBS analyst Avadhoot Sabnis said in a research note on Friday. India's director-general of hydrocarbons said earlier in March that Reliance Industries' gas output could go up to 67 mscmd by April, as per its field development plan, if it drills four more wells by next month. Shares in Reliance, which is the heaviest-weighted stock on India's main Sensex index, fell the most in nearly 11 months and shed 3.7% to Rs 993.15 at the close, wiping around USD 2.8 billion off its value. The Sensex ended down 1.5%. Reliance stock was the fourth-most traded on the National Stock Exchange and had a total volume of around 11.1 million shares traded on both BSE and NSE, nearly twice its 90-day average daily volume. One trader suggested concerns might be overdone. &amp;quot;It looks like Reliance is trying to push for increasing the (capital expenditure). The fears of a decline in output are only a possible scenario. It looks like the market has overreacted,&amp;quot; said Deven Choksey, managing director at Mumbai's KR Choksey Shares &amp;amp;amp; Securities."

India, which has a total installed power generation capacity of 164 gigawatts (GW), aims to raise it to 187 GW by the end of March 2012, a modest target given a 12% peak-hour power shortfall that crimps its near 9% economic growth. According to the deal valid May 31, Reliance will supply nearly 2.6 million cubic metres a day (mmscmd) of gas, currently used by customers in Gujarat, to power producers in Andhra Pradesh from Friday, Oil Minister Jaipal Reddy said. In return, state-run GAIL will transmit an equal amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to customers in Gujarat, Reddy said, adding that the move would lead to additional generation of about 600 megawatt of power. The move to swap gas was considered as Andhra Pradesh did not have pipeline connectivity to LNG plants in Gujarat. Domestic supply of natural gas has risen significantly after Reliance started pumping from its deep-sea D6 block in Andhra Pradesh in 2009. Gujarat customers would continue to pay the price of D6 gas, while Andhra Pradesh power utility will pay for imported LNG price. GAIL Chairman B.C. Tripathi said his firm would supply spot LNG to Gujarat based customers. GAIL has signed a deal to import 0.5 million tonnes of LNG from Marubeni.  India, which imports over two-thirds of the oil it consumes, is actively encouraging the use of natural gas to reduce reliance on costly oil imports. Andhra Pradesh has gas-based power generation capacity of 2,700 MW but due to inadequate pipeline infrastructure produces only about 1900 MW."

State-run IOC raised capacity of its Panipat plant in northern India by a quarter in 2010, taking total capacity to 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) and emerging as India's biggest refiner ahead of private sector Reliance Industries. Reliance's Jamnagar complex, the biggest in the world, has a total capacity to process 1.24 million bpd. IOC will import 18% or 40,000 bpd more crude from Iraq in 2011 than a year ago, the sources said, as it has upgraded secondary units at its plants to enable production of Euro III and Euro IV compliant fuel in 2010. Euro III and IV are low sulphur content, cleaner fuels. Iraq's national oil company SOMO would supply 13 million tonnes or 260,000 bpd crude oil in 2011, the sources said, adding estimated total high sulphur crude imports by the company in the next fiscal would be 620,000 bpd. &amp;quot;IOC has raised imports from Iraq possibly to counter shortfall if any from Iran. Also Basrah is a proven grade and reasonably competitive with respect to other Middle East grades given that IOC has secondary units capable of taking medium-sour oil,&amp;quot; said an Asian oil trader. India and Iran are locked in discussions after Reserve Bank of India said in December that payments to Tehran could no longer be settled using a clearing system run by regional central banks, putting at risk imports of Iranian oil.  Oil minister Jaipal Reddy said earlier this month New Delhi had paid 1.5 billion euros (USD 2.08 billion) to clear pending dues for oil imports from Iran, the second-biggest oil supplier to India after Saudi Arabia.  IOC is still planning to keep imports from Iran under term deals unchanged for the next fiscal year at 30,000 bpd.  IOC's low-sulphur crude oil imports through term deals will be reduced by 7.2% to 130,000 bpd, as its 10,000-bpd deal to buy Tunisia's Zarzaitine grade from Algeria's Sonatrach has not been renewed for the next fiscal, the sources said.  The Indian refiner regularly buys sweet grades mainly from West Africa through spot tenders while it relies on term volumes to meet its sour grade requirements. IOC's head of finance and international trade SV Narasimhan was not immediately available for comment. IOC buys Girassol, Cabinda and Nemba from Angola, Labuan and Miri Light from Malaysia's Petronas, Seria Light from Brunei Shell Petroleum Co and Upper Zakum grade from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. To get Nigerian crudes of its choice, it awards a crude swap tender every year. "

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Satish Chandra, CMD, Madras Fertilisers gave his perspective and expectations on the fertiliser secretary's revival proposal for the company. Below is a verbatim transcript. Also watch the accompanying video. Q: We spoke post the economic policy and today we have the fertiliser secretary say that we have prepared a revival proposal for Madras Fertilisers, what we could expect in terms of a monetary compensation for the government, how far is this and what is the quantum of your expectation? A: The revival proposal consists of two parts. Part one is financial restructuring and part two technical revamp. In the financial restructuring, there were many creditors for MFL, one was IDBI and they had given us loan earlier and we had one time settlement with them. We had paid the entire amount of Rs 58 crore to them. So there is no loan due to them. Second is on IFCI we have paid Rs 44 crore, and we have also paid Rs 4 crore to small lenders like LIC and Industrial Investment Bank of India (IIBI). The government of India has given us a principal amount of Rs 390 crore and on that interest is around Rs 160 crore. So that is totally Rs 550 crore. As the fertiliser secretary has already told me that we have sent a proposal for the waiver of this loan because once this loan is waived then our balance sheet will be clean and we start with clean balance sheet without any loan overdue. Q: What is the regulatory procedure, you possibly go through for the waiver of this loan of around Rs 550 crore and when could we possibly expect this event to happen? A: This will happen very shortly because we have prepared a note for Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE) and BRPSE has advised us to seek the comments of other ministries. So we have sent a note to finance, agriculture and planning commission, once we get their comments. We will go to the BRPSE and after their approval, we need to go to CCEA, which altogether may take around 4-5 months. So we are hopeful of getting this. This is one proposal. In the meanwhile, the second for revamp and this rehabilitation of the old plant, we need around Rs 365 crore. Q: How are you going to fund this Rs 365 crore? A: The government is giving us a loan amount of Rs 365 crore. Already the implementation of the Rs 365 crore proposal has started from the year "

Asia's fourth-largest economy is expanding at more than 8 percent a year. But it struggles to pump even a third of the oil it guzzles, while gas use -- limited by poor infrastructure -- is already 30% more than production. India has sought to attract the big international players since 1999 with its New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) but still only two foreign companies -- BG and Cairn Energy -- are producing any serious amounts in the country. &amp;quot;This deal brings in one of the majors in a material way. Twenty-three blocks and an important gas play,&amp;quot; said Richard Quin, lead analyst for Middle East, North Africa and India at energy research consultancy Wood Mackenzie. &amp;quot;I suspect the Indian government is very happy about it.&amp;quot; BP, which has only one block, picked up through Indian government auctions, is now paying privately-owned Reliance for a 30% stake in 23 of its blocks, including the big gas producer D6 in the Krishna Godavari basin. The blocks now produce about 1.8 billion cubic feet/day (bcf/d) -- more than 40 percent of India's total production and more than 30 percent of total consumption. The British-based company figures there are at least 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas resources in the blocks -- enough to meet India's current rate of consumption for seven years. It is BP's biggest investment in exploration and production in Asia, with a potential total of USD 20 billion linked to exploration successes. &amp;quot;It would be wrong to downplay the prospectivity of the 23 blocks. There has to be a reason BP bought in. Fundamentally, BP is in the business of producing hydrocarbons,&amp;quot; Quin said. At the same time, BP could use its technical expertise to boost output at Reliance's D6 block. It is India's biggest gas find but output has slipped because of technical problems to about 52 million cubic metres a day (mcm/d) from 60 mcm/d in October and short of a target 80 mcm/d. Reliance will benefit from the tie-up with BP by being able to take advantage of BP's technical capabilities, analysts said, in turn enhancing the valuation of India's biggest company's existing assets. BP India head Sashi Mukundan would not be drawn on future output estimates. Scorching inflation, soaring demand&amp;amp;nbsp; The chance to boost domestic production has clear attractions for India's coalition government as it struggles to balance the need for growth to help half a billion people out of poverty with pressure to keep a lid on scorching fuel and food inflation. BP expects gas demand in India to grow nearly five percent per year to 2030 -- slightly slower than the economy's current pace near 9 percent. Consumption, limited by creaky infrastructure, should exceed 15 bcf/d by then, according to BP. Wood Mackenzie is more conservative but still expects demand to hit 13.18 bcf/d in 2030 from 5.34 bcf/d in 2010. But New Delhi will have to ease controls on pricing in order to ensure new, potentially more expensive, output comes onstream. &amp;quot;New discoveries would need a higher gas price than is currently being charged for the D6 gas (USD 4.2/mmbtu),&amp;quot; RBS analysts said in a research note. BP's Mukundan said the market could support higher prices. &amp;quot;Latent demand is being fully utilised and ... new demand will be created on market fundamentals. It's not going to be based on subsidy regime,&amp;quot; he said. Oil and gas prices internationally are near record highs but in India, the government controls pricing and subsidises output from older fields operated by state-run companies in an attempt to foster industrial growth and cushion its poorest voters. The country's population is the second-biggest in the world but half a billion people have under USD 1.25 a day to live on. BP and Reliance are also planning to join together to source and market gas in India -- likely to focus on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and potentially the construction of a terminal, giving even more choice for the energy-starved economy. &amp;quot;India will definitely benefit from this deal as Reliance Industries could invest ... for development of infrastructure,&amp;quot; Amrit Pandurangi, senior director at Deloitte India, said. Cairn caution&amp;amp;nbsp; India's upstream regulator was even more enthusiastic. &amp;quot;For the country it is a very, very positive signal. This will give a massive boost to investment to India,&amp;quot; said SK Srivastva, head of India's upstream regulator, he Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. &amp;quot;Other global majors will also realise now that India provides a favourable and safe business environment,&amp;quot; for exploration and production, he added. But whether India can now attract other energy firms to look again at its hydrocarbons may depend instead on the outcome of another multi-billion dollar investment -- Vedanta Resources' bid to buy control of Cairn Energy's assets. The acquisition has been bogged down over royalty issues with state-run partner Oil and Natural Gas Corp for six months and now India's cabinet has got involved, potentially triggering further delays. Industry experts were optimistic, however, with Wood Mackenzie's Quin seeing Reliance's presence as a big plus. &amp;quot;Aligning with Reliance is an important part of the equation. They can get things done in India,&amp;quot; he said."

Domestic refiners processed 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd) oil in January, government data showed on Thursday, as global refining margins recovered in the month and refiners stepped up runs to meet growing local fuel demand. Output from Reliance's 660,000 bpd plant at Jamnagar in western Gujarat state rose 10.2%, recovering from an annual 0.8% decline in December. February refinery output should also continue to rise but the rate of growth might slow as Reliance had shut a fluid catalytic cracker during the month for maintenance. State refiners are not planning any major maintenance shutdowns in the March quarter. Output of state refiners rose an annual 8.6% in January. Reliance, whose two refineries in western India account for over a third of the country's refining capacity, does not report throughput data for its 580,000-bpd export-focused Jamnagar refinery to the government. The country's crude oil output during the month rose 10.8% to about 765,250 bpd -- still a fraction of the overall needs of the world's fourth-biggest crude importer. Natural gas output declined 6.3% to 4.35 billion cubic metres from a year ago. Oil and gas output was less in January versus December due to a leak in an undersea pipeline linked to India's biggest oil fields in the western offshore sector. "

The sources on Tuesday said under the deal, signed in the December quarter, Reliance would import a cargo every month from April and buy regassified LNG equivalent to a spot cargo from the 3.6 million tonne a year Hazira terminal on the west coast. &amp;quot;Reliance needs gas for its plants as its D6 (producing block) gas is mainly allocated to other companies,&amp;quot; one of the sources said, on condition of anonymity. Reliance needs gas for west India based Jamanagar refining complex that can process 1.24 million barrels per day -- the biggest in the world -- and its petrochemical plant. Royal Dutch Shell through its unit Shell Gas owns a 74% stake in Hazira LNG, while Total Gaz Electricite France, a unit of France's Total, holds the remainder. No comment was available from Reliance and Hazira LNG. It is not clear if the LNG cargoes will be imported by the joint venture or the Indian firm alone. The joint venture should be operational in three to six months, BP India head Sashi Mukundan said last week, to meet growing demand in the world's second-fastest growing major economy.  According to BP's Energy Outlook 2030, India's daily gas consumption in 2010 was estimated at 6.1 billion cubic feet (bcf) and is expected to exceed 15 bcf in 2030."

Sashi Mukundan told Reuters gas prices in the Indian market had the potential to rise and, if necessary, the two companies would build a terminal to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) to take advantage of an increasing appetite for market-priced gas. &amp;quot;BP's estimate today is that (the 23 blocks) have 15 tcf gas resources ... there is a much larger running room and our coming into this (shows) we believe that we can jointly significantly improve the production,&amp;quot; he said in an interview on Thursday. Reliance's D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin off the east coast is India's biggest gas producer, but output has slipped on technical problems to about 52 million cubic metres a day (mcmd) from 60 mcmd in 2010 and short of a target 80 mcmd. Mukundan was speaking to Reuters a day after arriving back from Britain where the companies signed the deal -- the biggest foreign direct investment in India's exploration sector. The Indian partnership marks the second major deal under BP's new chief executive Bob Dudley, who last month agreed a share swap with Russia's state-controlled Rosneft to jointly explore the Arctic for offshore oil and gas. It is BP's biggest investment in exploration and production space in Asia and plants it firmly in the fourth of the emerging BRIC economies along with operations in Brazil and China, after it picked up little in Indian government licensing rounds. &amp;quot;We missed the boat until NELP V,&amp;quot; Mukundan said, adding that in 1999, when India launched its New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), gas prices were too low and the potential of the country was not widely known. Cairn Energy, which picked up blocks in India before the launch of NELP, is currently trying to sell a majority stake in its Indian arm Cairn India to Vedanta Resources but is bogged down in a royalty dispute with its Indian partner.  Hindu wedding BP has no current plans to buy into Reliance's coal-bed methane blocks, Mukundan added. &amp;quot;We have seen good shows in Mahanadi, Krishna Godavari and we have seen some shows in Cauvery, which we now look to build upon ... there is a potential for us to significantly grow,&amp;quot; he said. Mukundan said the deal was exclusive to both the companies and they could jointly look at further alliances. &amp;quot;This is a Hindu wedding. This will last forever. That's the plan,&amp;quot; he said, when asked about the duration of the tie-up. The equal joint venture between the two companies for marketing and sourcing of gas should be operational in three to six months, Mukundan said, to meet growing demand in the world's second-fastest growing major economy. &amp;quot;The (gas pricing) trend is upward ... the market has appetite for higher priced gas,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Latent demand is being fully utilised and ... new demand will be created on market fundamentals. It's not going to be based on subsidy regime.&amp;quot; India approves the gas sales pricing formula from more recent fields while older fields awarded to state-run firms have a subsidised price of USD 4.2/million British thermal unit (mbtu). Mukundan said that 25-30% of India's gas consumption is met by imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) which is sold at a much higher price and added that the government could agree higher prices for future field developments. &amp;quot;The government is flexible to look at each of the blocks on its own merit. There is a discussion that some of the more difficult blocks will probably end up with higher pricing.&amp;quot; He said the joint venture could build an LNG terminal and pipelines if it could not find capacity at India's existing facilities. &amp;quot;If we can't get it and we still need to get it, we'll look at the possibility of building our own terminal if needed.&amp;quot;"

(RIL) to positive from stable.,,"Business, Reliance Industries, RIL, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/sp-revises-ril-outlook-to-positive_525735.html,"Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor's Ratings Services revised its outlook on India-based Reliance Industries (RIL) to positive from stable. At the same time, we affirmed the 'BBB' long-term corporate credit rating on RIL and the 'BBB' issue rating on the company's senior unsecured notes. We revised the outlook to positive to reflect our expectation that RIL's financial profile would improve and that the company's exposure to India's country risk would reduce after its proposed partnership with BP PLC (A/Negative/A-1). RIL plans to sell 30% of its stake in 23 oil and gas production sharing contracts in India, including KG-D6, to BP for USD 7.2 billion in cash. The company will receive the amount over the next 10-12 months, subject to necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction would significantly improve its liquidity position, resulting in lower debt (after adjusting for cash and cash equivalents of more than USD 1.5 billion). Lower debt, in turn, would improve RIL's ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDA to less than 0.5x for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. We also expect BP's significant experience and capabilities of managing deepwater exploration and development operations to help RIL improve its exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) business in India. The operating performance of RIL's E&amp;amp;amp;P business had weakened in the past two quarters. &amp;quot;The outlook revision also reflects our expectation that RIL will begin to generate positive free operating cash flows (FOCF); the company has had negative FOCF for the past five years,&amp;quot; said Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor's credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala. &amp;quot;This is because funds from operations have increased to about USD 6 billion to USD 6.5 billion whereas capital expenditure is expected to be about USD 5 billion annually. The improvement in cash flows is on account of the improvement in RIL's operating performance.&amp;quot; RIL's liquidity is strong with cash and cash equivalents of USD 7.1 billion as at December 31, 2010. This is more than enough to cover long-term debt maturities of about Rs 5,000 crore due in one year and short-term debt of&amp;amp;nbsp; Rs 14,900 crore on as at December 31, 2010. RIL's liquidity position would further strengthen after it receives the cash consideration from BP. The company also has unused working capital credit facilities of about INR300 billion, good access to financial markets, and treasury stocks of about US&amp;amp;#36;6.5 billion. We believe that the sale of treasury stocks is a quicker way to raise funds than selling fresh equity. Large cash flows from operations further support RIL's liquidity position, as these are sufficient to meet the company's capital expenditure requirements. The positive outlook reflects our expectation that RIL's financial profile would improve after the proposed partnership with BP. It also reflects our view that the company's operating performance will improve and that the proposed partnership will preserve its competitive position in the E&amp;amp;amp;P business. We could raise the rating if we believe RIL's management is less aggressive in its growth plans and we expect that the company will maintain a modest financial profile by: (1) consistently generating positive FOCF; and (2) maintaining a conservative financial policy with a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDA at less than 1x. We could revise the outlook to stable if RIL shifts back to an aggressive growth strategy, resulting in a higher-than-expected capital expenditure or the company makes a large acquisition that drains its liquidity or increases its debt. The outlook could also be revised to stable if: (1) RIL makes a large investment in a regulated business in India, such as power; (2) the proposed partnership with BP does not materialize; or (3) we lower India's transfer and convertibility assessment to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'."

BP will take a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks and form a 50:50 joint venture with Reliance for the sourcing and marketing of gas, the companies said on Monday. The companies said the future performance payments and the combined investment could amount to USD 20 billion in total. India, one of the world's fastest growing major economies, needs foreign capital to boost infrastructure and sustain economic growth at its near-double-digit targets. Regulatory uncertainty and bureaucratic hurdles, however, have contributed to a slowdown in inbound investment. In the fiscal year that ends in March, India is on track to bring in USD 27.6 billion in FDI inflows, down from USD 35.6 billion in the previous year, a senior official said on Monday. Below are some facts about major foreign investments in India: India's environment ministry last month approved plans by South Korea's POSCO to build a USD 12 billion steel mill, a boost for the foreign investment climate in Asia's third-largest economy after several setbacks for big ticket industrial projects. Vodafone entered India in 2007, paying USD 11.1 billion to buy a 67% controlling stake in Hutchison Whampoa's mobile business in India, in which India's Essar Group is a partner. The deal is the largest inbound foreign direct investment to be completed. Miner Vedanta Resources' planned deal worth up to USD 9.6 billion for control of energy firm Cairn India, slowed by disagreement over royalties, will be decided by India's cabinet, which could delay it further. Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo paid up to USD 4.6 billion in 2008 for control of India's Ranbaxy Laboratories. NTT DoCoMo Inc agreed to pay USD 2.7 billion in 2008 for a 26% stake in Indian telecoms firm Tata Teleservices, giving Japan's top mobile operator a foothold in the world's fastest-growing major mobile market."

BP is buying 30% stake in its 23 out of 29 exploration blocks held by Reliance, for USD 7.2 billion. The transaction, which BP and Reliance said will be &amp;quot;subject to Indian regulatory approvals and other customary conditions,&amp;quot; is nothing but farm-out of interest. Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani said the deal is &amp;quot;of course subject to necessary government approval&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;All blocks (in the deal) are under NELP which has a well laid down framework for government approval. We will apply and get approval,&amp;quot; he told reporters in London. Farm-out of interest under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), the regime under which Reliance won the 23 blocks, is allowed and company farming out (or in simple terms selling out) interest is required to make an application to the regulator Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). Oil Secretary S Sundareshan today said Reliance''s farm- out of stake in the NELP blocks will need government approval. However the nature of the approval will be different from Vedanta Resources'' USD 9.6 billion acquisition of Cairn India as the deal announced today is not transfer of control. In Cairn-Vedanta deal, Cairn Energy Plc of UK is transferring control of its Indian unit to the London-listed mining group, which has no prior experience in oil and gas. The BP-Reliance deal is similar to what Cairn India had done way back in 2004 with ONGC when it farmed-out 90% of its interest and operatorship in gas discovery block of KG-DWN-98/2 which sits next to Reliance''s prolific KG-D6 fields off the Andhra coast. Cairn-ONGC applied and DGH and oil ministry approved it. Unlike the 2004 deal, Reliance is not transferring control or operatorship of the blocks to BP. Reliance said it will retain operatorship of all the 23 blocks including the KG-D6. Also, the major difference lies in the fact that Cairn has itself claimed that its deal with Vedanta is a corporate transaction and not a transfer of stake in the blocks. The corporate transaction, it stated, did not require the permission of government but reluctantly agreed to it. It made conditional application for approval on November 23, more than three months after the deal with Vedanta was announced. The application did not recognise the rights of partner ONGC. With ONGC asserting its rights as well as seeking resolution to the royalty it pays on behalf of Cairn India, Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy is referring the deal to the Cabinet for approval."

In April last year, Reliance agreed to pay USD 1.7 billion to Atlas to form a joint venture and own a 40% stake in Atlas' Marcellus Shale operations in the eastern United States.  In November, Chevron announced plans to buy Atlas for USD 3.2 billion.  Reliance said in the letter that Atlas filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday it would like to evaluate options including whether it could be able to &amp;quot;create incremental value&amp;quot; for Atlas. The Reliance letter said at no time during the seven months of Atlas' discussions with Chevron, Atlas reached out to the Indian company to gauge its interest in a &amp;quot;possible company-level transaction.&amp;quot; The energy major, controlled by Mukesh Ambani,the world's fourth-richest man with a fortune of USD 29 billion according to Forbes magazine, said it had hired Perella Weinberg Partners and Kirkland &amp;amp;amp; Ellis to evaluate its options. &amp;quot;We were very surprised by the announcement of your deal to be acquired by Chevron,&amp;quot; Reliance told Atlas in the letter. Reliance said during its joint venture negotiations with Atlas it was assured that the Indian company would be the &amp;quot;preferred partner&amp;quot; should Atlas choose to pursue a whole-company transaction. A Reliance spokesman in India declined to comment on the development when reached by Reuters on Thursday. The letter also said Chevron's deal valued Atlas' Marcelus assets at a significant discount to the value attributed to them in the joint venture with Reliance. Reliance has been investing in new areas such as shale gas as it seeks a foothold overseas and seeks to expand its businesses beyond petrochemicals, refining, oil and gas exploration, and retail."

This is based on the agency's expectation that ties between the government and its majority-owned oil companies will not weaken. India's state-owned oil companies dominate the sector, and Fitch links their ratings with that of the sovereign because of the sector's strategic importance and the evidence of tangible financial support. Consequently, these companies' stable outlooks reflect that of the sovereign. &amp;quot;Unless crude oil prices rise significantly, the market-linked petrol pricing regime that was implemented in 2010 will continue to operate in 2011. However, the agency does not expect diesel price reform in 2011 as the fuel has a higher impact on reported inflation, which is one of the government's key economic concerns,&amp;quot; says Abhinav Goel, Senior Director in Fitch's corporates team.  The government marginally increased the prices of cooking fuels -- liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, domestic use) and kerosene (public distribution system) in 2010. However, these continue to be subsidised, and Fitch believes that these will remain at levels set by policy requirements, rather than at market prices even in 2011. Consequently, under-recoveries -- which result when tariffs are insufficient to cover costs -- will remain high for these fuels. &amp;quot;The revision in the Outlook for the downstream public sector to Stable from Negative in June 2010 was based on Fitch's expectation that the government will continue to maintain the oil sector reforms introduced in 2010, and support these companies given their role as the government's extended arm for policy implementation,&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;Goel added. Fitch notes that India's surplus in refining capacity will continue with the commissioning of new facilities in 2011 and beyond. However, public sector refiners are partially protected by price controls. Private sector company, Reliance Industries (Reliance, 'BBB'/Stable), has significant export revenues, benefiting from more complex refineries than most international competitors."
