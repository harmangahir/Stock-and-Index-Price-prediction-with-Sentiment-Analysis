Though, to be fair, consolidation in the telecom space began hotting up soon after the government approved spectrum sharing between telecom companies in September this year. However, if the deal does go through, it will help Vodafone double its geographical 4G presence from the five circles it currently has. The Economic Times reports Tikona had bought 2300 MHz (4G) spectrum in the 2010 auctions in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, UP (East), UP (West) and Rajasthan for over Rs 1,058 crore. Vodafone on the other hand does not have 4G airwaves in that band. It will be deploying its high-speed broadband services over the 1800 MHz band across five circles of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Karnataka and Kerala. India's second-largest telecom service provider has launched 4G services across 10 towns in Kerala only. Among the major telecom companies in India, only Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have airwaves in the 2300 MHz band. Meanwhile, in a bid to further consolidate its 4G footprint, Bharti Airtel too has acquired 74 percent stake in Augere Wireless Broadband India. Augere, owned by France Telecom and private equity funds such as Harbinger Capital and New Silk Route, had won 20 MHz of 4G spectrum in the 2300 MHz band in the Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh circle in the 2010 auction. Airtel has already launched 4G services across 350 towns and cities in India. Currently, Bharti Airtel has 4G spectrum in 15 circles (combination of 1800 and 2300 MHz band). Idea Cellular too has launched 4G services across South India on 1800 MHz band. The company hopes to cover all towns and cities in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana by March 2016. The company too is on a buying spree and recently acquired Videocon Telecom's spectrum in Uttar Pradesh (West) and Gujarat circles. In an earlier interview with CNBC-TV18, the company's managing director Himanshu Kapania had said that this acquisition will take Idea's 4G footprint from 10 to 12 circles. One of the reasons behind the consolidation wave&amp;amp;nbsp;may be because Reliance owns the second-largest amount of spectrum after Bharti Airtel. It has also set up a 2.5 lakh kilometre optic fibre network route connecting 18,000 towns across India already.However, former Airtel CEO Sanjay Kapoor cautions that while Reliance&amp;amp;nbsp;has got its first act right &amp;amp;mdash; putting a lot of effort into getting its network right, the challenge for telecom players across the globe is getting a glitch-free network, which&amp;amp;nbsp;is a trial and error process and it could take at least two years to perfect it."

When contacted, RIL spokesperson declined to comment.",,"Business, Jio, MF, Mukesh Ambani, petrochemical business, Reliance Industries, Sarvana Kumar",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ril-withdrawing-moneymfs-to-fund-capex-plans_4512941.html,"Reliance Industries, the largest investor in mutual funds worth around Rs 43,000 crore, is aggressively redeeming various funds of late to invest into its soon-to-be-launched telecom arm Jio, fuel expansion of its petrochemical business apart from paring debt. The move, which has seen the largest private sector company withdrawing close to Rs 15,000 crore in recent days, is also seen as a way to de-risk its investments as it expects interest rates to remain high, sources said. When contacted, RIL spokesperson declined to comment. For long, the Mukesh Ambani-led company has been the biggest treasury player and used to net around 40 percent of its total profit from such operations. However, for the past few quarters, it has been steadily lowering treasury play to around mid-20s and increasing its investments in MFs and other long-term investments. At the end of 2014-15, Reliance had Rs 43,005 crore in mutual fund debt schemes and other papers, up from a little over Rs 36,000 crore a year ago. Of this, Reliance has reportedly moved around Rs 15,000 crore in the past few days from duration schemes to liquid schemes of mutual funds. &amp;quot;RIL is investing large amount in various projects like telecom (around Rs 1 trillion) and petrochemicals. RIL's 4G telecom arm Jio was supposed to take off by the month-end, however, it has got delayed now. &amp;quot;Moreover, the company is looking for expanding its petrochemical business,&amp;quot; LIC Nomura Mutual Fund chief investment officer Sarvana Kumar told PTI. LIC Nomura, however, did not say whether it has seen any redemption by RIL nor did it say whether the company had invested in any of its funds. It can be noted that Reliance has undertaken a massive USD 32 billion capex a few years ago to set up infrastructure for its 4G telecom services, Reliance Jio, and to expand its oil refining and petrochemicals business. Already, the company has invested Rs 1 trillion in Jio. An analyst, who wished not to be named, said when RIL started all its multi-billion dollar expansion it had no debt on its book at a net level. &amp;quot;I think with these redemptions, company is creating liquidity with a view to make zero debt at the net level and become debt-free on a debt basis,&amp;quot; the analyst said. It can be noted that during the past AGM, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani had said that as investment cycles peak, the company would strive to become debt-free on a net level, which should start from next fiscal. Many funds believe domestic markets will face withdrawals by FPI if the US rates rise. &amp;quot;RIL is taking a call in view of the fact that the interest rate may harden post Fed rate hikes, which is likely to be around 25 bps when it reviews its monetary policy on December 16. &amp;quot;In their bid to protect capital appreciation, they are liquidating their duration investment and shifting towards liquid funds which are free from any interest rate risks,&amp;quot; he added. Duration investment schemes are medium-term mutual funds that offer good returns when interest rates are low, while liquid schemes are almost cash equivalent."

However, volatility sustained within the range of a few hundred points on the Nifty in the earnings season. The close fight in the Bihar assembly election and mixed global news flow are adding to the nervousness in the Indian equity market. During the last month, the Top Picks folio marginally lagged the benchmark indices with gains of 0.5% largely due to a correction in Lupin and Tata Consultancy Services after their weaker than expected results. On the other hand, the quarterly performance reported by Top Picks constituents like Reliance Industries, Maruti Suzuki and Zee Entertainment Enterprises was ahead of expectations. In this month the lone change in the Top Picks basket relates to churn within the pharmaceutical sector. We are replacing Lupin (which has more than doubled since we introduced it in the Top Picks basket at Rs 917 in January 2014 and has significantly outperformed the benchmark indices) with Dr Reddy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Laboratories. The change is more of a tactical call as Lupin&amp;amp;rsquo;s financial performance would remain weak for one or two more quarters whereas the near-term growth outlook for Dr Reddy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Laboratories is quite encouraging. Though we would add a caveat that Dr Reddy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Laboratories is facing issues (observations under Form 483; not serious in nature) with the US Food and Drug Administration at its bulk drug facility at Srikakulam but the same, we believe, should get resolved soon.Top Picks: Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Cadila Healthcare, Dr. Reddy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Lab, IndusInd Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Relaxo Footwear, Reliance Industries, SBI, TCS and Zee Entertainment.

But despite impressive growth rates, many firms are struggling with balance sheets stretched by costly spectrum auctions and rock bottom tariffs, making the telecoms sector in India prime for mergers and consolidations.In the first such move in seven years, Reliance Communications (RCom), owned by Ambani's younger brother and rival Anil, has agreed to buy Russian group Sistema's Indian mobile phone business.&amp;quot;One thing is clear: India has too many players and too much regulation in this space. Not everybody can make a profitable business out of it on a sustainable basis,&amp;quot; said a telecoms and technology M&amp;amp;amp;A banker with a leading U.S. bank.&amp;quot;The dealmaking conditions were ripe for many years, but the push is now coming from Reliance's entry into the sector,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;There will be a few more deals happening over the next couple of years, and some (players) will fall by the wayside.&amp;quot;The arrival of Reliance Industries into the sector, under the brand name Jio, will further squeeze players such as RCom and Bharti Airtel.Bankers expect smaller players to be pushed into the arms of larger rivals, bulking up to battle Reliance's Jio.Currently most carriers operate on wafer-thin margins, with 8 of the dozen carriers, including Aircel -- a unit of Malaysia's Maxis Communications Bhd -- and Tata Teleservices, holding a market share of less than 10 percent, according to sector regulator TRAI.Players including Aircel, which owns coveted 3G and 4G spectrum, could be a likely buyout target, analysts and bankers said, in a market overshadowed by large players including Bharti Airtel and the Indian unit of Vodafone. Aircel did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Tata Teleservices, the seventh-biggest mobile operator, is, according to sources, looking for a buyer for the stake Japan's NTT DoCoMo owns in the joint venture. DoCoMo decided to pull out last year, as the JV did not meet performance targets.RCom's Monday deal gave it access to more high-speed fourth-generation spectrum that Sistema owned, critical at a time when there is a huge demand for quality and fast data connection as more Indians access the Internet through their smartphones.Others will follow suit, bankers and analysts said.&amp;quot;The industry world over has three to five major players. India has to follow that,&amp;quot; said Hemant Joshi, a partner at consultancy Deloitte in India.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network18, which owns and&amp;amp;nbsp;publishes Moneycontrol.com)"

He added, &amp;quot;This is an engagement which the Jio will be looking at across the sections of the society and I hope in two years we can look back at the achievement of Punjab (wherein) farmers, traders they can become role model for the rest of the country.&amp;quot; &amp;amp;nbsp;"

When the refinery reaches full capacity, it could temporarily cut the refiner's dependence on gasoline imports, said Mathew C. George, Chief Manager of Petrochemicals-Exports. &amp;quot;We have already taken the crude in. Commercial operation will most probably be in March 2016,&amp;quot; he said at the sidelines of Downstream Asia, an annual event held in Singapore. &amp;quot;We are running into a gasoline shortage and it is compounded by the fact that India will move into Euro V and Euro VI (gasoline specifications).&amp;quot; India, which has some of the world's most polluted cities, trails mature markets in the emission rules it follows. While the big cities follow what are known as Bharat Stage IV norms that are the equivalent of Euro IV controls, smaller cities follow Bharat Stage III. Europe currently follows stricter Euro VI norms. When the Paradip refinery hits full capacity, IOC would cut its gasoline imports but that would last a year or a year-and-a-half, after which it would have to rely on imports again as demand would outgrew its supplies, said George. India has surplus refining capacity, mainly because of Reliance Industries and Essar Oil, but IOC on its own is lacking in gasoline supplies for now and importing the fuel is more economical. IOC was not a regular gasoline importer until February this year. It has sought over 900,000 tonnes of gasoline for March to December delivery to various ports including Kochi and Paradip Gasoline demand in the country has risen after a cut in diesel subsidies increased the attractiveness of petrol cars."

Key reasons being: (1) refining margins will decline (we expect USD9/bbl) tracking the 23% QoQ fall in Singapore benchmark and expected inventory losses amidst 20% fall in oil price; (2) GRM premium over Singapore benchmark will however expand, as RIL will not be impacted by the plunge in fuel oil cracks, while correction in diesel cracks hurts; and (3) we expect petchem margins to improve, given 23%/27% surge in polymer/polyester spreads.

Net profit increased 8.0% Q-o-Q and 12.5% YoY; the rise is mainly on account of higher refining margins. GRMs stood higher at USD 10.6/ barrel compared to USD 10.4/ barrel in Q1FY16 and USD 8.3 in Q2FY15. GRMs was higher due to strong gasoline cracks (19.4 in Q2FY16 vs 19.8 in Q1FY16) product mix flexibility, robust risk management coupled with opportunistic crude sourcing and lower energy cost. Petchem EBIT increased by 8.3% on a Q-o-Q basis and 7.2% YoY, led by strong polymer deltas and healthy polyester chain deltas along with higher volumes. Retail business has been consolidated and posted an EBIT of INR 117 crs for the quarter up 5.4% QoQ and 18.2% YoY. Other income was lower primarily on account of lower accruals on investments. RIL's outstanding debt was higher at INR 172,765 crs as on Sep 30, 2015 when compared to INR 170,814 crs as on June 30, 2015. Cash in the books stood at INR 85,720 Vs INR 87,391 crs in Q1FY16. These were in bank deposits, mutual funds, CDs and Government Bonds and other marketable securities. Capex incurred for the quarter ended Sep 30, 2015 was INR 20,000 crs Vs INR 32,651 crs in Q1FY16 including exchange rate difference capitalization. Capital expenditure was principally on account of ongoing expansions projects in the petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar, Dahej and Hazira, Jio Infocomm and US Shale gas projects.Valuation: We believe over the medium to long term refining margins to remain range bound as capacity additions though it is delayed will eventually match the demand growth. RIL will further gain from efficient crude sourcing and product placement. We expect RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s GRMs to be between &amp;amp;#36;9.5-10.5/bbl in FY16 and FY17 (will go up by &amp;amp;#36;2.5/bbl post commissioning of petcoke regasification terminal). We expect margins to remain stable in petchem segment along with the petchem capacity addition and operational optimization. We also remain very positive on Jio as it is going for extensive beta testing and is on track for launch by end of the year.

The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) last month issued a notice to the declared 20 pipelines of IOC, accounting for close of half of the company's pipeline capacity of 80 million tons, as common carrier by reserving some portion of lines for use by third parties. The move would allow private firms like Essar Oil and Reliance Industries to get rights to move products on the 5,900-km network. The 20 pipelines have a combined capacity to move 38.59 million tons of products annually. Strongly opposing the move, IOC in its comments on the proposal said all of the 20 pipelines are for captive use. &amp;quot;IOC's pipelines are not being used for supply of petroleum and petroleum products to any consumer,&amp;quot; it said adding all of them are dedicated pipelines being used for captive purpose. The pipelines, it said, originate from IOC's refineries and terminate at the company's depots. &amp;quot;These pipelines merely serve as a mode of evacuation and of stock transfer.&amp;quot; IOC said petroleum product pipelines are not natural monopolies as alternative modes of transport (rail/road) are available. &amp;quot;It is not a case of natural gas pipelines where there is a natural monopoly as natural gas cannot be transported on land by any other modes. &amp;quot;Hence the basic criterion for bringing in competition for petroleum product pipelines is totally different, and as per that market dynamics, competition already exists in the market. Further IOC's pipelines since inception are intended and being used for captive purpose,&amp;quot; the company said. IOC said its pipelines are not 'common carrier' under provision of the PNGRB Act of 2006 and the regulator's authority in respect of those pipelines which are not covered within the definition of common carrier is limited. &amp;quot;IOC's pipelines are for captive use and as such dedicated pipelines under the 2006 Act. Without such dedicated pipeline, no refinery can be conceptualised and implemented on economic viability. &amp;quot;If the pipelines are not treated as dedicated pipeline, then the entire refinery industry will be hampered adversely, leading to non-fulfilment of public requirement,&amp;quot; it said. IOC argued that a pipeline can de declared a 'common carrier' only when there is more than one consumer. It says its pipelines cater exclusively to its own logistic requirements. Among the pipelines PNGRB had sought to be declared as common carrier include Barauni-Kanpur, Koyali-Ahmedabad, Mathura-Delhi, Panipat-Ambala-Jalandhar, Chennai-Bangalore, Haldia-Barauni and Guwahati-Siliguri."

RIL has a weight of 9.1% in BSE Sensex and 7.5% in S&amp;amp;amp;P CNX Nifty.The expected fall in RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s earnings is likely significantly lower than the steep 30% QoQ drop forecast in Cairn&amp;amp;rsquo;s earnings and is in line with ONGC, due to its vertical and horizontal diversification. We believe concerns about the sharp erosion in stock price (12% in 2 months) amidst plummeting oil prices are overdone, as highlighted by us in our recent Stress Test note &amp;amp;ldquo;Crude Defence&amp;amp;rdquo;. We believe the WTI-Brent spread is narrowing on falling oil prices, in turn enhancing RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s competitiveness. At 1x FY16E PBV, the stock trades at near all-time lows and compares with 4.2x that it was quoting at ahead of similar capex completion phase during 2005-07. The upcoming RJIO launch should trigger valuation re-rating for RIL. Maintain &amp;amp;lsquo;BUY/SO&amp;amp;rsquo; with a TP of INR1,248.

This week, equity benchmarks saw biggest weekly loss in last four years. The Sensex shed 4.5 percent and Nifty dropped 4.3 percent.&amp;amp;nbsp; The BSE Sensex crashed more than 2 percent on Friday to end at lowest closing level since July 2014. Foreign institutional investors have sold Rs 1,287.12 crore worth of shares on Friday (as per provisional data on exchange), taking the total selling to nearly Rs 4,000 crore in September. On the other side, domestic institutional investors bought Rs 1,128.7 crore worth of shares, who have been consistent buyers since August 11. But fret not! According to IIFL, dramatic fall in Indian equities recently, triggered by global sell‐off, offers a significant buying opportunity for investors. The best part is that one needn&amp;amp;rsquo;t go hunting for small gems as many blue‐chips are trading at attractive long‐term valuations. &amp;amp;ldquo;Large caps offer reasonably high business visibility and their relative attractiveness has improved with midcap valuations catching up in last few months,&amp;amp;rdquo; it says in a note. The brokerage recommends 11 large cap stocks as high conviction buy ideas&amp;amp;nbsp; with a combined market capitalisation of Rs 1,371,739 crore or 14.3 percent of total equity market cap. The large caps may provide a margin of safety vis‐a‐vis midand small caps in situation when volatility is expected to be high for the rest of 2015 on account of global factors. Here are 11 largecap stocks to buy: State Bank of India Setting a target price of Rs 328, IIFL says SBI&amp;amp;rsquo;s domestic loan growth is set to improve from current 5 percent year-on-year to 15‐17 percent (Y-o-Y) in FY18 on the back of economic recovery and supported by a healthy capital position. It says even a modest 12‐13 percent loan CAGR over FY15‐17 should drive a strong 25‐26 percent annual earnings growth. Reliance IIFL has a target price of Rs 1150. The brokerage feels over the next three years core businesses will drive a strong 25 percent CAGR in standalone EBIDTA on the back of commencement of large projects‐off gas cracker and petcoke gasification. It expects recovery in gas prices over the longer term as demand remains strong for the cleaner fuel. IIFL thinks a re‐rating is due given strong earnings growth profile in the coming years. ICICI Bank While the credit conditions remain challenging, the bank expects lower quantum of stress assets addition in FY16 as compared FY15. Credit cost for the year is expected at 90‐95 basis points. IIFL estimates ICICI Bank to deliver healthy earnings CAGR of 18 percent and sustain RoA at robust 1.8‐1.9 percent over FY15‐17.It has a target price of Rs 380 per share. Coal India An increase in share of non‐power sales volume would lead to higher realisations for the company as sales to non-power consumer is done at 30‐35 percent premium to FSA rates. Coal India is expected to report an increase in its margins led by higher production, reducing man power headcount, increased outsourcing and lower oil prices. Downside from current levels would be supported by strong dividend yield, with a target of Rs 454 per share. Britannia With a target price of Rs 3956 per share, IIFL says the company has immense room for growth in the core biscuit segment. Apart from cost rationalisation, key trigger for margin expansion from hereon will be premiumisation, increased focus in international business and aggressive roll‐out in higher margin business like cakes, rusks, dairy &amp;amp;amp; snacks. Larsen and Toubro The company has guided for 15 percent order inflow growth on the prospect pipeline for balance FY16. Revenue growth likely to be strong over the next three years as IIFL expects execution to pick up in the domestic market from H2 FY16. Management has guided for margin expansion of 100 bps in FY16. IIFL has a price target of Rs 2161. Axis Bank Axis Bank may deliver healthy earnings CAGR of 18 percent over FY15‐17 in spite of a marginal softening of NIMs. The return on asset and and return on equity (RoE) may remain stable at 1.7 percent and 17‐18 percent respectively over the period. IIF says for significant re‐rating, the bank needs to deliver on its asset quality guidance. It has a target of Rs 650. Tata Motors IIFL thinks absolute volumes from China will only improve from levels reported in Q1 FY16. XE can drive volumes for Jaguar portfolio as Evoque did to Land Rover portfolio. LCV segment is also expected to pick up from H2 FY16. Fall of 30% in the past three months has more than factored in the weakness and IIFL expects an earnings CAGR of 18 percent. It has a revised target price of Rs 485. Aurobindo Pharma IIFL says the pharma company is clearly building a differentiated product portfolio with large sub segments within the complex generics space and focus on vaccines and inhalers. It forecasts 22 percent earnings per share (EPS) CAGR and margin ramp up of 270 bps over FY15‐17E. It has a target of Rs 960. IndusInd Bank The management expects asset quality to remain sanguine in FY16 and therefore credit cost would likely be lower than budgeted 55‐60bps. A strong asset growth and NIM expansion would drive 30 percent annual earnings growth over FY15‐17 for IndusInd Bank. Industry‐best RoAs of 1.9‐2 percent and robust profit growth calls for incremental valuation re‐rating of the stock, says IIFL. Target price is Rs 1111. Motherson Sumi IIFL believes valuations are sustainable given the strong earnings CAGR expectation of over 50 percent. It thinks there is high probability of the company meeting its 2020 targets considering its strong track record and good visibility provided by the customers. Target price is Rs 400 per share.

The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km).

If discoveries in Cluster-1 get approved, the total investment will climb to USD 8.843 billion, he said. Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA.  &amp;quot;UD-1 lies in water depth of 2,400-3,200 meters and there is no technology to produce from such depths. And so Cluster-3 is presently not being pursued for development,&amp;quot; he said. While gas from the block will be evacuated to Odalarevu onshore terminal in Andhra Pradesh through 20-inch, 35.5 km sub-sea pipeline, oil is proposed to be taken on to an FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) anchored in high-sea.  Oil from FPSO will then be transfered to tankers for transportation to refineries."

India has surplus refining capacity, but there has been maintenance at some plants and petrol demand has risen after a cut in diesel subsidies increased the attractiveness of petrol cars. Petrol imports from April to June were the highest in more than four years, official data showed. As a result, Asia's average petrol profit margin for refiners, or the crack, in the first seven months of 2015 was USD 12.60 a barrel, the highest for the period since 2009, based on Reuters data going back to the second half of 2008. &amp;quot;Petrol imports are there as we are seeing a robust growth in demand,&amp;quot; said B. Ashok, chairman of Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's biggest refiner, which undertook maintenance at its Koyali refinery from March to April. In the first six months of the year, India's petrol demand grew 14.17 percent, official data showed, and trade sources expect growth this year to reach 17 percent. Although India still exports more petrol than it buys, a government source said state refiners would continue importing at least until the end of this fiscal year to March 31 2016. Higher domestic demand meant that total petrol exports for January-June 2015 fell about 5.2 percent to 7.2 million tonnes or 337,400 barrels per day (bpd), while imports have spiked to about 23,400 bpd from about 2,850 bpd. For all of 2015, consultancy JBC Energy expects India's petrol surplus to fall to around 310,000 bpd and drop below 300,000 bpd in the next few years, versus 345,000 bpd in 2014. IOC, the key importer of petrol, has sought almost 700,000 tonnes for March-September delivery. State refiners also buy petrol and diesel from private firms Reliance Industries and Essar Oil, but since they charged more for coastal supplies an IOC source said his firm had switched to imports. Further tightening the market, has been a switch by some north Indian states to less polluting Euro IV petrol. IOC's Panipat refinery is only able to meet 75 percent of demand for Euro IV, the IOC source said. India's strong petrol demand comes as major consumers Japan and Australia shut refining capacity and switch instead to imports. Overall demand is also growing. ESAI Energy research agency expects global petrol consumption to grow by 50,000 bpd to 420,000 bpd this year."

The loss in the December 2014 quarter was the end of RIL's 23-year run as the most profitable firm with a net profit in the country, overtaking the long-standing champion Reliance which saw its profit dip to Rs 5,256 crore as falling crude prices hurt its core business.

With this, IOC thus also becomes the first domestic company to sniff at the billion-dollar club in quarterly earnings based on the closing price of the rupee on the earnings day (65.10) while it was well in the club on the as the rupee had closed at 63.64 on June 30. During the reporting quarter the crude prices on an average fell 43.5 percent for both the companies. Even in the December 2014 quarter, IOC was very close to RIL with quarterly net profit of Rs 6,285 crore. The loss of RIL is more pronounced as only last fiscal year (FY15) the company had overtaken the state-run oil and gas giant ONGC to become the most profitable company in the country both on an annual basis with a annual net income of Rs 23,566 crore, against the public sector company's net profit of Rs 18,334 crore.(Disclosure: RIL owns Network18, which owns and published moneycontrol.com)"

The joint venture (JV) will be involved in development, production, sales, modification and life support for different sizes of aerostats, airships and lighter than air systems.  This JV will address the requirements of domestic market and also the regional and global markets. As part of the existing arrangement, the first medium size Aerostat envelope was delivered recently, the statement said. This was after successful acceptance tests were performed at Pipavav facilities.  The tests included integration and simulated mooring; verification of equipment and functioning of Aerostat envelope together with pressurisation system. In the present changing security scenario in the Indian context, there is a constant need of monitoring as the country has almost 14,000 km long international border, including a nearly 7,500 km coast line. Aerostat radars are a force multiplier as they are deployed extensively in the surveillance, reconnaissance and communication roles by the armed forces.  These are also useful in detecting low-flying fighter aircraft.

Accepting a government offer to conduct Drill Stem Test (DST) under limited cost to retain gas discoveries that otherwise would have been taken away for not meeting timelines, RIL has opted to do confirmatory test on two of the three contentious gas finds in the KG-D6 block and one of the two discoveries in question in NEC-25 block. RIL and its partners -- BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources -- will relinquish discoveries D-40 in NEC-25 block off the Odisha coast and D-31 in KG D6 block, sources privy to the development said. The company will conduct DST on discoveries D-32 in NEC-25 block and D-29 and D-30 in KG D6 block. Sources said the budget for doing the DST within the government prescribed cost of USD 15 million each was approved at block oversight panel, called Management Committee, meeting last week. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had in April approved a policy to allow operators to develop a dozen contentious natural gas discoveries worth about Rs 1 lakh crore at current prices. The new policy gives companies options to either develop the finds at their own risk or perform upstream regulator DGH-prescribed conformity tests before developing them and recoup the entire cost. Sources said the policy approved by CCEA settled long pending issue with regards to 12 discoveries in five blocks pertaining to&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) (six discoveries) and RIL (six discoveries). The 12 finds hold reserves of around 90 bcm of gas. The CCEA allowed companies to either relinquish the blocks or develop the discoveries after conducting DST with 50 percent cost of DST being disallowed as penalty for not conducting the test on time. The cost recovery for carrying out DST capped at USD 15 million. Alternatively, the companies were allowed to develop the discoveries without conducting DST in a ring-fenced manner i.e. at their own cost. The expenditure incurred in developing these finds will be recouped only if the fields are commercially producible. RIL had notified the Dhirubhai-29, 30 and 31 finds in 2007 and submitted a formal application for declaring them commercial in 2010, well within the timelines set in the Production Sharing Contract. But the Oil Ministry's technical arm DGH refused to recognise them in absence of prescribed confirmatory test. Same was the case with its gas discoveries in North-East Coast block NEC-0SN-97/1 (NEC-25) which hold recoverable reserves of 1.032 trillion cubic feet. For the very same reasons, DGH had not agreed for DoC of ONGC's D, E and UD-1 finds in KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block.

Barring a 6-month cracker delay, core projects are largely on track. Telecom launch in Dec-15 and its first ever detailed disclosure gave glimpse of Reliance Jio&amp;amp;rsquo;s network, content creation/affordable handset efforts and likely pricing. While voice strategy remains uncertain, we believe 4G subscriber conversion would be key. Large non-core investments even if accretive over long-term; any gains will be back-ended, diluting overall return ratio in the interim. While Reliance JIO commercial launch is delayed to Dec-15 (vs expected phased launch in CY15), a combination of (a) significant expected decline in the 4G handset price to INR4,000 by Dec-15 (vs INR8,000-10,000 now) and (b) significant capacity/scale of JIO planned at launch date (~100m wireless subscribers) would lead to increased activity in the telecom data market. Reliance JIO&amp;amp;rsquo;s voice strategy remains uncertain as no particular details were shared about how it would be providing voice services which currently constitute ~80% of the Indian wireless market revenue. We expect potential tie-up with existing operators for circuit-switched-fall-back (CSFB). Large-scale population coverage planned by JIO combined with low 4G handset prices can enable mass adoption of 4G services. However, rate of subscriber up-take would be the key as JIO would be largely targeting churn from existing subscribers with the proposition of a cheaper and better data offering. &amp;quot;A six month delay in cracker and low shale gas returns could be offset by better GRM&amp;amp;rsquo;s in FY17. On FY17E basis (standalone), the stock trades at 9x adj. EPS of INR104 and EV/EBITDA of 6.8x. SOTP-based target price stands at INR965/sh. Neutral&amp;quot;, says Motilal Oswal research report.

A government official said there had been no change in the ban and that Cairn India might simply be trying to establish a price for its oil via the tender process ahead of negotiations to sell it to local buyers. Cairn India, backed by billionaire Anil Agarwal, did not respond to telephone calls and an email seeking comment about the export notice. India is the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer and imports about 80 percent of its oil needs, leading it to place restrictions on the export of locally-produced oil. Despite this, Cairn India has sought expressions of interest from &amp;quot;reputed prospective international buyers&amp;quot; for the export of about three to five cargoes of 600,000 barrels each in the quarter starting October, according to the copy of the notice. &amp;quot;They may be looking at discovering price for their oil because the previous pricing formula was valid till March 31 and also now oil prices have declined,&amp;quot; said the government official, who declined to be named. Cairn India has been selling oil to Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;, Essar Oil&amp;amp;nbsp;and Indian Oil Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;for the past five years on the basis of a negotiated formula that allows a discount of about 10-15 percent to Brent rates . Demand for Cairn India's oil in the current fiscal year is likely to be higher than a year ago. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd's managing director H. Kumar said recently his firm could buy 8,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Rajasthan crude this fiscal year, while Indian Oil Corp plans to raise purchases buy a third to 40,000 bpd. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, a joint venture of state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp and steel tycoon Lakshmi N. Mittal, has told the government it could also process some Rajasthan crude, the government source said. Cairn India is the operator of the Rajasthan block with a 70 percent stake, while the remainder is held by state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;."

We will get a firm fix on the numbers once studies are completed. &amp;quot;IOC owns and operates eight refineries and has only a few weeks back added ninth refinery at Paradip in Odisha. Its eight refineries have a cumulative refining capacity of 54.2 MT of crude oil and addition of 15 MT at Paradip refinery has helped it regain the top refiner slot in the country. It overtook Reliance Industries, which has twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 62 MT. Essar Oil&amp;amp;nbsp;is the only other private refiner having a 20 MT a year unit at Vadinar in Gujarat. The official said IOC is also looking at raising capacity of its 13.7 MT a year Koyali refinery in Gujarat by 4.3 MT as well as hiking capacity of Mathura refinery in Uttar Pradesh by three MT to 11 MT. A small capacity addition of 0.5 MT is also planned at 7.5 MT Haldia refinery in West Bengal.Panipat Refinery was commissioned in 1998 with a capacity of six MT per annum. The refining capacity was doubled to 12 MT in 2006 and then raised by a further three MT to 15 MT in2010. The new expansion planned will cater to fuel needs of north and western India. &amp;quot;We are working on raising fuel quality specifications to meet Euro-IV and V standards at our refineries and so the Panipat expansion too is being reconfigured to meet the new specifications,&amp;quot; he said. Panipat refinery processes a wide range of both indigenous and imported grades of crude oil. It receives crude from Vadinar through the 1370-km long Salaya-Mathura Pipeline which also supplies crude to Koyali and Mathura refineries of IOC. Petroleum products are transported through various modes like rail, road as well as pipelines.

MindSquare Technologies is a group company of Mumbai-based 1neoteric Technology Solutions. Under the agreement, MindSquare has acquired the entire Indian customer base of IGATE, along with its over 400 employees that provide remote and onsite IMS services to Indian customers of the US-based firm. &amp;amp;ldquo;Apart from the capability of offering end-to-end customer solutions, the deal has also helped us bring on board marque customers,&amp;amp;rdquo; Neoteric Technology Solutions Head Anup Nair told PTI. These customers include Reliance Industries, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Communications, Castrol India, Anand Bazar Patrika, BITS Pilani and British Council. IGATE did not respond to e-mailed queries. Though Nair declined to comment on the deal size, sources said the deal is estimated to be worth about USD 5 million financed through internal accruals. Merisis Advisors advised Neoteric on the acquisition. On April 27, Capgemini said it will buy Nasdaq-listed IGATE for USD 4.04 billion (Rs 25,000 crore) in cash. Interestingly, IGATE had bought Patni Computer Systems in 2011 in partnership with private equity giant Apax Partners in a USD 1.2 billion deal. Set up in 2012 by industry veterans Balakumar Vijayendran, Sanjay Nayak and Vaishali Bansal, MindSquare offers a range of managed infrastructure services. Earlier this year, it received a strategic investment from 1neoteric and became part of the 1neoteric Group."

RIL and its partner Pioneer Natural Resources Co sold off Eagle Ford (EFS) Midstream venture, that owns a 460 miles pipeline network, to Enterprise Products Partners for USD 2.15 billion. Enterprise in a statement said, &amp;quot;The purchase price will be paid in two instalments with the first instalment of USD 1.15 billion paid at closing and the final instalment of USD 1 billion paid no later than the first anniversary of the closing date.&amp;quot; EFS Midstream venture was formed in 2010 to construct facilities to provide gathering and handling services for condensate and natural gas produced from wells on dedicated acreage in the Eagle Ford. RIL, through its subsidiary Reliance Holding USA Inc had acquired 49.9 percent stake in EFS Midstream LLC in June 2010. The Midstream system consists of 10 gathering plants and about 460 miles of pipelines. The system gathers and separates produced condensate from produced gas. It also stabilises the condensate, where necessary, and treats the gas produced from the Eagle Ford upstream joint venture operated by Pioneer with 46 percent. RIL holds 45 percent interest in the Eagle Ford upstream joint venture and the rest 9 percent is with Newpek LLC. It is being speculated that RIL may be looking at selling this stake as well. RIL, which bought 45 percent interest in Pioneer Natural Resources Co's Eagle Ford shale formation of south Texas for USD 1.3 billion, is working with Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to find a buyer. The Eagle Ford assets, spread over 230,000 acres, have become more attractive after the US Commerce Department, in June last year, gave Pioneer permission to export a type of ultralight oil known as condensate produced from the region. Besides Eagle Ford, RIL has two more shale ventures in the US - 40 percent stake in Chevron's Marcellus shale acreage and a 60 percent interest in Carrizo Oil and Gas Inc's Marcellus shale acreage in Central and Northeast Pennsylvania. &amp;quot;Enterprise Products Partners LP on Monday announced it has executed definitive agreements to purchase all of the member interests in EFS Midstream LLC from affiliates of Pioneer Natural Resources Company and Reliance Industries Limited for USD 2.15 billion,&amp;quot; the statement by the New York listed firm said.

The just completed Ranbaxy deal, its biggest to date at USD 3.2 billion, has given India's biggest drugmaker sufficient scale in generics and emerging markets to think about its next step - beefing up expertise in higher margin products and gaining a bigger global presence. On Sun Pharma's radar are US and European companies that develop biosimilars - cheaper copies of biotech drugs which have become some of world's hottest selling medicines, investment bankers say. &amp;quot;What has changed after the Ranbaxy acquisition is that their ambition has grown and now they want to become a global company which is more innovation-oriented,&amp;quot; said a banker at a foreign bank with knowledge of Sun Pharma's plans. Dilip Shanghvi, who with his family controls Sun Pharma and is India's second richest man according to Forbes magazine, feels the need for a &amp;quot;transformational acquisition&amp;quot;, but will be patient about finding the right candidate, he added. Sun Pharma, which has a market value of nearly USD 36 billion, is also interested in non-biotech complex generic medicines that offer better margins than the simpler copycat drugs Indian drugmakers usually specialise in. It is willing to look at either whole companies or acquire complex generics on their own, the bankers said, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media on the matter. In one potential near-term opportunity, they said Sun Pharma may emerge as a bidder for some drugs Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , the world's biggest generic drugmaker, will likely be required to divest if it is successful in its unsolicited &amp;amp;#36;40 billion bid for rival Mylan . A Sun Pharma spokesman declined to comment for this article. Shanghvi said last month the Ranbaxy deal did not preclude Sun Pharma from further M&amp;amp;amp;A, especially if the target company has capable management. But he also said Sun Pharma will focus for the time being on resolving quality problems at Ranbaxy factories. NEW M&amp;amp;amp;A CHIEF With a cash balance of USD 1.5 billion and a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.13, Sun Pharma would find it easy to take on debt to fund any large acquisition, the bankers said. &amp;quot;The company is also generating lot of cash every year and if they don't use it to fuel growth, it will erode shareholder value,&amp;quot; said an India M&amp;amp;amp;A head at a European bank. Sun Pharma, already the most acquisitive of India's drugmakers, this month hired Arvind Kumar, a former M&amp;amp;amp;A executive at Reliance Industries Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;and JSW Steel Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;, to head its acquisitions team, sources said. Kumar's LinkedIn profile confirms the appointment, although a Sun Pharma spokesman declined to comment. In recent years, Sun Pharma has weighed bids for eye products-maker Bausch &amp;amp;amp; Lomb Holdings Inc, which was later sold for USD 8.7 billion, Swedish drug firm Meda AB as well as German generic maker Stada Arzneimittel AG , sources have said. But now, Sun Pharma is most likely to gun for a biosimilar deal, bankers and analysts say, as biotech medicines currently account for six of the 10 biggest-selling drugs in the world and as it lags domestic rivals Biocon Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;and Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;in the field. The global biotech market, currently worth over USD 100 billion annually, will reach USD 200 billion in 2016-2017, according to forecasts by IMS Health. Previous Sun Pharma deals include the USD 230 million purchase of US-based dermatology specialist Dusa Pharmaceuticals in 2012 and USD 450 million acquisition of a majority stake in Israel's Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd."

Gas output from the field has almost halved to 14.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) in 2014-15 while oil production was 0.2 million barrels, down 22 per cent from previous fiscal. RIL said: &amp;quot;ONGC will take over Tapti Part A facilities in accordance with Tapti Production Sharing Contract (PSC) along with abandonment obligation.&amp;quot; The other part will be abandoned. &amp;quot;Joint venture (will be) responsible for abandonment obligation for the Tapti Part B facilities,&amp;quot; it said.  Abandonment means dismantling and removing infrastructure set up for production of oil and gas. ONGC official said the company plans to use the Tapti field assets, which include sub-sea pipelines and gas gathering stations as well as process platform, to advance production of gas from its neighbouring Daman field. The assets include Tapti gas processing platform, which received gas from sub-sea wells, removes water and other impurities before transmitting it to onshore.  ONGC will lay a small length of pipeline from the Daman field to the process platform, which is connected by a 70-km pipeline to its facility at Hazira. The official said the company is investing Rs 5,219 crore in bringing to production the Daman gas fields. Production is expected by July 2016 at the rate of 2 million standard cubic meters per day and peak output of 8.35 mmscmd of gas and 9,286 barrels of condensate per day is likely by 2018-19, he said.  ONGC holds 40 per cent interest in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields while RIL and BP have 30 per cent each. The joint venture will continue to operate the Panna-Mukta field, which primarily is an oil bearing field located 90-km north-west of Mumbai in the Arabian Sea. It produced 7.2 million barrels of oil and 70.7 bcf of gas.  According to RIL, the oil production from Panna-Mukta was almost flat while gas registered 8 per cent increase. Primarily gas-bearing Tapti field is located 160 km north-west of Mumbai and is currently producing about one million standard cubic meters per day and even this output is expected to taper off to zero before the year end. The Panna-Mukta fields are expected to stay in production till fiscal 2019."

Gross refining margin (GRM) of the company is set to surge to a 2-year high of USD 9.9 a barrel against USD 7.3 a barrel in previous quarter. Some brokerages also said there was a possibility of Reliance reporting a GRM of USD 11 a barrel . Singapore GRM was USD 8.4 a barrel during March quarter against USD 6.3 a barrel in previous quarter. The improvement in GRM may be on account of improved crack spreads in key products and also due to the absence of significant inventory losses. Crack spreads were buoyed by a 30 percent reduction in crude prices and planned/unplanned refinery outages. During the quarter, refining throughput may have fallen due to planned shutdown but surge in GRMs could offset that fall. Petchem profitability may improve sequentially as Q3 was impacted by low realised spreads on deferred purchases by consumers.

Among the domestic factors, Lok Sabha elections 2014, in which BJP under the leadership of Mr Modi had got the decisive mandate removing the political uncertainty and brought hopes for good governance. Sharp drop in crude oil prices and stronger rupee had improved fiscal health and led to a turnaround in Indian macros. Globally, steady recovery in the US economy had led to the US Fed ended the QE and readying for increase in interest rates, confirming the healthy recovery in the worlds&amp;amp;rsquo; largest economy. Our Wealth Maximizer 2014 performed well with Nine out of ten stocks exceeding the targets. We retain six out of the ten stocks and replaced four stocks due to expected under-performance in the next few quarters. Outlook for 2015Economic growth to reach 6.5%-7.0% during 2015 driven by good governance under the leadership of Mr. Modi: During the year 2015, Indian economic growth could be driven by reform momentum. The government has taken the initiatives to introduce GST, land acquisition amendments, insurance sector reforms and coal blocks auction bills. Under the &amp;amp;lsquo;Make in India&amp;amp;rsquo; campaign, Govt is opening opportunities for domestic manufacturing in Defence, Electronics Hardware &amp;amp;amp; Medical equipment from the 25 sectors identified to be given priority. The ordinance route chosen by the government for three out of the above four bills indicates the urgency in reviving the economic growth. Interest rate cuts to help in credit growth: Expectations over RBI cutting the interest rates by over 50 basis points were reflected in 10Year G-Sec yields. The reduction in interest rates coupled with the improving business climate could trigger a pick-up in credit cycle. Subdued inflation amid softening commodity prices: Crude oil prices after falling nearly 40% in 2014, are expected to remain soft in 2015 due to supply glut and lack of consensus among OPEC countries to cut the production. Expectations over lower consumption from China, European Union and lower import demand from the US could keep the global crude oil price under check. Up-cycle in interest rates in the US reflects confidence about the sustainability of growth: US Fed is expected to increase the interest rates by up to 75 bps during 2015, for the first time after 2006, amid expectations over strong recovery in GDP growth to around 3%. The sharp increase could result in outflow of capital from emerging markets to the US. However, rising interest rates reaffirm the health of the US economic recovery. Improved macros could bring stability in Indian currency markets: Amid expectations over lower fiscal deficit of 4% and current account deficit of 2%, on the back of lower import bills for crude oil and gold, INR is expected to display relative strength during 2015. Sustainability of earnings growth: Corporate earnings in India are expected to grow over 15%-18% during 2015, which is likely to be revised further based on improvement on execution at ground level, softening commodity prices and sustainability of the global growth momentum. Large equity issuance through disinvestment: Large equity issuances either to comply with SEBI guidelines on minimum public holding or new issuances like RINL could help the Government in meeting the disinvestment target as well as keep the IPO market buoyant. Money flows into Indian equities to remain robust during 2015: Indian equities continue to be the 2nd best performing asset in the world equity markets, as well as the best performing asset class in India. Indian equities are expected to attract FII inflows in 2015, that were around Rs 97,600 cr in 2014. Amid political/economic stability, direct participation of retail investors has increased, while retail participation through mutual funds has also risen as indicated by the increase in individual folios by 8.4 lakh during Apr-Nov 2014, reflecting confidence among the retail investors on Indian equities. Our take on the marketWe expect Sensex to trade in the band of 27720 - 35640. There could be short-term volatility as markets have priced in growth post the elections and multiples are at the middle of the trading band. The Sensex consensus EPS for FY15E is Rs.1635 and for FY16E is Rs.1980, implying a P/E band of 14 - 18x for FY16EPS. Sensex currently trades at 14x FY16E EPS. We remain overweight on Automobiles, BFSI, Cement, Consumer Goods, Infrastructure, Metals, Software and Pharma. We expectEarnings upgrades and in a more conducive environment for the businesses, corporate earnings are expected to grow over 18% in the next one year On ground execution of the capex cycle to pick up Stable currency and improved government finances along with a decline in inflation likely to present the case for lower interest rates Growing income levels and better job prospects trigger for higher domestic consumption Overall, the scenario is conducive for cyclicals, manufacturing and export oriented sectors. With the expected growth in corporate earnings, continued inflow of funds from FII&amp;amp;rsquo;s and renewed interest from the domestic investors, we expect equities to outperform other asset classes in the next one year and recommend to stay invested in equities. Wealth Maximizer 2015: Our top ten Largecap picks in the Wealth Maximizer (for a time frame of 9-12 months) are Asian Paints, Divis Lab, HDFC Bank, ITC, JSW Steel, L&amp;amp;amp;T, Reliance Industries, Tata Motors,&amp;amp;nbsp;TCS and Ultratech Cement.

This compares to double-digit penetration in other emerging economies such as Brazil (20 percent) and even higher for developed countries such as US and Japan.This has prompted concerns whether Indian subscribers will adopt 4G in any meaningful way.

Also, the 4G net additions are consistently higher than decline in 3G subs -- subscribers shifted directly from 2G to 4G skipping 3G,&amp;amp;rdquo; analysts wrote.A similar experience was seen in Japan and China.The behavioural perspectiveIf companies are able to launch 4G serves which deliver superior data experience (say five times faster than 3G) while being priced slightly higher, will it not achieve an attractive price-value equation? Analysts asked, while admitting that ultimately the data experience will also depend on the operator in question.How will 4G succeed when 3G has failed? JPMorgan wrote that the failure of mass adoption in 3G was partially a result on users perceiving that the 3G experience was not a significant improvement in experience over 2G as a result of lack of operator investments in technology and also because early on, 3G handset affordability was a concern (which is now no longer becoming an issue).&amp;amp;ldquo;Channel checks in China suggest that price points for 4G-enabled handsets have come down steeply. Tri-mode handsets are already available at about USD65 (RMB400 or INR4,000), while quad mode and penta-mode (five-mode) devices are available at about USD 160 (RMB1,000 or INR10,000),&amp;amp;rdquo; JPMorgan wrote.Is the market for data big?Finally, analysts suggest that the concern about low data use (on average, the Indian subscriber uses 85 MB data per month on 2G and 350 MB on 3G) may be confusing cause and effect.That is, &amp;amp;ldquo;once better quality data is available at much higher speeds, there is no reason why for example, YouTube user count and usage (interestingly Facebook, for which India has second largest subscriber base, also drives traffic to Youtube through video sharing) cannot increase significantly,&amp;amp;rdquo; they asked.The report does not focus per se on the strategy of to-be-launched Reliance Jio, owned by Reliance Industries, but says the company, which has a pan-India licence to offer 4G services, may &amp;amp;ldquo;provide the trigger/impetus for the non-linear migration&amp;amp;rdquo; from 2G to 4G. Airtel&amp;amp;nbsp;is also another player with large 4G plans.The other viewOthers have their concerns about whether 4G could disrupt the traditional telco business model.&amp;amp;ldquo;India is a voice-centric market, with 85 percent of sector revenue being voice. As a result, a new entrant with no viable low-cost voice strategy may struggle to get subscriber traction as a pure data approach has struggled globally,&amp;amp;rdquo; analysts at HSBC wrote.They pointed to the fact that long-term evolution (LTE) technology can only be used to offer data services, and even in developed markets such as US, the voice-over-LTE technology that 4G operators have rolled out (which involves making voice calls using data, similar to applications such as Skype) is too recent to be judged a success.&amp;amp;ldquo;RJio has the alternative to sign 2G roaming agreements with any of the incumbent operators (such as RCom) for voice services. Though there are no indications of any such agreement currently, we expect RJio&amp;amp;rsquo;s strategy to evolve over time,&amp;amp;rdquo; JPMorgan analysts wrote. &amp;quot;How RJio will provide voice services in the absence of legacy 2G/3G services remains the most critical and &amp;amp;lsquo;make-or-break&amp;amp;rsquo; question.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;ldquo;We think if RJio gets its initial service right at the appropriate price-value equation, it could provide the &amp;amp;lsquo;nudge&amp;amp;rsquo; towards 4G investments in the sector. Thus, we do not see any reason why 4G cannot surpass 3G in terms of subscriber count/revenues within 3 years of its launch,&amp;amp;rdquo; they added.

However, shale gas revenues increased by 2% qoq to &amp;amp;#36;270mn on the back of an increase in sales volume by 10% qoq to 41.4bcfe. Hence, EBIDTA grew by 1% to &amp;amp;#36;201mn qoq. However, realisation came lower from &amp;amp;#36;7/mcfe to &amp;amp;#36;6.58/mcfe. Cumulative investments in shale gas stood at &amp;amp;#36;7.6bn across JVs. Substantial part of Pioneer and Carrizo JV capex met through cash from respective JV operations. While Chevron JV continues to account for substantial part of ongoing capex and funding needs. RIL's decent performance during the quarter has largely been the result of lower depreciation and interest cost. However on margin front, it is too early to expect a sustained recovery in GRM. We maintain our weak/stable outlook on the refining cycle for the near term on the back of a higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. The incremental net refining capacity additions are expected to be 1.7mbpd in the current year as against demand growth of 1mbpd. However, in petchem, it is too early to expect a sustained recovery in demand and margins. In the case of petchem, demand remains a concern. Any weakness in demand could impact a sustained margin recovery. Gas production from the KG basin is expected to increase in the coming quarters from MA field (D26; part of KGD6). However, incremental production from other fields, mainly Rseries, Satellite Field, etc. is expected by 2016, but would be subject to regulatory approval. Although a positive government stance on RIL's E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts in terms of project approvals and gas pricing approval augurs well for the company. We remain cautious about RIL's refining and petchem margins for the near term, due to new capacities and/or weakening demand. However, with the expected improvement in RIL's business profile in the next 2 years, potential upsides from positive developments in E&amp;amp;amp;P and attractive valuations, we maintain an Accumulate rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1046(on FY16 SOTP).

This would mean muted trend in global GRMs. For RIL though, we expect substantial improvement in GRMs leading to widening of its spread when compared with international benchmarks. The key drivers for this growth include 1) commencement of petcoke gasification project in FY17, which would replace expensive RLNG with gas produced from petcoke leading to incremental US&amp;amp;#36;2/bbl GRM (management guidance of US&amp;amp;#36;2.5/bbl), 2) efficient crude sourcing, 3) high complexity at its refineries allowing it to meet the rising demand for cleaner fuels and 4) amongst the lowest operating costs in the world.&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ldquo;In recent times, petrochemical segment performance has been under pressure owing to weak domestic demand environment, rising feedstock prices and surplus capacity situation globally. While these are expected to correct in due course, RIL is doing its bit to garner further benefits from the revival in the cycle. It is expanding capacities across products and is also setting up a large off gas cracker. The cost dynamics of this cracker will be similar to gas based plants in Middle East. Resultantly, the margin profile of this plant would be substantially better than RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s existing petrochemical assets.&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ldquo;With flat earnings profile in the past three years, RIL stock has grossly underperformed the broader indices. However, over the next three years we expect RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s EBIDTA from refining and petrochemicals business to double.

Another 10 percent interest was given to Norway's Norsk Hydro (now Statoil Hydro).",,"Business, DGH, KG-D5, NDA, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Petroleo Brasileiro, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/oil-min-frustrated-kg-gas-project-ongc_1167774.html,"As Oil Ministry looks into reasons for delay in ONGC's KG basin gas development, the state-owned firm says it lost three years because the ministry and DGH refused to approve its partnership with Norway's Statoil and Petrobras of Brazil for the block. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had in 2007 farmed out 15 percent stake in the KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block, to Brazil's state-controlled oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA or Petrobras. Another 10 percent interest was given to Norway's Norsk Hydro (now Statoil Hydro). The two firm, who are among the biggest deepsea developers in the world, were to bring in technology and expertise to development of gas discoveries in KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block of ONGC. However, the ministry and its technical arm Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) did not approve the equity participation of the foreign companies, leading to inordinate delays in clearing of drilling programme, ONGC sources said. Frustrated at delays, the two firms finally walked out of the block in 2010. KG-D5 block was originally planned to start producing gas from 2014 with a peak of about 20-25 million standard cubic meters per day. Now, the block will not produce before 2018. After the pullout of Petrobras and Statoil, ONGC, which does not have the technology to produce gas from deepsea in geologically hostile KG basin, tried to rope in other foreign energy majors but its attempts were frustrated as it could not get approvals, sources said. After the new government took over, the Oil Ministry is looking into reasons why ONGC has not started natural gas production from KG-D5, where 11 oil and gas discoveries have been made so far. In contrast, RIL's neighbouring KG-D6 block started gas output in April 2009. Shortly after the pullout by Petrobras and Statoil in 2010, the then ONGC Chairman R S Sharma had shot off an angry letter to the oil secretary saying red tape was making international oil majors apprehensive over sharing exploration risks in acreages where they pick up stake. &amp;quot;This was done by ONGC as a part of its strategy to capitalise on the technological experience of international companies of repute in the development of deepwater discoveries,&amp;quot; Sharma wrote. He stated that although the farm out agreements with Petrobras and Statoil were signed in August/September, 2007, &amp;quot;Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) could not be signed with both these companies, initially, due to 9 months taken in obtaining approval on assignment of participating interest, and then one year in signing amendment to the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) from various parties, including government.&amp;quot; ONGC has made 11 oil and gas discoveries in the Block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5. The block is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). It plans to invest USD 9 billion in producing from discoveries in NDA, sources said. ONGC is looking at producing 2.5-3 million tonnes of oil per annum and 9-10 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the Northern Development Area of KG-D5 block. NDA holds an estimated 92.30 million tonnes of oil reserves and 97.568 billion cubic metres of inplace gas reserves spread over seven fields. Sources said ONGC has submitted to the DGH a Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) for the oil find in the NDA and a detailed field development plan will be submitted by year-end. ONGC bought 90 percent interest in Block KG-D5 from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn still holds 10 percent in the block. Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area - Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna). Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries - E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1 and KT-1 in NDA and the first ultra-deepwater discovery UD-1 at a record depth of 2,841 metres. The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U, A, while the ultra deepsea UD find lies in SDA. ONGC, sources said, is looking at producing oil and gas from NDA using a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit. An investment plan for UD-1 will be submitted separately, they added."

Imported Ethane will substitute its current propane imports and a portion of naphtha used for ethylene production. &amp;quot;Given depressed US ethane prices and rising production, we estimate an annual saving of USD 450 million from this feedstock substitution from FY18,&amp;quot; CLSA said in a research report. Reliance recently announced its plans to import 1.5 million tons per annum of ethane from North America which will be used as a feedstock in its existing crackers in India. The company has executed storage and capacity agreements for liquefaction of ethane with a North American terminal and has also ordered six VLECs (Very Large Ethane Carriers) for transporting ethane to India.  Imports could start from end-2016. CLSA said: &amp;quot;While propane is a globally traded commodity, trade of ethane is a relatively new trend as it needs very low temperatures (minus 89 degrees Celsius) to be maintained.&amp;quot; Reliance's current ethylene capacity stands at about 1.9 million tons per annum. Of this, 0.8 million ton (40 percent) is gas (C2-C3) based while the remaining uses naphtha as a feedstock. &amp;quot;As per our estimate, domestic natural gas makes up about 35 percent of current feedstock for its gas based capacity with imported Propane accounting for the rest,&amp;quot; CLSA said. Reliance is also likely to convert a large portion of its 0.9 million tons naphtha based Hazira cracker into dual feed to enable acceptance of imported ethane as a feedstock. &amp;quot;Given current US ethane price of about USD 3, we estimate landed ethane price of USD 9 per million British thermal unit. Using current imported propane and naphtha price of USD 17 and 20 per mmBtu respectively, this arbitrage will reduce RIL's FY18 blended feedstock cost significantly. We estimate annual savings from FY18 of USD 450 million (USD 240 per ton) i.e. 8 percent of FY14 Ebitda,&amp;quot; CLSA said. This implies an attractive 3.3 years payback to USD 1.5 billion estimated investment on the project. The cracker will be commissioned in the second half of 2016. It will nearly double its ethylene production capacity to 3.3 million tons a year. The company has ordered six very large ethane carriers from South Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries for USD 723 million. The vessels of 87,000 cubic meters each, will be the world's first very large carriers of ethane. Disclosure: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is now part of the Reliance Group."

538,RI,2014-04-21T17:18:22+05:30,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'webtech_news18'}","Accumulate HCL Tech, Reliance Industries: Angel Broking","Angel Broking is bullish on HCL Technologies, Reliance Industries (RIL) and has recommended to accumulate both the stocks with a target price of Rs 1560 and Rs 1042 respectively in its research reports dated April 21, 2014.",,"Angel Broking, HCL Technologies, Recommendations, Reliance Industries, RIL",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/recommendations/accumulate-hcl-tech-reliance-industries-angel-broking_1072154.html,"Angel Broking's research report HCL Technologies &amp;quot;HCL Tech has recorded a ~3.4 percent CQGR in its revenue over the past eight quarters. This is primarily on the back of Infrastructure Management Services growing substantially higher than the company's average growth rate. The Management noted that growth in revenue from software services will pick up when the respective component in the large deals won recently ramps up. We believe that sustaining the run-rate of large deal wins is a healthy sign and should translate into better revenue visibility for the company in FY2015. We expect HCL Tech to post a USD and INR revenue CAGR of 12.7 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively, over FY2014&amp;amp;ndash;16E and remain watchful of the company's performance in the core software services. On the operating front, we remain skeptic on the company's ability to sustain operating margins at current levels with it going for hiring (with increase in demand) and wage hikes going ahead as attrition continues to remain sticky. We value the company at 14.5x FY2016E EPS and give it a target price of Rs 1,560. We recommend an Accumulate rating on the stock.&amp;quot; Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;(RIL) &amp;quot;For 4QFY2014, RIL's Petrochemicals and Refining segments' profit reported improvement; however, its Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment's profitability continued to decline on a yoy basis due to decline in production from its KG D6 block. Looking ahead, we expect production from the KG D6 block to increase gradually from FY2015. Moreover, higher gas prices and the recent improvement in GRMs are likely to drive earnings growth in FY2015-16. Hence, we recommend an Accumulate rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,042&amp;quot;, says Angel Broking research report.

RIL had found gas in the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 wells in October 2002 and were declared commercially viable finds between April 2003 and March 2004. It in May 2004 claimed the finds to hold 8.3 trillion cubic feet of inplace gas reserves, the CAG said in a draft audit report of KG-D6 block. Also Read: Reliance to shut refining units for maintenance in March The DGH approved a USD 2.47 billion initial development plan for the two finds by lowering the inplace reserves to 5.45 Tcf and recoverable resource to 3.81 Tcf with first gas coming in August 2006. However, before the start of commercial production, RIL in October 2006 submitted changes in the development plan by raising the capex requirement to USD 8.8 billion in two phases and putting recoverable reserves at 12.04 Tcf out of inplace volumes of 14.164 Tcf. A management committee, comprising representatives of DGH, oil ministry and the operator, in December 2006 approved the revised plan putting recoverable reserves at 10.03 Tcf and doubling of output to 80 million standard cubic metres a day. However the fields, which began production in April 2009, did not behave as predicted and output slumped within a year, forcing RIL and its new partner BP to restate the reserves at 2.9 Tcf. The CAG in the report said the production sharing contract stipulates that a contractor should submit an appraisal programme to reassess the extent of the discoveries. &amp;quot;There was no appraisal programme in respect of D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas discoveries as required under PSC. The operator moved directly from discovery to commercial discovery. &amp;quot;Appraisal programme would have enabled the operator to delineate the petroleum reservoirs to which the discovery related in terms of thickness and lateral extent besides determining the characteristics thereof and quality of recoverable petroleum therein,&amp;quot; it said in the report. The CAG said it was not clear how DGH had assured itself of the reliability of the development plan, as well as the estimates of reserves, production rates and costs in absence of the appraisal programme. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 output has fallen to about one-tenth of the 80 mmscmd production that RIL had estimated for this time. &amp;quot;It is not clear how DGH had ensured accuracy and realistic nature of the data before agreeing to the approval of Addendum to the Initial Development Plan (AIDP),&amp;quot; the auditor said. The CAG has sought comments of the Oil Ministry on its draft report before finalising a Performance Audit report."

While India is surplus in petroleum products, production of LPG in the country is lower than the demand. The deficit is met through imports which have to increased if any of 20 refiners in the country produces less than projected LPG. Sources said modern refineries have flexibility of changing product slate and often LPG production is pushed down in favour of high value petrol and diesel. Change in production profiles of refineries especially private sector units, has in the past led to LPG scarcity and the resultant delays in delivery of domestic cooking gas. To tide over this, the Oil Ministry last month sought law ministry's opinion if the government can under the Essential Commodities Act of 1955 ask both public and private sector oil refineries to produce a certain volumes. Sources said the Law Ministry in its opinion has stated that petroleum and petroleum products are among the essential commodities defined under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Section 3(1) of the Act empowerd the Union government to provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution of essential commodity and trade for maintaining or increasing supply of any essential&amp;amp;nbsp; ommodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability. Also read: ATF price hiked by 1%, non-subsidised LPG rate cut by Rs 53 The government, the law ministry opinion said, can issue an order for LPG under Section 3(1). &amp;quot;In view of the above provision of the Act it appears that the Central government may by an order under the (Essential Commodities) Act mandate a minimum percentage of LPG production from all the refineries,&amp;quot; it said. Against a projected demand of 16.5 million tonnes, indigenous availabilty of LPG is only 10.4 million tonnes during the current fiscal. The remaining 6.5 million tonnes is being met through imports. Sources said while petrol production by refineries has risen by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9 percent in five years beginning 2007-08, CAGR in LPG production was only 1.5 percent. Diesel too has shown a CAGR of 7.2 percent. Government has drawn an ambitious target of increasing LPG penetration in the country to 75 percent of the population by releasing 5.5 crore new connections by 2015. Focus of Vision 2015 is to extend the usage of LPG for cooking purposes in rural/under- served areas so that standard of life in rural areas improves by switching from kerosene or firewood to environmental friendly fuel, they said. To achieve this, domestic production has to increase, they added. Presently, 16.24 crore domestic LPG connections cover about 62 percent of the population."

BP and Niko further stated that as a contractor to the PSC they are party to the arbitration and RIL has represented them as per the PSC and JOA, sources said. Sources said the technicalities of submission of bank guarantee had been used by the Oil Ministry in not announcing the new price that will be applicable from April 1. On January 10 the ministry had notified that all domestically produced natural gas will be priced at an average of international hub rates and price at which India imports gas in its liquid form (LNG). Also, BP and Niko had previously submitted that the decision of the tribunal on gas output issue would be binding on both of them."

Mukesh Ambani-led RIL had sought the reversal of 1,383.68 acres - from Reliance Haryana SEZ Ltd (RHSL) to the Haryana State Industrial &amp;amp;amp; Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) - saying that the project had become unviable. An official release said the SEZ Project at Gurgaon had &amp;quot;been rendered economically unviable due to the mid-term corrections in the SEZ Policy viz. imposition of the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), withdrawal of the Tax holiday, slowdown in the global economy, prohibitively high prices of land and other problems associated with aggregation of land through private negotiations&amp;quot;. Sensing the difficulties posed in this behalf, the Chief Minister had requested Reliance to return the HSIIDC land, it said. &amp;quot;As such, RHSL offered to return the HSIIDC land and abandon the SEZ project in Gurgaon vide their letter of January 2012,&amp;quot; the release said. &amp;quot;RHSL had requested for refund of the amount paid by them to the HSIIDC and re-imbursement of expenditure incurred on the site, apart from interest on the said amount aggregating to Rs. 1,172 crore,&amp;quot; it added. The proposal was considered at the level of the Haryana Investment Promotion Board, headed by the Chief Minister, after examining all the legal aspects of the Joint Venture Agreement, it said, adding that HIPB recommended acceptance of the return offer strictly in accordance with the provisions of the JV agreement. &amp;quot;Accordingly, the Haryana Cabinet&amp;amp;nbsp;Saturday approved the return of the land to HSIIDC, in lieu of payment of an amount of Rs. 343.51 crore to RHSL as against Rs. 399.85 crore paid by RHSL at the time of transfer of land and the demand of Rs. 1,172 crore by RHSL,&amp;quot; the order noted. &amp;quot;The claims on account of Administrative charges forming price of the subject, refund of the Stamp Duty, re-imbursement of development expenditure and interest amount have not been accepted. The refund amount has been worked out strictly as per the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement date 19th June 2006 signed between the HSIIDC and RVL.&amp;quot; HSIIDC and Reliance Ventures Ltd, wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, had entered into a JV Agreement on June 19, 2006 for setting up of the SEZ over an area of 25,000 acres in Gurgaon and Jhajjar districts. HSIIDC had transferred about 1,383.68 acres at Village Garhi Harsaru to the special purpose vehicle floated by HSIIDC and RVL for implementing the project - Reliance Haryana SEZ Ltd, for about Rs.399.85 crore. The project configuration was subsequently changed to SEZ in Gurgaon district over 12,500 acres and a Model Economic Township over 12,500 acres in Jhajjar district. Reliance was able to purchase, and aggregate, about 7,100 acres in Jhajjar, and another about 1200 acres in Gurgaon, but it was not contiguous. RHSL also paid Annuity to the landowners whose land was acquired/procured in Gurgaon &amp;amp;amp; Jhajjar amounting to Rs. 50.71 crore up to March 31, 2013. It included Rs. 17.61 crore on HSIIDC land in Gurgaon and balance amount of about Rs. 33.10 crore in Jhajjar where they had procured land through direct negotiations. Soon after the Haryana government received the land return offer from RHSL, it has been engaged in discussions with the Union Ministry of Commerce &amp;amp;amp; Industry for the best utilisation of the subject land, the release said. &amp;quot;It has been agreed with the Ministry of Commerce &amp;amp;amp; Industry to use the subject land for establishment of a state of the art Global City Project as a send investment node under the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) Project,&amp;quot; it further said. &amp;quot;The Global City is envisaged to be developed as a high value added manufacturing infused area which, apart from adding to the economic development, would also help in generating skilled employment in Haryana.&amp;quot; Mr Hooda said the land acquired for the Reliance project would not be returned to the original owners of the land. The new project is envisaged to be an integrated model township in Gurgaon, comprising of the exhibition and convention centre, high value innovation and knowledge industries, central business district and township facilities.

This makes Sinha only the second Sebi chief after DR Mehta to be heading the regulatory body over three years. Sinha took over the Sebi reins in February 2011, succeeding CB Bhave. Before being appointed the boss, he was the Chairman and Managing Director of UTI Mutual Fund. Credited with an effort, sometimes acting tough, to bring more transparency to stock markets, we take a look back at this career bureaucrat&amp;amp;rsquo;s tenure as the Sebi chief. *After taking his office, Sinha introduced rules to improve corporate governance and disclosure standards. *Under his regime, Sinha unveiled reforms like change in policies for mutual funds (MFs) and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) * Sebi became tough on new fund launches. The regulator said it would not allow asset managers to launch funds if their existing portfolio includes a fund with same or similar strategy. At a public event Sinha had said that Sebi does not want &amp;amp;ldquo;new funds unless they have a separate (different) style of investment&amp;amp;rdquo;. *During his tenure, Sebi also came up with new rules aimed at curbing improper selling by distributors. *In 2009, Sebi had banned fund houses from charging entry load from new investors and had put curbs on the exit load. This hit the asset management industry. However, Sinha allowed MFs to charge additional fees from existing investors. *In order to attract more foreign investors and fund flow, Sebi unified the investment route by FIIs and qualified foreign investors by unveiling a uniform entry norm. *Under Sinha, Sebi asked for special powers for investigations and enforcement by the government. The finance ministry has sought law ministry&amp;amp;rsquo;s opinion regarding re-promulgation of the Sebi ordinance. The ordinance authorises Sebi chairman to investigate, conduct search and seizure under the Sebi Act and crack down on Ponzi schemes. *Sinha found himself entangled in controversy. In 2011, Former Sebi board member KM Abraham had alleged that the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, his officer of special duty (OSD) Omita Paul and Sebi chief UK Sinha had pressured Abraham to go easy against some corporate interests, including the Sahara Group, Reliance, and MCX. However, the finance ministry rejected Abraham&amp;amp;rsquo;s allegations claiming it to be &amp;amp;ldquo;defamatory, devoid of any truth and are a complete distortion of facts&amp;amp;rdquo;. *Currently Sebi is fighting some high profile legal cases like &amp;amp;ndash; Subrata Roy (Sahara case),&amp;amp;nbsp;Reliance Industries (Mukesh Ambani),&amp;amp;nbsp;Financial Technologies (Jignesh Shah) &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;"

Fuel retailing in India is permitted to companies who have invested Rs 2,000 crore in oil and gas infrastructure in the country.&amp;quot;They are entitled to it (retailing license) and they will get this entitlement,&amp;quot; Rae said. A BP spokesperson confirmed BP's intent to enter into the aviation business through the company's subsidiary, Air BP. &amp;quot;Air BP, our global aviation services division continues to grow in new locations. As part of this growth, we plan to expand our footprint into material emerging markets in the world, including India. With that long term intent, we would like to secure a license to market ATF in India,&amp;quot; the spokesperson added.BP, the spokesperson said, was not interested in auto fuel retailing (setting up petrol pumps) in the country. &amp;quot;BP's potential entry in retail fuel marketing is entirely speculative. We have no such plans at the moment.&amp;quot;Rae said ATF sale is a deregulated sector and any company which is able to tie-up logistics can enter the sector. While jet fuel bunkering at most of the airports in the country are owned and controlled by state-owned firms, the refueling infrastructure at new airports being built by private firms is bid out and allows third party access to the infrastructure. &amp;quot;BP can either buy ATF from local refineries like Reliance Industries or can import. That is not an issue,&amp;quot; Rae said.The third party access to the storage and refueling infrastructure at the airports would allow BP access but the challenge would be to arrange for logistics to carry the fuel from refinery or port of import to the airport because unlike state-owned firms, BP does not own pipelines to transport it.India had in 2002 allowed private companies entry into fuel retailing subject to the minimum investment criteria. Reliance Industries,&amp;amp;nbsp;Essar Oil and Royal Dutch Shell got licenses and opened petrol pumps. However, RIL shut pumps and other companies went slow on expansion as government gave huge subsidised to state-owned firms, practically making it impossible for private companies to compete. BP in 2011 agreed to acquire a 30 percent stake in blocks operated by Reliance Industries for &amp;amp;#36;7 billion. The UK-based energy firm has also formed a 50:50 joint venture with Reliance for sourcing and marketing gas."

However in petchem, it is too early to expect a sustained recovery in petchem margins. In the case of petchem, demand remains a concern. Any weakness in demand could impact a sustained margin recovery. We maintain our weak outlook on the refining cycle for the near term on the back of a higher incremental new capacity compared to incremental demand. The incremental net refining capacity additions are expected to be 1.7mbpd in the current year as against demand growth of 1mbpd. Gas production from the KG basin is expected to increase in the coming quarters from MA field (D26; part of KGD6). However, incremental production from other fields, mainly Rseries, Satellite Field, etc. is expected by 2015-16, but would be subject to approval of terms and conditions of the bank guarantee.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Although a positive government stance on RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s E&amp;amp;amp;P efforts in terms of project approvals and gas pricing approval augurs well for the company. We remain cautious about RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s refining and petchem margins for the near term, due to new capacities and/or weakening demand. However, with the expected improvement in RIL&amp;amp;rsquo;s business profile in the next 2 years, potential upsides from positive developments in E&amp;amp;amp;P and attractive valuations, we maintain an Accumulate rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 982.

Wipro remains confident of improving revenue growth trajectory ahead driven by a better demand environment, a healthy deal pipeline across multiple verticals as well as Infra Services (hitherto an area of strength, however company was lagging peers on growth here through the past 2 years).&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We tweak our FY15/16E earnings higher by 4/7 percent higher to Rs 38/41 respectively driven largely by higher revenue/margin assumptions (refer table below). Valuations remain attractive given improving operating performance (read revenue growth trajectory). We raise TP to Rs 615 (V/s Rs 550 earlier), based on 15x FY16E earnings. Wipro remains our 2nd most preferred bet in the Tier I space after Infosys. Accumulate the stock.&amp;quot; HDFC Bank &amp;quot;HDFC Bank, we are quite cognizant of the fact that the growth in the operating revenues for HDFCB has decelerated materially, 16 percent yoy for M9FY14 vs. 18-25 percent in FY12-13. However, the core operating profit has grown by 24 percent for M9FY14 vs. 15-22 percent in FY12-13. And hence, we aren&amp;amp;rsquo;t unduly worried about few basis points drop in NIMs as notwithstanding the same, the RoAs have remain superior at 1.8-1.9 percent (in fact topped at 2.1 percent for Q3FY14).&amp;quot; &amp;quot;HDFC Bank commands valuation premium over its peers owing to its a) ability towards healthy loan growth and across all segment ie retail and corporate b) NIM at 4 percent+ levels c) stable asset quality with healthy PCR and d) adequate capital for growth with superior return ratios.

The quarterly net revenues stood at Rs 1.03 lakh crore, up 10 percent year-on-year.&amp;amp;nbsp;Brokerage house Antique has maintained a &amp;amp;lsquo;hold&amp;amp;rsquo; on Reliance Industries but revised its target price higher. &amp;amp;ldquo;We slightly revise our SOTP-based target price up from Rs 940 to Rs 950 assuming a weaker rupee.

He was scheduled to participate in a session on 'Eurasia: The Next Frontier?' at WEF, and was also expected to hold a number of private meetings on the sidelines. These meetings would have been significant as it was to be Sharif's first outing to such a large global business summit ever since he won an historic election in Pakistan last year.

However, both of them are expected to be separately attending a number of private meetings with businessmen and political leaders from across the world, which assume significance in the wake of overseas revenues accounting for a bulk of the respective top-lines of their groups. The two top Indian industrialists are expected to come face to face also at a number of dinners and receptions hosted on the sidelines of WEF summit, including one hosted by Mistry himself on behalf of his group's IT arm TCS and an India Reception by industry body CII.&amp;amp;nbsp; While nearly 40 heads of state and more than 1500 global CEOs are scheduled to be present, some big names are absent from the final list. These include chiefs of technology giants like Microsoft (although founder Bill Gates is present), Google, Facebook and Apple, but Yahoo's young CEO Marissa Mayer is one of the co-chairs alongwith Infosys' Kris Gopalakrishnan. Vodafone chief is also not here, although heads of PepsiCo, Coca Cola, Wal-Mart and ArcelorMittal are expected to be here. Once a regular, Citibank's former CEO Vikram Pandit is also missing, while his successor and incumbent chief of global banking giant Mike Corbat has also given this summit a miss. As yet, more than 100 business leaders from India are expected to be present, along with five union ministers -- P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma, Kamal Nath, Praful Patel and Jyotiraditya Scindia -- and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

With Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily approving of the remedial measures that were pending for nearly 18 months, RIL-BP last week added the first production well on the block in more than four years to ramp up output by over 15% to 13.7 million standard cubic metres per day. Also Read:&amp;amp;nbsp;RIL, BP to give &amp;amp;#36;1.2 bn bank guarantee for higher gas price This well, which will add up to two mmmscmd to the output, as well as water pluggings adding smaller volumes, could have come a year back and averted complete stoppage of gas supplies to power plants. BP India head Sashi Mukundan said the two partners are currently attempting to cut off water ingress into three wells on the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas fields and if successful will do the same on a similar number of wells in 2015. In between, they will also install a compressor at the onshore terminal to pull the gas up from the wells that are over a kilometre below the sea. On MA field, also in KG-D6 block, RIL-BP added the MA-8 well on January 2 and plan to do drill a branch well (called side tracking) later this year by re-entering a shut well. He said, &amp;quot;this is part of the next phase of producing the gas in the MA field after the oil has been produced&amp;quot;. A similar side-track well is planned on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 in 2015 and another one may be looked at on MA in 2015 if the results of the one planned this year is successful, he said. &amp;quot;We are currently doing water shut-off (WSO) job on three wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas fields before we install a compressor in first half of 2015,&amp;quot; he said. The KG-D6 fields had scaled to become India's largest producing gas fields in March 2010 but in less than a year it witnessed unanticipated water and sand ingress shutting down well after well. BP, which bought 30% stake in KG-D6 and 20 other blocks of RIL for USD 7.2 billion, flew in a number of experts from its worldwide operations and on its part RIL experts engaged at BP's deep water technical facilities in Sunbury, UK and in Houston, Texas to look for remedies. The situation demanded immediate interventions like re-entry into the water flooded wells to plug seepage and install compressor that could pump out the gas. However, approvals for the remedial actions which otherwise should have come as part of routine annual budgets, were blocks by both the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons and the Oil Ministry over a dispute about CAG auditing RIL accounts. This resulted in the shut-in of more wells. With 10 out of the 18 wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 shutting down and a third of the six on MA closed due to water and sand ingress, there appeared on the horizon a situation where systems would shutdown if just a tenth of the gas flowed in a design capacity of 80 mmscmd. &amp;quot;RIL as operator with the support of BP experts have worked very hard to avert a shutdown,&amp;quot; he said."

The well has potential to produce 1 million to 2 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas from the well and the output is expected to stabilise by the middle of the month, the Reliance official said. Reliance is currently producing about 10 mscmd gas from the KG D6 block, sharply lower from the 60 mscmd production at the end of 2010. Reliance and partner BP have cited geological complexities for the fall in output but the oil regulator believes they have failed to drill enough wells. Falling output had already prompted the government to disallow proportionate cost recovery to Reliance, leading to arbitration proceedings over the issue. Last month, India allowed Reliance to charge higher prices for gas from April only after the company offered financial guarantees to the government to settle any claims against it over a shortfall in its gas output."

The SAT concluded the hearing on the matter under which RIL challenged Sebi's decision to take the case out of the consent mechanism process saying the amount involved is too large. Also read: Insider trading laws difficult, India no exception: Expert Senior RIL counsel Janak Dwarkadas requested Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) to ask the Sebi to fix a time-table for hearing the consent application once again. The consent mechanism allows companies and individuals to settle their disputes with the Sebi by paying a sum without admission or denial of the alleged wrongdoing, but disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains. The matter dates back to 2007, when RIL, prior to the merger of Reliance Petroleum with itself, allegedly short-sold 4.1 per cent stake in RPL valued at Rs 4,023 crore to prevent a slump in the stock. The RPL shares were sold first in the futures market and later in the spot market, covering the share sales in the futures market, it was alleged. In 2008, Sebi initiated a probe into the matter and in 2010 initiated quasi-judicial proceedings and said it had found that RIL had booked a profit of Rs 513 crore in the futures segment through this deal worth Rs 4,023 crore. The Sebi argued that the company was aware of the sale of shares and sold futures ahead of that, therefore amounting to insider-trading and sent a show-cause notice to the company. RIL had challenged the Sebi show-cause notice in December 2010. Following this, Sebi ordered a probe and found that RIL had violated insider-trading norms. Though RIL moved Sebi for consent settlement, the regulator did not entertain the application, forcing RIL to move the SAT. Arguing RIL's case, Dwarkadas today asked, &amp;quot;What is the difficulty if Sebi now fixes a meeting of the internal committee and decides on the consent application, now that the inspection of documents is finally over.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sebi can reject our application, but at least they should hear us out,&amp;quot; Dwarkadas argued. He also claimed that Sebi was wrong in saying that RIL's application could not be dealt with under the new consent mechanism, saying the company was clearly told on April 15, 2011 that it could apply for a settlement via consent. In response to the RIL charges and demand, senior Sebi counsel Darius Khambata said, &amp;quot;Sebi cannot be compelled to settle a case through consent as the consent norms are administrative guidelines and cannot be challenged in court.&amp;quot; To substantiate his argument, Khambata cited a Bombay High Court order in favour of Sebi in a similar case involving Shilpa Stock Brokers. Khambata also said the consent norms do not give an entity the right to ask Sebi to take up its case for settlement. &amp;quot;It's absolutely Sebi's discretion to take a call and it can refuse to settle a case under consent anytime in public interest,&amp;quot; Khambata said. In May 2012, Sebi tightened the norms for settlement through the consent framework. As a result, many cases, including those related to insider trading, are not being settled through this mechanism."

RIL and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources have spud the seventh well on the MA oil and gas field in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin. The well, MA-8, is likely to be put on production this month, sources with direct knowledge of the development said. MA-8 is projected to produce a minimum of 1 mmscmd and a maximum of 3 mmscmd, they said. Also read: Reliance likely to surge in 2014; cautious on retail: HDFC At 3 mmscmd, MA-8 will be RIL's biggest gas producer well on KG-D6 currently. Production at KG-D6 has dropped to just about 12 mmscmd and MA-8 will help reverse the falling trend of last three years. The current output is made up of about 8.5 mmscmd from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) gas field and about 3.3 mmscmd from the MA field in the same block. Sources said RIL is also repairing a third of the wells shut at its main D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 gas field to boost output by March. RIL had to shut 10 out of the 18 producing wells on D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 due to sand and water flooding. It had also shut two of the six wells at the MA field due to high water and sand ingress. MA-8 will be the seventh well on the field. The KG-D6 fields, which began gas production in April 2009, hit a peak output of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down well after well. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, the largest of the 18 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block, produced 66.35 mmscmd, while 3.07 mmscmd was the output from the MA field, the only oil discovery on the block. Besides the fall in output from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3, gas production from the MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, has dropped. Of the current gas production from KG-D6, 11.7 mmscmd was sold to urea manufacturing fertiliser plants and the remaining consumed by the pipeline that transports the KG-D6 gas, sources said. The company has so far made 18 gas and one oil discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin block in Bay of Bengal. While the lone oil find, MA went on stream in September 2008, D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 were put on production in April 2009."
