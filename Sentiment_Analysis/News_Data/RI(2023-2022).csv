From the PSU basket, &amp;quot;REC has witnessed the breakout of Rs 127 level after 4 years of failed attempts, so we can expect good momentum. We can expect an immediate target of Rs 138, while Rs 150 is the next target, and Rs 125 should be your stop-loss,&amp;quot; he says. On Rail Vikas Nigam which has already witnessed a big run-up, Meena, who has more than 10 years of experience in the financial markets with expertise in technical and derivative analysis, says as of now it seems that the stock may see one more leg of the upmove towards Rs 120 before the momentum cools off. Therefore, traders should follow a trailing stop-loss approach where Rs 99 is an immediate stop-loss, he advises.  Is it looking like a sustainable rally for the Nifty50?  The Nifty has been in a structural upswing since March 2020, with a healthy time-wise correction lasting more than 1.5 years. Now that Nifty has broken the structure of lower highs and lower lows and started a structure of higher highs and higher lows. There are signals that Nifty is prepared for a new expansion phase. The bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders formation has a breakout, which could aid in the Nifty regaining its prior record high of 18,888. After a big advance in April, there may be some retreat or consolidation but any dip will be an excellent buying opportunity. On the downside, 17,800 serves as an immediate support level, and the range between 17,500 and 17,400 has turned into a floor.  If it is a sustainable rally, which are the sectors that could drive the northward journey?  The leader of this bull run is Bank Nifty, and we believe the leadership will remain intact. However, the Reliance Industries chart is looking very lucrative, which may help the Nifty head towards its all-time high. The capital goods segment is clearly one of the strongest sectors, and L&amp;amp;amp;T may continue to do well. My eye will be on PSU stocks because on Friday, the Nifty PSE index hits a fresh all-time high after January 2008. So there is a clear breakout after about 15 years. And last week, we saw a lot of activity in many PSU stocks.  Your top three picks for this week and why?  From the largecap space, Reliance Industries will be my top pick, which is witnessing a breakout of bullish Inverse Head and Shoulder formation. In Reliance, we can expect an immediate target of Rs 2,460, and Rs 2,530 as the next target level while Rs 2,360 should be your stop-loss. From the PSU basket, REC has witnessed the breakout of the Rs 127 level after 4 years of failed attempts, so we can expect good momentum. We can expect an immediate target of Rs 138, while Rs 150 is the next target, and Rs 125 should be your stop-loss. Info Edge (Naukri) is another counter that is bottoming out with the classic Inverse Head and Shoulder formation. While Rs 4,000 and Rs 4,200 are imminent targets, Rs 3,700 should be your stop-loss.  Is Rail Vikas Nigam looking overbought now after a stellar run of over 35 percent?  As I said, we are very bullish on the PSU space; however, Rail Vikas Nigam has already witnessed a big run-up, so we may see some consolidation or pullback. As of now, it seems that we may see one more leg of the upmove towards Rs 120 before the momentum cools off; therefore, traders should follow a trailing stop-loss approach where Rs 99 is an immediate stop-loss.  Is Ipca Laboratories looking oversold after a sharp fall last week?  Ipca Labs underperformed the Nifty Pharma index and witnessed a sharp fall. It has become oversold in the near term; therefore, we may see some consolidation or base-building process around Rs 700 level but traders should wait for confirmation of any kind of reversal.  Do you think 26,000 is really the bottom for the Nifty IT index because in the past also it tested the same levels multiple times?   The Nifty IT index had six months of consolidation around the 26,000 level in 2021, then witnessed a big rally before it topped out. Now this 26,000 level is acting as a strong base. However, it is too early to say whether it has bottomed out or not because next quarter will be important in terms of earnings because of the real impact of the banking crisis and the US slowdown. Technically, it has to cross the psychological level of 30,000 for any trend reversal.

Reliance Industries&nbsp;reported a net profit, attributable to the owners of the company, at Rs 19,299 crore for the March quarter of the financial year 2022-23, up 19 percent from the year-ago period. The profit beat estimates driven by a strong performance across businesses.  Gross revenue from operations of the country's most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.  The bottomline of the company was expected to grow in single digit year-on-year (YoY)&nbsp;as analysts estimated an average net profit of Rs 16,573 crore.  EBITDA increased by 21.8 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 41,389 crore.

The report notes that the EBITDA beat estimates, led by its O2C and Jio segments, while its retail segment was slightly lower. The report mentions that Reliance's retail space expansion should aid a 30&nbsp;percent EBITDA CAGR, but the company's capex was elevated.  The report also notes that Jio generated healthy FCF and that its elevated 5G capex could possibly open up the next leg of growth. While recent softness in refining margin, could reverse with healthy US demand and China reopening.  The valuation is favourable, though net debt rose. However, management has allayed leverage concerns.  Morgan Stanley  The energy segment drove the Q4 EBITDA beat as chemical and refining margins recovered and gas costs declined. The report also suggests that store expansion was key to growth in retail, and the EBITDA was in line.  The profit beat of 18 percent was driven by a lower tax rate, and net debt was flat quarter-over-quarter. Notably, the company mentioned for the first time that it plans to maintain its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 1.

Using SOTP, they value the Refining and Petrochemical segments at 7.5x EV/EBITDA, arriving at a valuation of Rs 879/share for standalone business.  It ascribe an equity valuation of Rs 800&nbsp;per share to RJio and Rs 1,354&nbsp;per share to Reliance Retail, factoring in the recent stake sale. It reiterated the 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 2,800.  JPMorgan&nbsp;  The research firm has kept 'overweight' rating with a target of Rs 2,960 per share. The O2C drove a large PAT beat and that O2C and E&amp;amp;amp;P are expected to drive FY24 earnings.  The capex/debt commentary is positive and welcomes the company's comments on disciplined capital allocation and maintaining net debt/EBITDA below 1x. The report believes that this should assuage investor concerns on leverage.  However, a relentless FII sell-down remains a key near-term headwind for the stock.  Kotak Institutional Equities   Kotak Institutional Equities keeps 'buy' rating and a target of Rs 2,800 per share. The report notes that the Q4 consolidated EBITDA was 5&nbsp;percent ahead of estimates, with the beat mainly due to O2C. Digital services fared well, while retail and E&amp;amp;amp;P were marginally below expectations.  The firm&nbsp;suggests that a strong petrochemical recovery should cushion O2C earnings, and capex further rose to Rs 44,400 crore in Q4. However, reported net debt was flat quarter-over-quarter. It&nbsp;believes that with 5G capex likely peaking soon, and believes that net debt has likely peaked.  CLSA   The brokerage house maintained the 'buy' rating on the stock with a target of Rs 2,970 per share. The Q4 consolidated PAT was ahead of estimates, helped by a notably lower-than-expected tax rate. Consolidated EBITDA was 1 percent ahead of estimates, with a 7 percent miss in retail EBITDA offset by a beat in O2C, while Jio had an in-line quarter.  It was another quarter of big expansion for retail in Q4, implying a huge 58 percent rise in retail selling space in FY23. However, for FY23, FCF dipped to negative driven by a large capex of $17 billion led by retail and telecom. The broking firm raises the 24/25 EPS estimates by 3 percent/4 percent.  Goldman Sachs   The brokerage house has kept the 'buy' rating on the stock with a target of Rs 2,890 per share. The Q4 EBITDA was largely in line with expectations, while net profit was 11 percent below estimates due to higher-than-expected depreciation. The interest expense was largely in line.  Sequential earnings growth was led by the O2C segment on stronger GRMs, and falling petchem earnings turned into a tailwind with the correction in feedstock US ethane and LPG.  The firm noted that retail continued to gain market share, with grocery revenue driven by rapid store expansion.  The capex rose to $17.6 billion in FY23 but was fully funded by cash profits. The net debt to EBITDA is well below 1x in FY23.  Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

As a result, bottomline growth came in strong at double-digits, compared to the year-ago period. Lower tax costs too helped.  Here are key highlights of the quarter as well as full-year earnings:  1) Profit  Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltd has recorded a&nbsp;19.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated profit at Rs&nbsp;19,299 crore for the quarter ended March of the financial year 2022-23. A 36.5 percent fall in tax cost YoY to Rs 2,787 crore due to lower deferred tax for the quarter helped.  2) Revenue  Gross revenue for the quarter at Rs 2.39 lakh crore grew by 2.8 percent, compared to the corresponding period last fiscal with continuing growth momentum in consumer businesses.  &amp;quot;The digital services segment achieved 15.4 percent YoY growth, while the retail segment grew by 19.4 percent in the same period,&amp;quot; Reliance said in its release.  The company further said its revenue from the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment doubled YoY on account of higher price realisations. However, &amp;quot;this was partially offset by decrease in revenue from O2C business on account of sharp decrease in crude oil prices and lower price realisation on downstream products&amp;quot;.  3) Operating performance  The operating performance remained strong for the quarter gone by, driven by all key segments. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by&nbsp;21.8 percent on-year to Rs&nbsp;41,389 crore.  Click Here to Read All Earnings Related News  EBITDA was driven by higher revenue and increase in margins in the digital services segment, and favourable mix, sourcing benefits and operating efficiencies in the retail segment, Reliance said in its filing to the exchanges.  Higher transportation fuel cracks and optimised feedstock cost, partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins in the O2C segment, and better gas price realisation and higher volumes in the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment also boosted operating performance for the quarter.  4) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms recorded 15.6 percent YoY growth in profit at Rs 4,984 crore for quarter ended March FY23, driven by lower finance cost as well as double-digit growth in topline and operating performance.  &amp;quot;Revenue from operations increased by 14.4 percent YoY, driven by sustained increase in subscriber base for the connectivity business, and strong EBITDA growth of 16.9 percent is led by higher revenue and increase in margins,&amp;quot; the company said.  The Jio subscriber base at the end of March FY23 was 43.93 crore, growing 7.1 percent over the 41.02 crore subscribers at the end of March FY22, while the average revenue per user (ARPU) grew by 6.7 percent on-year to Rs 178.8 per subscriber per month due to impact of tariff hike, better subscriber mix, and data add-ons within select customer cohorts.  ARPU in the December FY23 quarter was Rs 178.2.  &amp;quot;With steady growth in mobility and FTTH subscriber base and an expanding bouquet of content and digital services, the Jio business continues to deliver impressive growth in operating profits,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, said.  5) Reliance Retail  Ambani further said the retail business registered excellent growth numbers, backed by expansion of physical and digital footprint and a significant increase in footfall.  The retail business delivered 12.9 percent year-on-year growth in profit at Rs 2,415 crore for the quarter with a massive 33 percent YoY growth in EBITDA.  Revenue from the segment increased 21 percent YoY during the quarter, led by growth in grocery, consumer electronics and fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle segments, with the number of stores at 18,040 growing 18.7 percent over the year-ago period.  Reliance Retail registered a whopping 41.3 percent on-year growth in footfalls in the quartering ending March of FY23.  6) Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C)  The O2C business recorded a 14.4 percent YoY growth in EBITDA in the March quarter, with margin expansion of 290 bps, led by strength in transportation fuel cracks, optimised feedstock cost, and advantageous ethane cracking economics. This was partially offset by lower polyester chain margins.  The special additional excise duty (SAED) on transportation fuels adversely impacted its earnings by Rs 711 crore.  &amp;quot;The O2C segment posted its highest-ever operating profit despite global uncertainties and disruptions in commodity trade flows,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  Revenue from this segment declined by 11.8 percent YoY primarily on account of sharp reduction in crude oil prices and lower price realisation of downstream products, while total throughput increased by 2.6 percent YoY.  7) Oil &amp;amp;amp; gas exploration  Reliance's oil &amp;amp;amp; gas exploration and production business recorded a massive 144.3 percent on-year growth in EBITDA with margin at 83.4 percent, expanding by 60 bps compared to the year-ago period.  The higher price realisation and 13 percent increase in KG D6 gas production also helped the company report a whopping 127 percent YoY growth for the quarter, while KG D6 production increased by 13.8 percent YoY to 42.9 billions of cubic feet equivalent (bcfe).  &amp;quot;The average price realised for KG D6 is $11.39 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBTU) in Q4FY23 against $6.13 per MMBTU in Q4FY22, while the average price realised for CBM is $19.57 per MMBTU against $7.638 per MMBTU in the same quarter last year,&amp;quot; the company said.  8) FY23 growth  The country's largest firm by market capitalisation has registered a&nbsp;9.9 percent growth in its consolidated profit at Rs&nbsp;66,702 crore for financial year ended March 2023.  The introduction of SAED on transportation fuels adversely impacted earnings by Rs 6,648 crore on full-year basis, Reliance said.  The numbers remained robust for the year, with EBITDA growing&nbsp;23.1 percent to Rs&nbsp;1.54 lakh crore and revenue increasing by&nbsp;23.2&nbsp;percent to Rs&nbsp;9.76 lakh crore compared to the previous fiscal.  &amp;quot;The digital services segment achieved 19.6 percent growth during the year, while retail business grew by 30.4 percent over the previous year,&amp;quot; the company said.  The firm further said revenue of the O2C business improved by 18.7 percent, led by higher realisations on the back of 19 percent increase in average Brent crude price, while the oil and gas business revenue increased 120.3 percent due to a sharp increase in gas price realisation and 10.7 percent increase in KG D6 gas production.  9) Financial services subsidiary  This year Reliance has proposed to demerge the financial services arm and list the new entity &lsquo;Jio Financial Services Ltd&rsquo;.  &amp;quot;This gives our shareholders an opportunity to participate in an exciting new growth platform from inception,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  10) Net debt and cash  Reliance said the net debt at the end of March FY23 was Rs 1.1 lakh crore, of which outstanding debt and cash &amp;amp;amp; cash equivalents were Rs 3.14 lakh crore and Rs 2.04 lakh crore, respectively.  The outstanding debt at the end of the previous financial year was Rs 2.66 lakh crore, and cash and cash equivalents were Rs 2.31 lakh crore.  The capital expenditure for the year was Rs 1.41 lakh crore.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The profit beat estimates driven by a strong performance across businesses.  Gross revenue from operations of India's&nbsp;most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.  The bottom line of the Mukesh Ambani-led company was expected to grow in single digits year-on-year (YoY). Analysts estimated Reliance Industries&nbsp; to post an average net profit of Rs 16,573 crore.  EBITDA increased by 21.8 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 41,389 crore on account of higher revenue and increase in margins in the digital services segment, the company said in a release.&nbsp; Sourcing benefits and operating efficiencies in the retail segment also helped. Higher transportation fuel cracks and optimised feedstock cost were partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins in Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) segment.  &ldquo;O2C segment posted its highest-ever operating profit despite global uncertainties and disruptions in commodity trade flows. Our oil and gas segment also delivered very strong growth and is now poised to contribute nearly 30 percent of India&rsquo;s domestic gas production,&rdquo; said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries.  RIL also witnessed better gas price realization and higher volumes in the oil and gas segment.  &ldquo;I am happy to note Reliance&rsquo;s initiatives in digital connectivity and organized retail are driving greater efficiencies in the economy and contributing to India&rsquo;s emergence as one of the fastest growing economies in the world,&rdquo; said Ambani.  &ldquo;This year we have proposed to demerge our financial services arm and list the new entity &ldquo;Jio Financial Services Ltd. This gives our shareholders an opportunity to participate in an exciting new growth platform from inception.&rdquo;  Capital expenditure in FY23 was at Rs 1.41 lakh crore, and net debt as of 31st March 2023 stood at Rs 1.10 lakh crore. Venkatachari Srikanth, chief financial officer for the company, said the increase in net debt was due to working capital and translation impact on foreign currency liabilities. He further added that internal accruals would continue to fund the company&rsquo;s growth plans, as seen over the last two years, where cash profits had covered 98 percent of the capital expenditure. &ldquo;The emphasis remains on discipline in capital allocation to support growth initiatives. We believe that it will be largely funded through internal accruals,&rdquo; he said.  Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms' profit for the quarter came in at Rs 4,984 crore, up 15.6 percent. Revenue from operations for the company, which houses Reliance's telecom and streaming businesses, increased 14.4 percent YoY to Rs 25,465 crore.  Revenue from operations increased primarily driven by a sustained increase in subscriber base for the connectivity business while strong EBITDA growth was led by higher revenue and increase in margins.  Average revenue per user (ARPU), an important metric to measure the performance of telecom companies, also improved 6.7 percent YoY to Rs 178.8 per user per month. Quarter on quarter it improved by 60 paise per user.  &amp;quot;Jio has taken formidable strides in pioneering 5G rollout across the country with unmatched speed of execution,&amp;quot; said Akash M Ambani, chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited.  This has led to a significant improvement in customer experience, reflected in the higher engagement levels among Jio users. &amp;quot;Jio remains committed to build a robust digital society with tailormade technology platforms which will drive sustained growth in earning and value for all stakeholders,&amp;quot; he added.  Also Read: Reliance Jio FY23 EBITDA up a solid 24.2% on strong revenue growth of 17.9%  Retail Business  Reliance Retail delivered a robust performance with another quarter of strong revenue growth and profit performance. The bottom line grew by 12.9 percent YoY to Rs 2,415 crore while revenue from operations stood at Rs 61,559 crore, up 21.1 percent YoY. Store footfalls was at 219 million, the highest ever, up from 201 million in Q3FY23.  RIL said the business continued to invest in strengthening its supply chain capabilities by expanding over 1.7 million sq. ft. of warehouse space. Digital Commerce and New Commerce contributed to 17 percent of revenue.  &amp;quot;In last 10 years, we have allocated capital to consumer-centric businesses which has transformed the earning mix and positioned us as a consumer and tech company,&amp;quot; Srikanth said.  The company said focus will remain on expanding distribution reach across geographies for this segment.  Also Read: Reliance Retail Q4: Net profit up 13% at Rs 2,415 crore on highest ever footfalls  O2C  Revenue for the O2C business fell by 11.8 percent YoY to Rs 1,28,633 crore. Exports dropped 0.4 percent to Rs 78,851 crore. EBITDA, meanwhile, improved 14.4 percent to Rs 16,293 crore.  EBITDA margin was at 12.7 percent, an increase of 290 bps YoY led by strength in transportation fuel cracks, optimized feedstock cost and advantageous ethane cracking economics. This was partially offset by lower polyester chain margins. Special additional excise duty on transportation fuels adversely impacted earnings by Rs 711 crore. The full year impact of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels on earnings was at Rs 6,648 crore.  Commenting on the O2C business' full-year performance, Srikanth said the vertical had benefited strong global oil demand. &ldquo;We had a better margin capture and also superior product placement. Higher fuel cracks offset weak downstream margins,&rdquo; he said.  The O2C business includes refining, petrochemicals, fuel retailing through Reliance BP Mobility Limited, aviation fuel and bulk wholesale marketing.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas revenue more than doubled to Rs 4,556 crore as compared to Q4FY22, mainly on account of higher price realisation and 13 percent increase in KGD6 gas production. The average price realised for KGD6 was at $11.39 /MMBTU in the March quarter, against $6.13 / MMBTU a year ago. MMBTU is Metric Million British Thermal Unit. KGD6 gas production likely to increase to 30 mmscmd in FY24 with commissioning of MJ field, where testing and commissioning is underway.  EBITDA increased sharply to Rs 3,801 crore, which was up almost 2.5x on YoY basis. EBITDA margin was at 83.4 percent for Q4FY23 up by about 60 bps as compared to Q4FY22.  The company expects the gas market environment in India to remain positive in the medium term, while global gas price are likely to remain volatile with demand uncertainties and higher EU storage.  In the current financial quarter, Reliance Industries said it has sold the entire volume of 6 MMSCMD in an e-auction held on April 12 and the Gas sale purchase agreement (GSPA) is under execution with successful bidders.  Media  RIL's media business reported a loss of 35 crore for the quarter. Revenue fell 8.5 percent to Rs 1,484 crore.  TV News segment grew, driven by the growth in advertising revenue. Excluding movie production segment which has project-based volatility, revenue was marginally up with growth across all verticals, RIL said.  TV News reported a sharp QoQ improvement in EBITDA and margins. Consolidated EBITDA was down primarily due to Viacom18&rsquo;s investments in new initiatives (Sports and Digital verticals had an impact of Rs 170 crore on EBITDA) and a lag in recovery of ad revenues.

Over the past year, IEX's stock has been declining steadily, with the shares falling by almost 35 percent. Recent reports indicate that the Dalmia Bharat Group plans to sell off its entire 15 percent stake in India's primary power trading platform.  In its previous report, Bernstein expressed concerns about multiple challenges that IEX may face in the future. First, the entry of a strong competitor, PTC India, and ensuing price wars. Second, the risk of tariff ceiling, and third, the possibility of mandatory coupling if market-based economic despatch (MBED) is implemented.  This would result in the mandatory pooling of power and exchanges. The report also noted that the volumes on the exchange had fallen in the current quarter due to a lower ceiling for transactions. In addition, Bernstein expressed skepticism about the exponential growth potential of IEX and believed that the stock was overpriced.  The brokerage firm has upgraded Biocon to an &lsquo;outperform&rsquo; rating based on positive developments in the US biosimilar market. Reliance Industries was reintroduced, while M&amp;amp;amp;M has corrected due to concerns over the slowdown in rural markets caused by weaker-than-expected monsoon. The brokerage firm retained Infosys, Zomato, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, Cipla, Crompton Consumer, Ultratech and L&amp;amp;amp;T to its portfolio.  It reports that a reduction in commodities is expected to support margins, and early-cycle benefits in financials and real estate are increasing the expectation of low earnings risk. The firm argues for positive returns in the near term, with Nifty heading back to 18,000-18,500.  The brokerage firm reports that while some sectors have seen downward revisions, upgrades in financials have offset these declines. A reduction in commodities is expected to support margins, and early-cycle benefits in financials and real estate are increasing the expectation of low earnings risk.  &amp;quot;Since we see this as more driven by the domestic economy, we highlighted sectors like financials, real estate, and cement to do well. The early cycle nature of recovery is expected to support these sectors, and we still maintain our &lsquo;OW&rsquo; stance. We also remain a marginal OW&rsquo; on IT, healthcare, and durables. We remain &lsquo;UW&rsquo; on staples, utilities, metals and industrials (excluding L&amp;amp;amp;T, cement),&amp;quot; Bernstein said in its report.  The brokerage firm sees the Q3 GDP growth of 4.4 percent as the bottom, with interest rates and inflation nearing their peak and margin risks moderating due to a decline in commodities. Positive support from early cycle sectors like real estate and financials, along with a good winter cropping season, are expected to boost growth. Manufacturing growth is expected to turn positive in Q4FY23 after YoY declines in Q2/Q3FY23. Although the outlook for monsoons is unclear, recent comments from IMD suggest a normal monsoon season."

The company&nbsp;has a 10.34 percent&nbsp;weightage on the Nifty 50 index.  Operating profit is expected to come in at Rs 36,805 crore, up 17 percent from the year-ago period. As per estimates, topline and bottomline will grow in single digits, both sequentially and year-on-year (YoY). Consolidated revenue is seen at Rs 2.26 lakh crore and net profit at Rs 16,573 crore.    The growth in EBITDA will largely be on the back of a strong&nbsp;oil-to- chemicals (O2C) segment. Resilient gross refining margins, improvement in petchem margins on the back of China reopening and higher exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) profitability on slightly higher gas production will drive the operating performance, said analysts.  Net profit growth is expected to rise only 2 percent YoY as the base quarter had no impact on the windfall tax. Foreign broking firm Jefferies estimates 28 percent YoY jump in taxes at Rs 5,625 crore.  That said, windfall taxes have been revised downwards several times since their imposition in July 2022. So, the biggest impact on the bottomline has already played out in the previous quarters.  Also read:&nbsp;Options Trade | An earnings-based non-directional options strategy in Reliance Industries  &ldquo;A cooling crude price, pick-up in gasoline spreads and the near removal of the windfall tax has led to higher refining margins. Coupled with the start of phase-3 gas production from its eastern offshore block, this should drive oil and gas profits higher in the March and June quarters,&rdquo; CLSA&rsquo;s Vikash Kumar Jain wrote in a recent note.  The O2C segment&rsquo;s EBITDA has been pegged at Rs 15,387 crore.  Retail and telecom  These two segments that have been powering growth for the diversified conglomerate are expected to continue their steady run. Reliance Retail's topline is likely to cross the Rs 70,000-crore mark with 35 percent YoY EBITDA growth at Rs 5,003 crore on the back of an increased store footprint and benefits of operating leverage.  In the quarter gone by, the company made rapid strides in the consumer segment. It launched a made-for-India consumer packaged goods brand, Independence, in Gujarat. It also relaunched and rolled out the iconic beverage brand Campa, after acquiring it from its owner Pure Drinks in August 2022.  On the other hand, the telecom segment&rsquo;s EBITDA is expected to rise 14 percent YoY to Rs 12,803 crore for the March quarter. While Kotak Institutional Equities has pegged subscriber addition at 5.7 million, ICICI Securities sees it at 6.5 million. Meanwhile, the average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to remain flat on a sequential basis at Rs 179 amid lower number of days.  &ldquo;Further clarity on the Rs 75,000-crore investment in the new energy business, growth in retail store additions, and any pricing action in telecom are the key monitorables,&rdquo; according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Digital services and retail segments recorded double-digit growth.  &amp;quot;Higher realization in O2C (oil-to-chemical) business with increase in energy prices along with nearly 2x growth in oil &amp;amp;amp; gas business also contributed to growth in revenue,&amp;quot; RIL said in its filing to exchanges.  Click Here To Read All Earnings Related News  3) Operating Performance  The oil-telecom-to-retail conglomerate has recorded a 13.5 percent YoY increase in EBITDA at Rs 38,460 crore for the quarter. EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.  The company said the operating income was backed by strong growth in subscriber base and 17.5 percent increase in ARPU (average revenue per user) in digital services segment.  Growth across consumption baskets, addition of new stores and rising contribution from digital channels in the retail segment also supported EBITDA for the quarter.  Improvement in middle distillate cracks (partially offset by weak downstream chemical margins and SAED (special additional excise duty) related costs in O2C segment), and higher gas price realization with increase in ceiling price, too, aided the growth in operating income.  Depreciation increased by 32.6 percent YoY to Rs 10,187 crore due to expanded asset base across all the businesses and higher network utilization in digital services business.  Finance costs at Rs 5,201 crore for the quarter jumped by 36.4 percent compared to year-ago period due to increase in interest rates and loan balances.  4) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms recorded double-digit growth across earnings parameters with revenue and EBITDA at the highest ever levels on quarterly basis.  Consolidated profit for the quarter grew by 28.6 percent to Rs 4,881 crore compared to corresponding period last fiscal, with nearly 17 percent on-year fall in finance cost at Rs 1,047 crore in Q3FY23.  Consolidated revenue at Rs 24,892 crore surged 20.9 percent compared to year-ago period, driven by steady increase in both subscriber base and ARPU for the connectivity business. In addition, the company said higher realizations from digital services drove JPL's consolidated revenue growth.  Jio reported ARPU at Rs 178.2 per subscriber per month, up from Rs 177.2 in previous quarter and gaining significantly from Rs 151.6 in same quarter of last financial year.  RIL Q3 Earnings Highlights: Revenue up 15% YoY; board approves Rs 20,000 crore fundraising  Its customer base was at 432.9 million as of December FY23, up from 427.6 million at the end of September FY23. It had a customer base of 421 million as of December FY22.  At the operating level, EBITDA increased by 25.1 percent YoY to Rs 12,519 crore led by revenue growth and margin improvement. The margin expanded by 170 bps due to increased ARPU and benefit from lower spectrum usage charges.

It remains on track to complete its pan India 5G rollout by December 2023.  &amp;quot;Within three months of launch, Jio True5G is now available across 134 cities and would be available across India by December 2023,&amp;quot; Akash M Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm said.  In addition, he said Jio would connect over 100 million premises with JioFiber and JioAirFiber, &amp;quot;offering unparalleled digital experiences&amp;quot;.  6) Reliance Retail  Also, Reliance Retail business recorded highest ever quarterly revenue and EBITDA for the quarter with highest ever footfall at 201 million across formats and geographies for Q3FY23, against 160 million footfall in Q3FY22 and 180 million in Q2FY23.  The retail business registered a 6.2 percent on-year growth in profit at Rs 2,400 crore with double-digit growth in topline and operating income.  Revenue increased by 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 60,096 crore for the quarter led by well-rounded growth across all baskets and channels.  EBITDA from operations at Rs 4,657 crore jumped by 32.2 percent YoY with a +70-basis point margin improvement driven by favourable mix, operating leverage and efficiencies, Reliance said.  Read: Reliance Retail's Q3 revenue jumps 17%, net profit up 6.2% on highest ever footfalls  7) O2C Business  In O2C business, &amp;quot;middle distillate product fundamentals remain strong with firm demand, constrained supply, and high natural gas prices in Europe. Downstream chemical products witnessed margin pressure with excess supply and relatively weak regional demand,&amp;quot; said Mukesh Ambani.  The business recorded revenue at Rs 1.44 lakh crore for the quarter ended December FY23, growing 10 percent over the corresponding period last fiscal led by higher price realisation as crude oil prices went up by 11 percent.  The topline growth was constrained by lower throughput with planned maintenance&nbsp;and inspection activity turnaround during the quarter, the company said.  EBITDA for the O2C segment at Rs 13,926 crore grew by 2.9 percent on-year supported by strength in middle distillate cracks.  &amp;quot;EBITDA was, however, partially offset by weak margins across polymer, polyester chain and light distillates products. Continued SAED on transportation fuels also impacted earnings by Rs 1,898 crore,&amp;quot; the company said.  The higher price realisations despite lower downstream product volumes boosted exports for the quarter by 21 percent YoY to Rs 78,331 crore.  Also Read: RIL Q3: Net profit comes in at Rs 17,806 crore, revenue rises 15% YoY  8) Upstream Business  The upstream business delivered robust growth with sustained production from KG D6 block along with higher realization, said Mukesh Ambani.  Reliance is on track to reach 30 MMSCMD of gas production in FY24 after the commissioning of MJ field. This will significantly enhance India&rsquo;s energy security in a volatile energy market environment, he said.  The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas exploration &amp;amp;amp; production business registered a 74.8 percent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 4,474 crore for December FY23 quarter, led by improved gas price realization and higher production.  Average gas price realized for KGD6 was at $11.3 per MMBTU (million British thermal units) in Q3FY23 against $6.1 per MMBTU in Q3FY22, with raising of gas price ceiling to ~ $12.46 per MMBtu by the Government of India, Reliance said.  EBITDA for the quarter at Rs 3,880 crore increased sharply by 90.9 percent over corresponding period last fiscal.  KGD6 production during the quarter at 41.9 Bcfe (billions of cubic feet equivalent) was up by 6.1 percent YoY, the company said.  9) Media Business  The media business has recorded consolidated gross revenue of Rs 2,166 crore for the quarter, growing 12.5 percent YoY, primarily driven by movies and sports business amidst a challenging advertising environment.  The company said the continued softness in the macro-economic environment dampened the advertising demand and advertising revenue of all segments was down on a YoY basis.  Core categories continued to spend on advertising, but driving growth was challenging due to restrained spends by brands across categories and a sharp pull-back by start-ups and e-com players, it added.  On the operating front, EBITDA at Rs 52 crore declined sharply by 86.7 percent on YoY basis with the drop-in advertising revenue directly impacting margins as investments in content continued with a view to consolidate operating metrics.  The profitability of the business also suffered due to investments in new initiatives, digital entertainment and sports, which had a negative contribution of around Rs 140 crore to EBITDA, Reliance said.  10) Debt and Capex  Reliance's capital expenditure for the quarter ended December 2022 was Rs 37,599 crore, increasing significantly from Rs 27,582 crore in the corresponding period of last fiscal.  Outstanding debt was Rs 3.03 lakh crore and cash and cash equivalents were Rs 1.93 lakh crore as of December FY23.  &amp;quot;Strong balance sheet and robust cash flows remains the cornerstone of our commitment in growing existing businesses as well as investing in new opportunities,&amp;quot; Ambani said.

RIL had booked sale from its divestment of shale gas assets that resulted in an exceptional item of Rs 2,836 crore in the third quarter a year ago.  Net profit attributable to owners of the company, excluding non-controlling interest was Rs 15,792 crore, which was 15 percent lower than a year ago.  Company officials said higher finance costs were due to interest rate hikes by central banks and higher loan balances.  According to an analyst poll conducted by Moneycontrol, its net profit was expected to grow 4.4 percent to Rs 16,366 crore from a year earlier. Revenue was expected to rise 21 percent YoY to Rs 2.23 lakh crore.  The company said its EBITDA increased by 13.5 percent YoY to Rs 38,460 crore ($4.6 billion), on account of strong growth in the subscriber base for its digital business, growth across consumption baskets, improvement in middle distillate cracks and higher gas price realisation with an increase in ceiling price, and marginally higher volumes in the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment.

Its revenue from operations was at 24,892 crore, up 20.9 percent YoY. EBITDA increased 25.1 percent YoY to 12,519 crore.  Revenue growth was driven by a steady increase in both the subscriber base and average revenue per user (ARPU) for the connectivity business. EBITDA increase led by revenue growth and margin improvement, the company said, adding that EBITDA margin increased by 170 basis points due to increased ARPU and benefit from lower spectrum usage charges.  Net subscriber addition was 5.3 million as gross adds remained strong at 34.2 million in 3Q FY23, RIL said. ARPU increased 17.5 percent YoY to Rs 178.20 per subscriber per month due to a better subscriber mix. Sequentially, it rose 0.56 percent.

It is now available in 134 cities and towns in India, enhancing the customer experience while enabling next-generation services.&amp;quot;  Reliance Retail  RIL's retail business reported net profit growth of 6.2 percent YoY to Rs 2,400 crore. Revenue from operations rose 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 60,096 crore. EBITDA increased 24.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,773 crore.  The company said the revenue increase was led by well-rounded growth across all baskets and channels. EBITDA from operations increased with a 70 basis point margin improvement driven by a favourable mix, operating leverage and efficiencies.  During the quarter, Reliance Retail increased its store count to 17,225. The quarter also recorded the highest-ever footfalls at 201 million across formats and geographies.  The company said Digital Commerce and New Commerce businesses continue to demonstrate the strength of their business model and grew 38 percent YoY and contributed to 18 percent of the revenue.  &ldquo;Our performance during the quarter demonstrates the underlying strengths and efficiencies of our business model that enable us to serve our customers with excellence at all times,&amp;quot; said Isha M Ambani, Executive Director, Reliance Retail Ventures. &amp;quot;We remain steadfast in offering the best shopping experience across all our stores and digital platforms to deepen our bond with our customers and vendor partners.&rdquo;  O2C  Segmental revenue for the oil to chemicals (O2C) business rose 10 percent YoY to Rs 1,44,630 crore. EBITDA increased 2.9 percent to Rs 13,926 crore.  Commenting on the energy vertical, group Joint CFO V Srikanth said, &ldquo;Energy businesses accounted for 70% of incremental growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis.&rdquo; He said that the oil and gas segment maintained stable production and higher realisation led to higher contribution.&rdquo;  Revenues increased on account of higher price realisation as crude oil prices went up by 11 percent year-on-year, said the company in a press release. Revenue growth was constrained by lower throughput with planned Maintenance &amp;amp;amp; Inspection activity turnaround during the quarter. Srikanth added, &ldquo;Volatile price environment and weak demand from China impacted downstream margin.&rdquo;  Growth in EBITDA was supported by strength in middle distillate cracks. This was, however, partially offset by weak margins across polymer, polyester chain and light distillates products. Continued SAED (special additional excise duty) on transportation fuels also impacted earnings by Rs 1,898 crore, RIL added.  The company sees Middle Distillate cracks to remain firm on lower inventories, seasonal demand, and the impending loss of Russian oil products. Meanwhile, petrochemical feedstock price volatility will likely continue amidst uncertain geopolitical situations and recessionary trends in developed economies, it said.  Srikanth attributed the quarter-on-quarter 12% decline in crude oil prices to demand and recession fears in Europe, the USA. However, the official added, India&rsquo;s demand for fuels and downstream products remained strong even as global demand declined.  RIL management said that the global oil demand is estimated to grow by 1.9 million barrels per day in 2023, led by the US, China and India. Srikanth said that some of the new capacity that will be commissioned in the second half of 2023r would result in an effective net global refining capacity addition of around 1 million barrels per day, so while their margin will get some support, the upside would be limited.  Also Read: RIL Q3 Results | 10 key highlights  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  Revenue for the oil and gas segment, which refers to RIL's exploration and production business, increased 74.8 percent YoY to Rs 4,474 crore led by improved gas price realisation and higher production. The company&rsquo;s outlook for the gas market remains positive. &ldquo;Gas price realization is expected to remain high in near-time even though some cool-off has happened,&rdquo; said Sanjay Roy, Senior Vice President &ndash;exploration and production at RIL.  The average gas price realised for KGD6 was at $11.3/MMBTU in 3QFY23 vs $6.1/MMBTU in 3Q FY22, with the raising of gas price ceiling to $12.46/MMBtu by the Government of India.  EBITDA increased 90.9 percent YoY to Rs 3,880 crore. EBITDA margin was at 86.7 percent. RIL said geopolitical uncertainty and constrained supply are likely to keep gas prices firm in the near term while incremental production and higher prices will support EBITDA growth in the near term.  Media  Net profit for its media business was at Rs 9 crore, down 97.1 percent YoY. Revenue from operations, meanwhile, increased 11.6 percent to Rs 1,850 crore primarily driven by the movies and sports business amidst a challenging advertising environment.  RIL Q3 Earnings Highlights: Revenue up 15% YoY; board approves Rs 20,000 crore fundraising  The continued softness in the macroeconomic environment dampened the advertising demand and ad revenue of all our segments was down on a YoY basis, RIL said.

The company said inflation has been showing signs of cooling off, but the revival of consumer demand remains crucial for growth in the media business. Our strong positions across verticals put us in a pole position to grow once the macroeconomic environment normalises, it added.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

As per a Moneycontrol survey, 20 out of 36 respondents anticipate that the central bank will continue with its withdrawal of an accommodative stance, while the remaining 16 predict a shift to a neutral stance.  Improvement in current account deficit:&nbsp;Going by the latest reports, many economists expect India's current account to improve in fiscal year 2024 led by an incrementally&nbsp;narrowing&nbsp;trade deficit amid receding commodity prices, especially that of oil. &nbsp;&amp;quot;Also, solid services trade surplus will strongly offset CAD (current account deficit), which will now likely print sub $100 billion in FY23E ($90 billion vs our earlier forecast of $107 billion)... For FY24E, lower prices of oil (avg. estimate: $90/bbl) and commodities, along with easing domestic/global demand, may lead to CAD/GDP lowering to ~2.2% vs our earlier est. of 2.6% (USD82bn vs USD97bn earlier)&amp;quot;, Emkay Research said in its latest report.  RBI Bulletin: The March edition of the RBI Bulletin gave an optimistic outlook on growth, suggesting that the current estimates for India's GDP growth in FY24 of between 6 and 6.5 percent may be exceeded. According to the report, India is expected to maintain the pace of expansion achieved in 2022-23, indicating that the country's growth trajectory is unlikely to slow down.  US Fed:&nbsp;The US economy seems to be worsening, as suggested by the latest GDP figures with the print coming in at 2.6 percent for the final quarter of last year, slightly below the 2.7 percent predicted by analysts. Due to the overhang of the banking crisis, financial specialists predict that the credit markets in the US will remain under pressure, and there is a risk of the economy slipping into a recession. In light of this, the US Federal Reserve may decide against raising interest rates further and may even introduce multiple rate cuts later in 2023. Investors are now closely monitoring the release of core personal consumption expenditure data, set to be released later on Friday. These data releases are crucial in providing investors with insight into the Federal Reserve's probable future actions."

The global research and broking firm maintained its overweight call on the stock price of RIL with a target price of Rs 2,960, an upside of 32 percent from the current market price.  At 11:40 hours, Reliance Industries was quoting at Rs 2,240.20, up Rs 3.35, or 0.15 percent on BSE. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 2,254.95 and an intraday low of Rs 2,202.30.  According to JP Morgan, RIL&rsquo;s ongoing capex and investments should allow it to scale up its already industry-leading petrochem, telecom and retail segments over the next two years. It is of the view that the stock offers long-term investors an attractive entry opportunity given the multiple catalysts over CY24-25, although admittedly more immediate catalysts appear limited.  &ldquo;In an increasingly capital-scarce environment, RIL&rsquo;s core strength of investing large amounts of capital in growth projects is a key positive. New energy is likely a multi-year opportunity but may take over 12-18 months to emerge as a material part of the investment case,&rdquo; it said.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Ongoing investments position RIL for growth from FY25:  JP Morgan is of the view that RIL stock is trading 2 percent above its bear case. The stock&rsquo;s multiple compression in the last year appears to mirror the index derating rather than reflect new stock-specific risks. The FII sell-down means FII holdings stand at six-year lows. Strong order-to-cash (O2C), and exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) cash flows allow RIL to continue to invest across businesses.  On balance, the brokerage firm believes that earnings assumptions have upside risks. Every $1 difference between crude oil price and the total value of petroleum products (GRM)/$50 per tonne petchem spreads / 10 percent ARPU increase impacts EPS by 5 percent/6 percent/5 percent, respectively.  Retail growth has been strong, on track for $2 billion PAT by FY25:  &ldquo;Jio&rsquo;s wireless market leadership continues to expand, but the non-telecom business has been slow to pick up (enterprises, advertising). While near-term retail growth should slow down in line with softer consumer demand, Reliance Retail&rsquo;s focus and investments on square feet additions, omni-channel distribution, multiple brands/acquisition, own brands focus, large warehousing space additions and scaling up new commerce/Jio Mart/FMCG is positive,&rdquo; JP Morgan added.  Investment Thesis:  In CY23 JP Morgan continues to see RIL as a relative outperformer in what could be a sluggish earnings environment overall, but see multiple potential catalysts over CY24-25 to help drive absolute outperformance. It sees continued strength in the refining business, a likely rebound in Petrochem spreads from decadal low levels from China re-opening, and volume growth in E&amp;amp;amp;P &ndash; driving earnings growth.  &ldquo;RIL continues to offer multiple growth optionality across businesses (petrochem, E&amp;amp;amp;P, telecom, retail, financial services, new energy) and ongoing investments should drive the next leg of growth. The company&rsquo;s ongoing capex/investments should allow it to scale up its (already Industry-leading) petrochem, telecom and retail segments. New energy is likely a multi-year opportunity, but we do not see it as material to the investment case for the next 12-18 mths. We expect this year&rsquo;s AGM to focus on Jio Financial Services,&rdquo; JP Morgan added.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Antique Stock Broking has initiated coverage with a buy rating and a target share price of Rs 2,900 on the RIL. Systematic Institutional Equities too, has rated the stock as a buy, but with a slightly lower target share price of Rs 2,825.  Antique says RIL is poised for strong earnings growth in multiple sectors over the next two years, and is well-positioned to capitalise on a major value-creating opportunity in the new energy business. The company's oil-to-chemicals or O2C sector is expected to benefit from a &amp;quot;platinum age of refining,&amp;quot; while its telecom business is positioned to capitalise on the transition to 5G with a significant tailwind from tariff increases.  Additionally, RIL's retail segment is expected to see robust growth because of aggressive investments made thus far, while the company's oil and gas segment is expected to benefit from increased gas production, driving earnings growth.  &ldquo;We expect Reliance Retail Ventures' (RRVL) revenue/ EBITDA to grow at 26 percent CAGR over FY23-25E, with core retail revenue/ EBITDA growing at 31 percent / 32 percent over the same period. For the O2C business, we expect a sharp EBITDA growth of 30 percent in FY24, likely to decline by 6 percent in FY25, given that Russian crude discount could fall sharply in FY25,&rdquo; Antique said in its note to investors.  &ldquo;For telecom, we expect pending tariff revision to be taken up soon, which, along with higher 5G data consumption, is set to drive ARPU, while rollout of high ARPU fibre to the home (FTTH)/ Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) adds a large revenue stream. These collectively will drive EBITDA growth of 24 percent and 20 percent over FY24 and FY25, respectively. We expect 20 percent tariff revision, resulting in a small 3 percent SIM consolidation,&rdquo; the Antique report added.  Systematic Institutional Equities says its forecast for FY23E-FY25E shows a modest compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13 percent in EBITDA, largely driven by retail and Jio. The consumer business will continue to experience robust EBITDA growth of 22 percent, primarily due to a 23 percent growth in telecom and 19 percent in retail during this period.  The brokerage firm anticipates that strong petrochemical margins will more than offset lower gross refining margins (GRM), resulting in a projected 3 percent CAGR in the O2C EBITDA. While the upstream business may benefit from a 58 percent increase in volumes from FY24E onwards, lower realisations could limit EBITDA growth in this business to 7 percent, the Systematic Institutional Equities report said.  Meanwhile, the brokerage firm sees a possibility of a significant surge in net debt, rising to Rs 1.8 trillion in FY25E from Rs 1.2 trillion in FY22, due to increased capital expenditure in various sectors such as petrochemicals, 5G, organised retail, energy transition, and new energy businesses.  Over the past year, RIL's stock price has hovered in the range of Rs 2,300 to Rs 2,800, underperforming the Nifty by 3.8 percent. However, RIL's option value could potentially increase as the company's new energy business nears commencement. Some of the key upside triggers that could positively impact the stock price include a hike in mobile tariffs, the listing of retail and Jio, and the monetisation of O2C and RIL Syngas, Systematic Institutional Equities added.  RIL has revealed an ambitious plan to invest heavily in the development of solar energy and giga factories for energy storage, fuel cell systems, green hydrogen, and power electronics, with the aim of achieving 100 GW of vertically integrated solar energy. The company plans to invest Rs 750 billion in this initiative, which will cover approximately 30 GW of integrated solar plants.  &amp;quot;We anticipate that RIL will make additional investment announcements in the future. With the benefit of an attractive 20 percent PLI and tariff protection of 40 percent, combined with RIL's critical technology acquisitions and cost competitiveness, the solar energy sector is poised to deliver a minimum of 20 percent EBITDA margin and 20 percent IRR,&rdquo; the Antique report said."

Buyers have shifted some transactions to the currency, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Payments vary from cargo to cargo, depending in part on the demands of specific traders, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details are private.  Reliance, BPCL and Nayara didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to requests for comment.  The European Union&rsquo;s recent ban on imports of refined oil products from Russia has positioned India as an increasingly important customer for the shipments. Russia has been India&rsquo;s top crude supplier since June as cargoes previously bound for Europe have been diverted to Asia &mdash; often sold at well below the $60-a-barrel cap.  The UAE dirham provides both Indian buyers and Russian sellers with a relatively predictable currency &mdash; pegged to the dollar &mdash; without the greenback&rsquo;s potential sanctions complications. Even on deals that don&rsquo;t directly violate US and EU restrictions, some intermediary banks often take additional steps to avoid any risks to other banking relationships abroad.  India is the UAE&rsquo;s&nbsp;second-largest trade partner&nbsp;and officials are working on a mechanism to boost trade in dirhams and rupees.  Most oil deals are still being transacted in dollars. India&rsquo;s oil minister said he was unaware of the use of dirham in oil purchases.  &ldquo;If you are asking me officially am I in the know of these payment channels, no, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Hardeep Singh Puri said in a Monday interview in Bengaluru. Officials are open to holding discussion with other countries on the issue, he said. &ldquo;If the need arises, we will need to talk.&rdquo;    India is probably willing to accommodate requests from Russia to offer payment in dirham, considering the bargain prices offered on crude, according to Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights.  Still, a move away from the US dollar could risk drawing the ire of some officials in Washington.

In fact, it was a disheartening start to the February series on January 27 and, as a result, the market shed more than 2 percent in the passing week.  The Nifty50 closed at more than four-month low of 17,604, breaking out of the strong support at 17,800 held for a month amid consolidation and posting the biggest weekly loss since the week ended December 23.  The next support lies at 50 WEMA (weekly exponential moving average) of 17,400 after breaking the short-term moving averages of 9, 20 and 21 weeks. Experts hope to see a lot of volatility given the Union Budget week, but if the Nifty manages to hold the 50 WEMA, then there are fair chances that the index can easily surpass the 17,800-18,200 zone in the coming days, followed by 18,500.  &amp;quot;From an optimist point of view, it&rsquo;s good that the market is approaching this event (Budget 2023) on a lighter note and any favourable outcome would lift the markets higher. On the other hand, a slight disappointment would lead to further aberration in the market,&amp;quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  &amp;quot;Considering the &lsquo;positive divergence&rsquo; in the &lsquo;RSI-smoothened&rsquo; oscillator, we may expect some recovery from lower levels,&amp;quot; he said.  He feels 17,700 &ndash; 17,800 are to be seen as strong hurdles. If the market has to regain strength as well as confidence, Nifty needs to surpass 18,000 on a closing basis.  The market expert advised traders to keep a note of all these scenarios and should ideally remain light ahead of the event.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 27 closing prices:  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Reliance Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,337 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,700 | Return: 15 percent  For the past 8 months, the stock has been in a wide trading range of Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,700. Whenever the market falls to extreme levels, Reliance falls on the lower boundary of the bearish parallel. On the other hand, Reliance was at Rs 2,700 whenever the market touched 18,500 level.  After a period of 4 months, the stock has again fallen to the level of Rs 2,300. Based on the logic of the bullish parallel channel, contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on the downside around Rs 2,250. However, it requires a final stop-loss at Rs 2,150. On the upside, Rs 2,440, Rs 2,550 and Rs 2,700 would be major barriers.    Titan Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,331 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,600 | Return: 11 percent  From the lows of July 2022, the stock displayed a spectacular rally. It was at Rs 1,800 level and moved to Rs 2,790 in a period of 4 months, which is significant.  In the last 3 months, the stock is displaying a corrective move and has hit the support of 50 percent retracement ratio of the entire rally of Rs 1,000 points.  The positional/Contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on dips at Rs 2,230. Place a stop-loss at Rs 2,150, which is slightly below the retracement level of 61.80 percent. Hurdles would be Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,600.    HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,616 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,500 | Target: Rs 1,750 | Return: 8 percent  The stock remained well above Rs 1,600-1,550 levels in last 3 months. In fact, whenever the stock dropped to Rs 1,600 or Rs 1,550 levels, it was quickly bought up.  In the last three days, Bank Nifty and bank stocks declined vertically, however, HDFC Bank remained the least loser.  Technically, we should be positional buyers between Rs 1,600 and Rs 1,550. Keep stop-loss at Rs 1,500. On the upside, the stock may decline towards Rs 1,680 or Rs 1,750 levels.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 346 | Stop-Loss: Rs 334 | Target: Rs 367 | Return: 6 percent  The stock has recently seen a corrective phase where prices have corrected from the high of Rs 361 to Rs 325. The stock has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance and has seen a gradual increase in volumes along with the price upmove.  The prices have also managed to show relative strength in the volatile markets during last week. The RSI (relative strength index) oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum and hence, we expect an upmove in the stock in the short term.  Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities in the range of Rs 346-342. The possible near term targets for the stock are expected around Rs 358 and Rs 367. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 334.    Maruti Suzuki: Buy | LTP: Rs 8,737 | Stop-Loss: Rs 8,420 | Target: Rs 8,970 | Return: 3 percent  Post a corrective phase, the auto stocks have seen a positive momentum during last week and within this sector, Maruti has witnessed a pullback move along with rise in volumes. After the recent price-wise correction, the stock witnessed some consolidation and price volumes action indicates that the stock would resume its higher degree uptrend.  The RSI oscillator is in buy mode on the daily chart and is turning positive on the weekly charts as well.  Hence, traders can look to buy the stock on dips in the range of Rs 8,620-8,600 for potential targets around Rs 8,820 and Rs 8,970. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 8,420.    Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital  KEI Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,573 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Target: Rs 1,780 | Return: 13 percent  The KEI has recently shown a bounce to the upside while taking support from the Bullish trend line which the prices have respected since May 2021.  Around the level of Rs 1,385 the stock has witnessed change in its polarity by the prices which points towards the rising bullish sentiment behind the intact trend.  The stock's price has surpassed the 20-week EMA which acted as a variable support for the prices.  While the momentum indicator RSI on the Daily timeframe has shown a Range shift which reflects the rising momentum for the prices.

Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL) on January 20 said its revenue from operations for the quarter ended December 2022 (Q3FY23) came in at Rs 220,592 crore, up 15.32 percent against Rs 191,271 crore a year ago.  Its consolidated net profit for the quarter stood at Rs 17,806 crore, down 13.30 percent year-on-year (YoY).  The company had reported a net profit of Rs 20,539 crore in the same quarter last year.  Company officials said higher finance costs were due to interest rate hikes by central banks and higher loan balances.

The Q3 benefitted from strong refining performance offset from lower throughput due to planned maintenance along with weak polymer and polyester margins.  Retail segment saw healthy growth as outlets operated normally, while Jio reported steady performance given no tariff hikes and customer additions (+1.2 percent QoQ).  Motilal Oswal  Reiterated 'buy' rating on the stock with an SoTP-based target price of Rs 2,800.  Brokerage house revise its capex estimates for FY23/FY24 to Rs 1,700&nbsp;billion /Rs 1,000&nbsp;billion from Rs 1,650&nbsp;billion/Rs 750&nbsp;billion, respectively, building in Rs 1,262&nbsp;billion/Rs 280 billion in telecom, Rs 350&nbsp;billion/Rs 350&nbsp;billion in the standalone business and the rest in others.  Using SOTP, broking firm value the refining and petrochemical segment at 7.5x on December 24 EV/EBITDA to arrive at our valuation of Rs 879/share for the standalone business.  It ascribe an equity valuation of Rs 809/share to RJio and Rs 1,270/share to Reliance Retail, factoring in the recent stake sale.  Nomura  The research firm has maintained &lsquo;buy&rsquo; rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,850 per share amid robust O2C performance and healthy consumer business.

Jefferies  Brokerage house has kept &lsquo;buy&rsquo; rating on the stock with a target at Rs 3,110 per share with EBITDA beat in O2C and Jio, while retail was in-line.

Net profit is expected to grow 4.4 percent to Rs 16,366 crore from a year earlier and sequentially by 19.7 percent, according to the average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. Revenue is expected to rise 21 percent YoY to Rs 2.23 lakh crore.  The company will report its December quarter earnings on January 20, after market hours.    While most brokerages expect RIL to report broad-based growth across segments, the retail and Jio verticals&rsquo; performances will be watched with particular interest.  &ldquo;We estimate RIL&rsquo;s Q3 FY23 consolidated EBITDA to grow 10 percent sequentially, driven by a recovery for the O2C (oil-to-chemical) segment on a low base, strong uptick for upstream and sustained growth across consumer-facing businesses,&rdquo; analysts at Nomura noted.  Energy business In the last quarter, the central government's special additional excise duty on export of refined products had cost the company Rs 4,039 crore. This had resulted in flat profit growth year on year. However, the windfall tax has been revised lower several times till then, and thus, O2C earnings will recover sequentially.  Tax on export of diesel now stands at Rs 5 per litre and the same on overseas shipments of ATF (aviation turbine fuel) now stands at Rs 3.5 a litre.  &ldquo;This segment&rsquo;s earnings would recover QoQ led by lower taxes aiding higher refining margins, though partly offset by lower petchem spreads,&rdquo; added UBS. Jefferies has pegged this segment's EBITDA at Rs 12,893 crore.  Elevated middle distillate cracks, higher E&amp;amp;amp;P (exploration &amp;amp;amp; production) profitability on gas price hikes and currency depreciation will also aid earnings recovery, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE) noted.  Telecom and retail Analysts expect telecom arm Jio&rsquo;s ARPU (average revenue per user) to improve to Rs 179 from Rs 177 last quarter. A strong net subscriber addition of 7 million is expected to boost Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA by 3-4 percent sequentially. Brokerages have forecast an EBITDA of Rs 12,635 crore in this segment.  Residual benefits of the operator&rsquo;s lower Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) will also boost its earnings, added KIE.  Reliance Retail is also expected to continue its strong growth show with an improvement in footfalls during the festive season and the benefits of operating leverage. The launch of its FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) brand Independence and the acquisition of Metro Cash and Carry were the two major announcements on the retail front last quarter.  Investors are keenly awaiting clarity on how the retail business is poised for future growth, with analysts expecting 25-30 percent year-on-year growth in the segment&rsquo;s EBITDA.  The Street will also be watching for announcements on the new energy business and the progress of Jio&rsquo;s 5G rollout.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Here are 10 key highlights from the quarterly earnings scorecard:  1) Profit  Reliance registered a 0.2 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 15,512 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, with cash profit growing 15.4 percent to Rs 27,614 crore for the same period.  Its other income during the quarter fell by 16.8 percent to Rs 3,514 crore YoY.  2) Topline  The gross revenue for the quarter at Rs 2.53 lakh crore was higher by 32.4 percent compared to year-ago period, while revenue from operations increased by 33.7 percent to Rs 2.32 lakh crore.  The increase of 32.4 percent in gross revenue was driven by higher realization in O2C business with sharp increase in energy prices. Revenue growth also reflects continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said.  Also read -&nbsp;RIL to demerge financial services undertaking and list Jio Financial Services  3) Operating Performance  At the operating level, Reliance said EBITDA (excluding the impact of special additional excise duty related costs of Rs 4,039 crore) for the quarter was Rs 38,702 crore, a 27.8 percent growth over a year-ago period. EBITDA including the impact of special additional excise duty stood at Rs 34,663 crore, up 14.5 percent YoY.  The growth in EBITDA was driven by positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies in retail segment, higher gas price realization with increase in ceiling price, increase in ARPU and customer engagement in digital services segment.  4) Finance Cost  Reliance said its finance cost increased by 19.2 percent to Rs 4,554 crore during the quarter YoY, due to higher loan balances and tightening of monetary policy by central banks.  5) Debts and Cash  It has an outstanding debt as of September 2022 of Rs 2.94 lakh crore or $36.2 billion, while the cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 2.01 lakh crore ($24.8 billion).  The capital expenditure for the quarter was Rs 32,534 crore and additionally, it incurred expenses of Rs 88,078 crore for acquisition of spectrum by RJIL.  Also read -&nbsp;Reliance Retail reports 36% YoY jump in Q2 net profit to Rs 2,305 crore  6) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms, which owns Jio, recorded a 26.9 percent year-on-year growth in profit at Rs 4,729 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, backed by strong topline and operating performance.  Revenue from operations for the quarter at Rs 24,275 crore for the quarter increased by 22.7 percent year-on-year aided by increase in average revenue per user (ARPU).  ARPU during the quarter at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month grew at a healthy pace of 23.5 percent growth on YoY basis, while the data traffic increased by 22.7 percent YoY to 28.2 billion GB during the quarter.  Total customer base of Jio as of September FY23 stood at 427.6 million.  &amp;quot;We saw consistent net subscriber additions and higher engagement in digital services segment,&amp;quot; said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director.  Jio Platforms registered a massive 29.2 percent year-on-year growth in EBITDA at Rs 12,011 crore driven by strong revenue growth and margin improvement. The margin at 49.5 percent expanded by 250 bps YoY due to increase in ARPU, which partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs.  7) Reliance Retail  Reliance Retail delivered record revenue and profits during the quarter led by broad-based growth across all consumer baskets, with revenue growing a massive 44.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 57,694 crore and profit increasing 36 percent YoY to Rs 2,305 crore.  The business expanded its physical store network with 795 new store openings, taking the total store count at the end of the quarter to 16,617 stores with an area of 54.5 million square feet, Reliance said.  Retail EBITDA from operations increased 75.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,286 crore in Q2FY23, with a 130 basis point margin improvement over the same time last year resulting from favourable mix, positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies.  As consumers returned to stores, Reliance Retail received over 180 million footfalls across formats and geographies in the quarter, a growth of 23 percent over pre-COVID period, the company said.  8) Oil To Chemicals  The oil to chemicals (O2C) business reported a 32.5 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.59 lakh crore, primarily on account of higher crude oil prices.  Crude oil benchmarks rose YoY due to recovering oil demand, aggressive production cuts announced by OPEC+, limited spare capacity and imminent European Union sanctions on Russian oil exports. Dated Brent crude averaged $100.9 a barrel in Q2FY23, rising by $27.4 a barrel YoY, but declined by $13 per barrel QoQ.  RIL's production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent YoY to 16.2 MMT with planned turnaround of primary and secondary units of SEZ refinery for maintenance &amp;amp;amp; inspection.  &amp;quot;Performance of O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products. Transportation fuel margins were better than last year but significantly lower sequentially,&amp;quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  He further said the segment performance was also impacted by the introduction of special additional excise duties during the quarter to ensure stable supply and lower volatility in the domestic market.  At the operating level, its EBITDA declined by 5.9 percent YoY to Rs 11,968 crore primarily on account of introduction of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels and lower polymer deltas, with margin falling by 310 bps YoY to 7.5 percent.  9) Exports  Exports (including deemed exports) from RIL's India operations increased by 57.5 percent to Rs 86,382 crore compared to year-ago period, mainly due to higher price realizations despite lower downstream product volumes.  10) Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  &amp;quot;Domestic oil &amp;amp;amp; gas business continued to deliver robust performance maintaining production at 19 MMSCMD levels in the KG D6 block, significantly enhancing energy security for the country. We are confident of commissioning MJ Fields by year-end,&amp;quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment clocked a 134.4 percent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 3,853 crore led by higher production and improved gas price realization.  KG-D6 gas production during the quarter was at 41 BCF (RIL's share) against 39.2 BCF (billions of cubic feet) production in Q2FY22.  Average gas price realisation for KG-D6 increased sharply to $9.86 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBTU) during the quarter compared to $3.62 per MMBTU in Q2FY22, with raising of gas price ceiling by the Government of India for first half of FY23, Reliance said.

Revenues at the petrochemical major surged 33.7 percent to Rs 2.32 lakh crore, led by strong performance of the oil-to-chemical, telecom and retail operations in the quarter.  ALSO READ: RIL to demerge financial services undertaking and list Jio Financial Services  Analysts had expected a 12 percent growth in profit to Rs 15,263 crore and a 34 percent rise in sales to Rs 2.25 lakh crore.  The company's consolidated operating profit in the quarter, including&nbsp;the impact of special additional excise duty imposed by the government in July, surged 14.5 percent on-year to Rs 34,663 crore, RIL said.  ALSO READ:&nbsp;Reliance Jio Q2 Result | Net profit rises 28% YoY, ARPU grows 23.5% to Rs 177.2  The government's special additional excise duty on export of refined products cost the company Rs 4,039 crore in the September quarter, RIL said. Excluding for the impact of the special excise duty, consolidated operating profit in the reported quarter rose 27.8 percent on-year to Rs 38,702 crore.  Overall,&nbsp;RIL's operating profit at the consolidated level was aided by&nbsp;the record quarterly operating profit reported by its arms Reliance Retail and Jio&nbsp;Platforms.  &amp;quot;I am pleased with the record performance of our consumer businesses which&nbsp;continue to scale new milestones every quarter,&amp;quot; Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said in a press statement.  RIL said that its overall outstanding debt as on September 30, 2022 was at Rs 2.94&nbsp;lakh crore while cash and cash&nbsp;equivalents stood at Rs&nbsp;2.01&nbsp;lakh crore. Net debt, therefore, rose to Rs 93,253 crore.  RIL&rsquo;s debt increased in the quarter due to higher working capital given the significant dislocation in energy markets, impact of foreign currency liabilities as rupee depreciated against the US dollar and payment of&nbsp;first&nbsp;installment for spectrum, said&nbsp;Srikanth Venkatachari, joint chief financial officer at the conglomerate.  Oil-to-chemical  The oil-to-chemical business of RIL saw strong growth in topline with sales jumping 32.5 percent on-year to Rs 1.6 lakh crore. However, the segment's operating profit fell 5.9 percent on-year to Rs 11,968 crore owing to decline in global refining margins and government's special excise duty.  &amp;quot;Performance of our O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  RIL&rsquo;s production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent year-on-year with planned turnaround of primary and&nbsp;secondary units of special economic zone (SEZ) refinery for M&amp;amp;amp;A.  RIL said its joint venture with Bp continued to face adverse market conditions due to retail fuel prices remaining capped despite higher global crude oil prices.  &amp;quot;Jio-bp is committed to safeguarding interest of channel&nbsp;partners while meeting universal service obligations,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Jio Platforms  The&nbsp;digital services business of RIL, which included Reliance Jio, had a strong quarter on a sequential basis.  The segment's operating profit jumped 5.1 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis to Rs 12,011 crore, aided by strong addition of new customers and benefit of recent tariff hikes at the telecom subsidiary.  Reliance Jio added net new subscribers to the tune of 7.7 million in the September quarter, taking the total user base to 427.6 million as of September 30.  The operating margin of the digital services business also saw a marked improvement to 49.5 percent in the reported quarter from 48.7 percent in the previous&nbsp;quarter.  Organised Retail  The organised retail segment had a record quarter, aided by the full re-opening of the domestic economy post the COVID-19 related restrictions seen through large parts of 2021-22.  The segment's revenues jumped 44.5 percent on-year to Rs 57,694 crore in the reported quarter, which was aided by strong new store additions and footfalls. RIL said it received over 180 million footfalls in the September quarter, which was a 23 percent jump over pre-COVID-19 levels.  During the quarter, the company opened 795 new stores to take the total store count to 16,617.  &amp;quot;The quarter was marked by an operating environment at par with pre-COVID levels as the impact&nbsp;of pandemic waned,&amp;quot; RIL said.  The oil-to-chemical major said that across town classes, consumer sentiments remained positive on the back of&nbsp;key promotional events and early onset of festivities.  &amp;quot;Overall, the results reflect strong operational execution that keeps it well poised to deliver sustainable&nbsp;growth in the period ahead,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  The oil and gas production business of RIL benefitted from the surge in domestic administered natural gas prices during the quarter.  RIL reported a 134.4 percent year-on-year surge in revenues to Rs 3,853 crore, driven by higher realisation for the natural gas that the company produces from difficult-to-produce fields.  Operating&nbsp;profit of the segment nearly tripled on a year-on-year basis to Rs 3,171 crore in the quarter while operating margins rose 17.2 percentage points to 82.3 percent.  During the quarter, RIL produced 43.6 billions of cubic feet equivalent as against 52 billions of cubic feet equivalent in the year ago quarter.  Media  The media and broadcasting business reported a 11.7 percent year-on-year growth in revenues to Rs 1,549 crore during the reported quarter.  The segment's operating profit plummeted 87.4 percent on-year to Rs 32 crore while operating margins shrank to 2.1 percent from 18.2 percent a year-ago.  RIL said that the business faced&nbsp;issues&nbsp;from a challenging&nbsp;advertising environment, flat subscription revenue and advertisement revenue loss from removal of Hindi GEC&nbsp;from DD FreeDish.  &amp;quot;Advertising environment during the quarter was subdued as brands held back advertising spends on&nbsp;new product launches and sustenance campaigns due to the continued inflationary headwinds,&amp;quot; RIL said.  On October 21, shares of Reliance Industries ended 1.2 percent lower at Rs 2,470 on the NSE.  (Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Sequentially, revenue increased by 3 percent.  Performance was driven by higher net customer additions and an increase in average revenue per user.  The average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month saw a healthy 23.5 percent growth compared to the year-ago period due to better seasonality and improving subscriber mix, Reliance Industries said in its BSE filing.

Jio aims to complete its pan India 5G rollout by December 2023.  Meanwhile, Jio Platforms clocked a healthy 26.9 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 4,729 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, backed topline as well as operating performance.  The revenue from operations grew by 22.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 24,275 crore driven by an ARPU increase for the connectivity business.  At the operating level, Jio Platforms recorded a 29.2 percent year-on-year increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Rs 12,011 crore led by strong revenue growth and margin improvement.  The margin at 49.5 percent increased by 250 bps YoY due to ARPU's increase in connectivity business partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs, Reliance said. The sequential increase in EBITDA was 5 percent and the margin expanded by 80 bps.  Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The company is likely to report a 12 percent on-year increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 15,263 crore in the September quarter, according to the average of estimates by six securities firms.  The company will report its September quarter earnings on October 21.  Profit will be driven by strong consolidated revenue, which is expected to rise 34 percent on year on year to Rs 2.25 lakh crore in the quarter.    Revenue will be aided by strength in the energy business, which will benefit from better gross refining margins and strong demand compared to the year-ago quarter.  A robust performance by the telecom and retail business, in particular, will boost on-year revenue.  The retail business should have benefited from strong footfalls and demand compared to the year-ago quarter, when the business was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Full reopening of the economy in the quarter gone by, along with strong festive demand, should have helped the retail business deliver strong sales growth.  Energy business&nbsp;  While the year-on-year performance of RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemical vertical will be strong, its sequential growth could have been soft due to a decline in global gross refining margins from their lifetime highs in the June quarter as well as the imposition of additional duties on the export of refining products imposed by the government.  &ldquo;Energy markets have been volatile in the past quarter, and windfall taxes added to challenges,&rdquo; Morgan Stanley, which has an &lsquo;overweight&rsquo; rating on RIL, wrote in a preview on the earnings.  Morgan Stanley said RIL&rsquo;s earnings may have fallen sequentially as the oil-to-chemicals business was affected by refinery shutdowns, the windfall fuel export tax, and lower product cracks.  Singapore&rsquo;s Gross Refining Margin (GRM), a key benchmark to gauge refining margins in Asia, plummeted 51 percent sequentially to $9.1 per barrel in the September quarter because of a decline in gasoline and fuel oil cracks.  The sharp decline in the Singapore GRM will have an impact on RIL&rsquo;s margin, but continued strength in middle distillate products like diesel and air turbine fuel should have offset some of the impact, analysts said.  Retail and telecom&nbsp;  Analysts expect no surprises in the earnings performance of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm in the September quarter. On a sequential basis, both verticals are expected to have performed well, driven by high customer acquisitions in telecom and strong footfalls in retail.  IIFL Securities sees the retail segment registering 36 percent on-year growth in sales and a 7.5 percent core margin in the September quarter.  On the telecom side, acquisition of new customers and recent tariff hikes should result in 3-5 percent sequential growth in revenue.  Analysts expect the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of Reliance Jio to rise 1.9 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis from Rs 176 reported in the previous quarter.  Jio is estimated to have added more than 9 million net new users in the September quarter, analysts said.  &ldquo;Sequential ARPU improvement is backed by residual impact of the past tariff hike (higher proportion of longer-dated plans),&rdquo; Emkay Global Financial Services said.

With the investment, the entity will become a joint venture and will be capitalised with over USD 200 million of cash to fund growth.  &amp;quot;Sanmina Corporation, a leading integrated manufacturing solutions company and Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (RSBVL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), India's largest private sector company, today announced they have completed the previously announced joint venture transaction,&amp;quot; a joint statement by the two companies said on Tuesday.  RSBVL had a revenue of Rs 1,478.1 crore (USD 194.9 million) and a net profit of Rs 179.8 crore for the year ended March 2022. It had a total investment of Rs 10,857.7 crore at the end of March 2022, the statement said.  The joint venture will leverage Sanmina's 40 years of advanced manufacturing experience and Reliance's expertise and leadership in the Indian business ecosystem. The day-to-day business will continue to be managed by Sanmina's management team in Chennai.  &amp;quot;The joint venture will create a world-class electronic manufacturing hub in India. The joint venture will prioritise high technology infrastructure hardware, for growth markets, and across industries such as communications networking (5G, cloud infrastructure, hyperscale datacentres), medical and healthcare systems, industrial and cleantech, and defence and aerospace,&amp;quot; the statement said.  In addition to supporting Sanmina's current customer base, the joint venture will create a 'Manufacturing Technology Centre of Excellence' that will serve as an incubation centre to support the product development and hardware start-up ecosystem in India as well as promote research and innovation of leading-edge technologies.  All the manufacturing will take place at Sanmina's 100-acre campus in Chennai, with the ability for site expansion to support future growth opportunities as well as to potentially expand to new manufacturing sites in India over time, based on business needs, the statement said.

Ambani was speaking at the India Mobile Congress (IMC) 2022 event, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi &ldquo;launched&rdquo; 5G tech in India.  He also said that India&rsquo;s telecom industry is &ldquo;ready to take leadership&rdquo; and that government action is &ldquo;crafting India into the 5G era, this is more than the next-gen of telecom&rdquo;.  Follow our LIVE coverage of PM Modi&rsquo;s 5G launch in India  Read the text of Ambani&rsquo;s full special address at the IMC event below:  Most respected Prime Minister Shri Narendrabhai Modiji,  Honourable Minister Shri Vaishnawji,  Honourable Minister of State Shri Chauhanji,  Secretary Telecom Shri Rajaramanji,  My good friends from the industry, Sunil and Kumar,  Distinguished delegates,  Ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning.  My hearty congratulations to DoT and COAI for organising the sixth edition of the Indian Mobile Congress.  I can whole-heartedly say today that as Indian telecom industry, what we have demonstrated, I feel very proud. And to both COAI and DoT I can say that we are now ready to take leadership and the Indian Mobile Congress should now become the Asian Mobile Congress and the Global Mobile Congress.  Today is also very special because it coincides with our national celebration of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav.  Our beloved Prime Minister, Shri Narendrabhai Modi ji, has shared an inspiring vision of making India a developed nation by 2047. Every policy and every action of the government is skillfully crafted to propel India towards that goal.  The steps taken to fast-track India&rsquo;s march into the 5G era provide a compelling proof of our Prime Minister&rsquo;s determination. This is most heartening because 5G is much more than the next generation of connectivity technology. To my mind, It is a foundational technology that unlocks the full potential of other 21st century technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Robotics, Blockchain, and Metaverse.  In fact, I think of 5G as an acronym for &ldquo;5 Goals&rdquo; that fundamentally can transform our nation:  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5G and 5G-enabled digital solutions can bring affordable and high-quality education and skill development within the reach of common Indians. This will help young Indians realise their full potential by arming them with world class capabilities and competencies so that they can earn more and make India globally competitive.  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5G can affordably deliver high-quality healthcare to rural and remote areas by turning existing hospitals into smart hospitals without much additional investment. This will make services of best doctors digitally available anywhere in India, dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of diagnostics, and enable real-time clinical decision making. All this will enhance health, wealth and happiness of all Indians.  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5G can bridge the gap between urban and rural India by accelerating digitisation and intelligent data management of Agriculture, Services, Trade, Industry, Informal Sector, Transportation and Energy Infrastructure. This will create huge efficiencies in all economic activities, making India a hub of innovations, and also help us mitigate the climate crisis.  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5G can make available the same powerful productivity tools to small-scale industry and commercial enterprises as are used by large capital-intensive businesses. This will drive modernisation and profitability of all sectors of India&rsquo;s economy.  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By bringing Artificial Intelligence into every domain, 5G can power India&rsquo;s emergence as the world&rsquo;s intelligence capital. This will help India become a major exporter of high-value added digital solutions and services.  Achieving these five goals will trigger a huge explosion of entrepreneurship in our country, which in turn will attract even larger investments and create millions of new jobs for our young people.  By harnessing the combined power of demography and digital technologies, India can become the world&rsquo;s leading digital society, setting a benchmark for simultaneously achieving the dual goals of acceleration of growth and inclusion in development &ndash; acceleration of growth by making India a 40-trillion-dollar economy by 2047, up from $3 trillion today, and inclusion in development by increasing our per capita income rapidly to over $20,000, from $2,000 today.  Therefore, it will not be an exaggeration to say that 5G is like a Digital Kamadhenu, the heavenly cow that grants whatever we desire.  Esteemed dignitaries,  The rollout of 5G in India is not an ordinary event in India&rsquo;s telecom history. It carries the keen expectations and the high aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians. With 5G, India will take longer and faster strides towards Sab Ka Digital Saath and Sab Ka Digital Vikas.&nbsp; India may have started a little late, but I want to assure all of you, we will finish first by rolling out 5G services across the length and breadth of India. And as an industry, we will ensure that we have the highest quality and the most affordable rates than anyone else has in the world.  Today, I want to reiterate Jio&rsquo;s commitment to deliver 5G to every town, every taluka, and every tehsil of our country by December 2023. Most of Jio&rsquo;s 5G is developed in India, and hence carries the stamp of Atmanirbhar Bharat.  On this occasion, I would like to congratulate Honourable Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw ji and the Government of India for their efforts to strengthen BSNL. A strong BSNL will bring the balancing presence of a government entity in this very strategic sector.  Most Respected Pradhan Mantri ji,  Before I conclude, I would like to express a deep-seated emotion of pride in my heart. A pride felt by every Indian. Your leadership has raised India&rsquo;s prestige, profile and power globally like never before. In today&rsquo;s fast-changing world, there will be no stopping a resurgent India from soaring to the top &ndash; a place that is rightfully ours. India and Indians can&rsquo;t settle for anything less. All of us at the Indian Mobile Congress assure you that we will work together and walk together under your guidance towards the glorious future that awaits our nation.  Thank you. Happy Navaratri to all of you and all my fellow Indians.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Reliance Industries Ltd chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani reaffirmed his commitment to new energy during the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 29.  Ambani said &ldquo;achieving carbon neutrality globally will require multi decade of investments to the tune of $5 trillion per year, which makes Reliance&rsquo;s new energy vision far more transformational and far more global&rdquo;.  The company plans to invest Rs 75,000 crore in new energy.  &ldquo;We have made rapid progress to create an advanced manufacturing ecosystem for new energy, which will be fully integrated, backed by world-class talent, built on pillars of technological innovation through strategic partnerships, to deliver modular, at scale, affordable and most modern manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world,&rdquo; Ambani said.  Market experts said that Reliance&rsquo;s big plans will ensure that the company stays highly valued even as the traditional fossil fuel companies struggle to keep their companies from getting de-rated because of ESG concerns.  Baring this year, as several companies saw stock price head higher because of a surge in oil prices and refining markets, the perception of fossil fuel companies remains poor as the world moves with greater resolve toward new energy to reduce carbon footprint.  &ldquo;We are aiming for continuous hyper-growth over many decades from new energy and to establish India as a world leader in new energy advanced manufacturing&rdquo;, the RIL chairman said.

Its strategic acquisitions of Lithium Werks, Faradion and a stake in Ambri have provided the company with differentiated and superior battery chemistries.  The company intends to set up battery-pack facility by 2023, scale it to 5GWh annual cell to pack manufacturing by 2024 and further scale it up to 50GWh by 2027.

It has set the ball rolling to establish Giga scale gH2 manufacturing in India.  The company will also establish 20 GW solar generation capacity by 2025&ndash;for round-the-clock and intermittent power for gH2.  Green hydrogen&nbsp;is generated from electrolysis of water, with the entire process run on renewable energy.  Also read: Reliance Industries AGM 2022: RIL to build gigacomplex for power electronics  De-rating of oil companies  The traditional oil manufacturing companies the world over face the risk of getting de-rated in the event of a fall in crude prices, as future growth is likely to shift to new energy.  Even though these companies will continue to generate cash, as oil will continue to find usage the world over for years to come, these companies are likely to see a continued de-rating on future growth concerns.  Until last year, most global oil companies, including giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobile, were trading at low earnings multiples and high dividend yields because of poor investor perception.  But the story may be vastly different for Reliance, despite its dominance in the oil business. Its mega plans of becoming a global leader in new energy businesses, experts feel will not only help the company achieve its target of becoming carbon-neutral but also aid in avoiding a possible de-rating of the stock.  Also read: Mukesh Ambani explains the &lsquo;Founder's Mindset&rsquo; for the success of RIL  RIL future-ready  Reliance has credibly proved its capability to diversify into other businesses from its traditional oil &amp;amp;amp; gas business. Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail provide ample proof of it. But the new energy business plans ensure a multi-year growth engine even as the investor perception improves rather than deteriorates.  &ldquo;With the new energy mega plan, Reliance is again going to do it directly into the new energy ecosystems which are going to replace conventional oil ecosystems,&rdquo; said Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital.  &ldquo;The full span from solar energy production to hydrogen technology and battery grid for energy storage makes it likely that Reliance might get entrenched in the new energy ecosystem&rdquo;.  Gupta is of the opinion that the company&rsquo;s return ratios could dip in the medium term while the ramp up of new tech is going on but it is unlikely that the stock will face any de-rating.  &ldquo;However, the market will give credit for the capital work in progress and a premium for the new clean-tech keeping in mind that whenever Reliance has entered a new arena it has become a keystone species in that new ecosystem,&rdquo; Gupta said.

Investors and analysts have come to expect major announcements from the conglomerate. Last year, it was the entry into green energy, and the year before, it was the induction of Google as a minority investor. In 2016, it was the launch of telecom services.  Time and Date  The AGM will be held via video conferencing for the third consecutive year on August 29. The meeting will start at 2:00 pm IST, with addresses and presentations expected from chairman Mukesh Ambani and other members of the company&rsquo;s board and subsidiaries.  Also Read |&nbsp;Reliance to hold its 45th AGM on August 29: All you need to know  The board of directors and shareholders will then vote on 11 resolutions. Six of them are special resolutions, including the appointment of Hital Meswani as a whole-time director, and the insertion of clauses in its articles of association with respect to its new energy business.  Stock Movement  Reliance shares tend to move considerably ahead of and after the AGM. The shares have averaged negligible returns a week prior to the AGM, based on data of the past 10 years. However, they rose almost 4 percent a week after the event, Bloomberg data showed.  Additionally, the shares gained 2.3 percent a month before the AGM and returned more than 6 percent a month after the event, the data showed.  Trading in the stock tends to pick up around the annual event. On average, daily volumes on the counter have spiked 317 percent on the day of the AGM over the past five years. AGM day is easily the most active for the stock.  Big Expectations  As with every Reliance AGM, investors have a set of expectations.  This year, the focus will be on the consumer retail business once again, after chatter that a time line is likely to be announced for the listing of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail. The induction of private equity investors in both its consumer-facing subsidiaries in 2020 was seen as a stepping stone towards their eventual listing.  Brokerage JP Morgan India said in a recent note that Reliance has enhanced disclosures around related-party transactions, which is seen as a step towards greater transparency ahead of the listing.  &ldquo;While it is too early to say if the increased disclosures on the large transactions between the subsidiaries are a step on the road to the listing of these businesses, it would be seen as a positive,&rdquo; JP Morgan said.  Another key expectation will be around the new energy business, which emerged as the biggest takeaway at last year&rsquo;s AGM. Reliance has since invested in acquiring companies in the segment and expanding capacity.  The company plans to build four gigafactories to manufacture solar panels, electric batteries, green hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells with an investment of $80 billion. The company sees renewable energy and green hydrogen as tectonic shifts in meeting the world&rsquo;s energy demands.  In the company&rsquo;s annual report, Ambani said he expects the green energy business to be the crown jewel of the company in the next seven years, much like he heralded the consumer-facing businesses about seven years ago.  Brokerage JM Financial said investors will await any indication of the induction of strategic investors in the company&rsquo;s oil-to-chemicals and green energy business as Relance steps up activity in the space.  Attention will also be on Reliance&rsquo;s plan to roll out 5G mobile phone services after the company mopped up the most spectrum in the recent auction. Reliance invested $11.3 billion to acquire 25 gigahertz of spectrum from the government.  Investors will wait for indications of the pricing of the new 5G services that step-down subsidiary Reliance Jio will offer.  Traders can expect good moves in the stock if the company were to make announcements with respect to these expectations, said dealers.  Beyond AGM  Reliance&rsquo;s June quarter performance was slightly underwhelming, given the expectations built up due to the surge in global refining margins. The introduction of a special additional excise duty on refining exports also dampened spirits, but analysts remain buoyed over the stock&rsquo;s prospects.  Of 39 brokerages covering the company, 31 have an outright &lsquo;buy&rsquo; rating on the stock while three have a &lsquo;hold&rsquo; rating with an average upside of about 12 percent expected in the scrip over the next 12 months.  UBS Securities upgraded the stock recently to a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; from &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; as it factored in opportunities in the green energy business, which it said could create additional value of $35 billion for the company by 2030.

The oil-to-telecom giant reported a&nbsp;54.5 percent on-year growth in consolidated revenue from operations to Rs&nbsp;2.23 lakh crore,&nbsp;which was also below Street's estimate of Rs 2.4 lakh crore.  &amp;quot;Despite significant challenges posed by the tight crude markets and higher energy and freight costs, O2C business has delivered its best performance ever. I am also happy with the progress of our Consumer platforms,&amp;quot; said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani in a press statement.  RIL reported a 45.8 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated operating profit to a record high of Rs 40,179 crore for the quarter ended June.  Refining and Petrochemical  The strength in the company's June quarter performance came from the&nbsp;refining and petrochemical&nbsp;division which posted its highest ever quarterly revenue aided by a tight global energy market.  The segment reported 56.7 percent on-year growth in revenues to Rs 1.6 lakh crore aided by strong gross refining margins in the international market.  &amp;quot;Despite significant challenges posed by the tight crude markets and higher energy and freight costs, O2C business has delivered its best performance eve,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  The operating performance of the segment was strong as operating profit jumped 62.6 percent on-year to Rs 19,888 crore.  The embargo by the European Union on Russian oil products, higher gas to oil switching, strong travel demand and lower product inventory levels resulted in tight fuel markets, RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  The vertical performed strongly in the June quarter with revenues rising 183 percent on-year to Rs 3,625 crore aided by higher administered gas prices for the domestic market.  The company said that KGD6 gas production during the June quarter was at 40.6 billion cubic feet as against&nbsp;33.1 billion cubic feet in the year-ago quarter. Average gas price realized by RIL for KGD6 gas was at $ 9.72&nbsp;per mmBtu&nbsp;as against&nbsp;$3.62&nbsp;per mmBtu&nbsp;in the year-ago quarter.  The segment's operating profit&nbsp;soared 243.4 percent on-year to Rs 2,737 crore largely because of higher volumes and realisations in the quarter.  The oil and gas business witnessed higher revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization driven by higher gas price and production.  RIL said that in its KG D6-MJ Gas and Condensate fields the final offshore subsea production installation campaign is underway and is likely to be completed by the second quarter of FY23. The company is also planning to start drilling for exploration at the KG UDW1 well next year.  &ldquo;The whole idea is, any resources that we can create, we can monetize the existing infrastructure. So the prospect maturation is underway and we expect to undertake an exploration (for KG UDW1) next year. Once the energy field is commissioned, we should be progressively moving towards delivering more than 1 bcf per day by FY24,&rdquo; said Sanjay Roy, senior vice-president for exploration and production.  Outlook  RIL pegs oil demand to average 99.2 million barrel per day globally, up1.7 million barrel per day year-on-year.  &ldquo;There is limited spare refining capacity and the strong oil demand will keep refining margins higher. There is clear recovery in aviation demand because the pandemic is subsiding. There are lower exports from China which are supporting margins,&rdquo; V Shrikanth, joint chief financial officer said. He added that certain petrochemical products may see range bound margins due to capacity overhang.  He said that transport fuel demand globally is likely to remain strong. Polymer and polyester demand is likely to pick up with the upcoming festival season.  &ldquo;On the challenges side, we have been seeing the whole concern of recession, slowdown on the back of both higher prices as well as the responses by various central banks all over the world wanting to take interest rates up to curb inflation&hellip;Any duty on exports you know will have an impact on overall realization that we have,&rdquo; Shrikanth said.  Jio Platforms  The consumer technology business, which houses the telecom operations, reported a 23.8 percent on-year growth in revenue from operations to Rs 23,467 crore.  Net subscriber addition witnessed a strong rebound to 9.7 million in the June quarter driven by continued strength in gross additions at&nbsp;35.2 million and reduced SIM consolidation impact, the company said.  Average revenue per user saw 4.8 percent sequential rise to Rs 175.7 as the company benefited from the tariff hikes undertaken last year.  The segment's operating profit jumped 28.5 percent on-year to Rs 11,424 crore on healthy subscriber addition and realisations.  Reliance Retail  The first COVID-19 restriction free quarter helped RIL's organised retail business to thrive as footfalls improved even though ongoing inflationary environment capped performance.  The segment reported a 53.7 percent on-year rise in revenue from operations to Rs 51,582 crore in the reported quarter. &amp;quot;Consumer spending got a boost as families indulged in leisure activities, socializing, festivities and shopping as COVID situation improved though sentiments remained cautious due to inflationary concerns,&amp;quot; RIL said.  RIL said that footfalls were recorded at 175 million for the June quarter, which was 19&nbsp;percent above pre-COVID levels as consumers returned to stores.  &amp;quot;Consumer sentiments remain positive, though a bit cautious on the discretionary spend due to the inflation concerns,&amp;quot; said Gaurav Jain, head (strategy and business development) at Reliance Retail.  The segment's operating profit jumped 180.4 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 3,897 crore aided by a low base of the year-ago quarter, which was disrupted by&nbsp;second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Reliance Retail's operating margisn improved sharply to 7.6 percent in the reported quarter from 4.1 percent in the year ago quarter and 7.1 percent in the previous quarter.  The strong demand environment and expansion of store saw net profit of the retail segment rise 114.2 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 2,061 crore in the reported quarter.  Earlier today, shares of RIL ended 0.7 percent higher at Rs 2,502.95 on the National Stock Exchange.  Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

ARPU &amp;amp;amp; Customer Base  The growth in revenues during the quarter was driven by an increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) as well as a modest addition to its subscriber base.  The ARPU during the quarter stood at Rs 175.7 per subscriber per month with a YoY growth of 27 percent while sequentially the ARPU improved by 4.8 percent. This was a result of higher customer engagement and increase in traffic.  The company was able to add 9.7 million customers on a net basis which was driven by continued strength in gross additions which stood at 35.2 million during the quarter. The impact of SIM consolidation witnessed a decline as compared to the previous quarters.  Reliance Jio is ranked number 1 telecom operator in India with a subscriber base of 419.9 million as at the end of Q1FY23 and has a market leadership with 53 percent of wireless broadband market share in May 2022.  Data Consumption  The average data and voice consumption per user per month during the quarter increased to 20.8 GB and 1,001 minutes respectively.

Margins  EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter grew 27.2 percent to Rs 10,964 crore as compared to Rs 8,617 crore achieved during the same period a year ago.

The brokerage firm said that its rating upgrade is driven by improvement in earnings outlook of the refining and upstream gas business as well as the consumer technology businesses&rsquo; valuations holding.  JP Morgan believes RIL&rsquo;s outperformance to the Nifty 50 will continue in 2022 given that there is a good chance of upgrades to Street&rsquo;s earnings expectations for the company. The brokerage has raised its earnings per share estimate for RIL by 19 percent for 2022-23 and 17 percent for 2023-24.  &ldquo;Our earnings estimates imply a sharp pullback in diesel and gasoline cracks from current record level, but RIL remains among the best positioned refiners globally, given: ability to buy and process arbitrage barrels, diesel heavy slate and, export focus,&rdquo; JP Morgan India said in a note on June 16.  Another key factor behind the brokerage firm&rsquo;s altered view on the stock is the lack of correction in the valuations of RIL&rsquo;s consumer technology businesses. &ldquo;We had earlier expected the global Tech sell-off to impact RIL&rsquo;s consumer valuations negatively (Jio, Retail) and cancel out the near-term earnings upside,&rdquo; the brokerage house said.  JP Morgan said that likely higher average revenue per user for the telecom business and ramp-up in footprint of the organized retail operations combined with renewables business optionality, non-energy business valuations should hold up going ahead.  With respect to the upcoming annual general meeting of the oil-to-telecom major, JP Morgan said expectations center around potential demerger or initial public offering of consumer-facing businesses.  &ldquo;We do not expect any concrete timelines from this year&rsquo;s AGM on the consumer businesses IPOs (Jio, Retail), even though media reports have talked about IPOs of these businesses,&rdquo; JP Morgan India said.

The energy sector giant, which has operations in telecom and organized retail as well, reported a 22.5 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit&nbsp;at Rs 16,203 crore for the&nbsp;given&nbsp;quarter, which missed analysts&rsquo; expectations on account of a one-time impairment charge.  However, the conglomerate&rsquo;s consolidated revenues soared 36.8 percent on-year to Rs 2.1 lakh crore for the March quarter, which was in-line with Street&rsquo;s expectations driven by higher sales in the traditional energy business.  RIL&rsquo;s operating performance in the quarter was the highlight as consolidated operating profit jumped 27.7 percent on-year to Rs 33,968 crore, comfortable beating even the most optimistic estimate among the six brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.  &ldquo;One of best earnings growth stories among India&rsquo;s large-caps,&rdquo; said brokerage firm CLSA India as it raised its earnings per share (EPS) forecast for the next two years by 5-9 percent on account of higher margins in the refining business.  The refining business was the key driver of the performance for RIL in the March quarter as the segment&rsquo;s operating profit surged 25 percent on-year while revenues grew over 44 percent from the year-ago quarter.  Brokerage firm Jefferies India said that the refining business looks strong in 2022 due to geopolitical developments while the cash-cow petrochemical business could see challenges on account of lockdown in China.  &ldquo;With earnings boosted by energy inflation, RIL could act as a safe haven in today's context,&rdquo; Jefferies India said as it retained its &ldquo;buy&rdquo; rating on the stock.  Brokerage Goldman Sachs India expects the earnings momentum for RIL to pick up sharply in the coming quarters, which will help drive upgrades in Street&rsquo;s earnings estimate for the company. RIL&rsquo;s stock performance in the past has been closely correlated to Street&rsquo;s views on its earnings outlook.  Goldman Sachs expects 50 percent growth in operating profit of RIL in 2022-23 and 21 percent rise in 2023-24. Further, the brokerage firm expects full integration of JioMart with WhatsApp to also drive stock performance.  On May 6, shares of Reliance Industries closed 0.5 percent at Rs 2,628 on the National Stock Exchange.  Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate's consolidated revenue from operations surged 36.8 percent year-on-year to Rs&nbsp;2.1 lakh crore for the reported quarter, which met Street's estimate of Rs 2.1 lakh crore.  The company's board also recommended a dividend of Rs 8&nbsp;per share for the financial year ended March 31, 2022.  For FY22, RIL reported a record-high gross revenues of Rs 7.92 lakh crore or $104.6 billion, making it the first Indian company to achieve the $100-billion revenue mark. RIL also reported record annual consolidated net profit of Rs 67,845 crore for the financial year.  &amp;quot;Despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and heightened geo-political uncertainties, Reliance has delivered a robust performance in FY2021-22,&amp;quot; Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said in a press statement.  &amp;quot;I am pleased to report strong growth in our Digital Services and Retail segments. Our O2C business has proven its resilience and has demonstrated strong recovery despite volatility in the energy markets,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  Business performance  The strong topline growth of the company was driven by the oil-to-chemical business, which reported a 44.3 percent on-year&nbsp;growth in sales&nbsp;followed by the retail business where revenues jumped 23.2 percent.  The oil-to-chemical business' growth was driven by the refining side of the operations, where surging global refining margins during the quarter aided the company's performance.  The strong topline performance reflected in RIL's operating show as well, with consolidated operating profit jumping 27.7 percent on-year to Rs 33,968 crore.  Oil-to-chemicals  The refining and petrochemicals business of Reliance Industries had a stellar showing in the March quarter aided by tightness in the global refning market that pushed margins higher.  The operating profit of the oil-to-chemicals segment surged nearly 25 percent on-year to Rs 14,241 crore, led by multi-quarter high transportation fuel cracks, which was partially offset by lower polymer and intermediates margins and higher energy cost.    Overall surge in global&nbsp;crude oil prices drove the 44 percent sales growth in the segment, which was also supported by volume growth of 4.2 percent on steady recovery in demand.  &amp;quot;O2C was firm despite volatility caused due to the Ukraine conflict. Strength in fuel cracks offset by the weakness in the downstream chemical margins and high energy cost,&amp;quot; said&nbsp;Shrikanth Venkatachari, the joint chief financial officer of Reliance Industries at a press meet.  However,&nbsp;operating margin for the quarter in the O2C segment declined by 150 basis points on-year&nbsp;to 9.8&nbsp;percent. &amp;quot;This was primarily due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Jio&nbsp;Platforms  The digital services business of RIL continued its strong showing led by the telecom business, which reported 8 percent sequential growth in revenues and 15.4 percent on-quarter rise in net profit.  Operating&nbsp;profit of the digital segment grew 27.4 percent on-year to Rs 10,918 crore and contributed a third of the quarter's consolidated operating profit.  The average revenue per user of the telecom business jumped 10.5 percent on-quarter to Rs 167.6, reflecting the benefits from tariff hikes taken by the company last year.  The telecom subscriber base stood at 410.2 million at the end of the March quarter as the company lost 10.9 million users during the quarter due to ongoing consolidation of the user base.  Reliance Retail  The organised retail business had a resilient performance in the reported quarter despite the threat from the spread of Omicron variant of COVID-19 earlier in the quarter.  Topline of the segment rose 23.1 percent to record quarterly sales of Rs 50,834 crore. &amp;quot;The headwinds posed by the COVID situation in January were offset by the robust growth in February and March as the business leveraged festive events and early setting of summer season,&amp;quot; RIL said.  While operating profit in the retail segment grew 16.3 percent on-year to Rs 3,584 crore, operating margins shrank 40 basis points to 4.1 percent reflecting the impact of high inflation.  RIL said it opened 793 stores during the March quarter and saw double-digit growth in all consumption baskets. The digital side of the business saw good traction in the year as daily orders more than doubled on a year-on-year basis.  &amp;quot;Grocery business continued its growth momentum and delivered its best ever quarter driven by strong growth across its store formats, digital and new commerce platforms,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas  The revival in the company's oil and gas business continued aided by a favourable business environment given the surge in international natural gas and crude oil prices.  Revenues of the segment rose 137 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 2,008 crore while operating profit rose more than three-fold to Rs 1,556 crore.  The gas production from KGD6 fields during the reported quarter was at 37.7&nbsp;billion cubic feet (RIL&rsquo;s share) as against 15 billion cubic feet in the year ago quarter.  RIL's average realisation for its natural gas rose to $6.1 per mmBtu during the quarter from $3.99 per mmBtu in the year-ago quarter.  On May 6, shares of&nbsp;Reliance Industries ended 0.5 percent lower at Rs 2,628 on the National Stock Exchange. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Average revenue per user (ARPU) saw a healthy rise of 10.6 percent to Rs 167.6, which beat street estimates. Subscriber base though continued to shrink by 10.8 million in the fourth quarter.  ",,"Reliance Jio Infocom, Results, video",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/results/reliance-jio-profitability-improvestariff-hikeuser-base-shrinks-further_16348921.html,"Reliance Industries&rsquo; subsidiary Reliance Jio posted an in-line performance in the fourth quarter of FY22 with a net profit at Rs 4,173 crore compared to Rs 3,615 crore in Q3. Revenues jumped to Rs 20,901 crore from 19,347 crore in the last quarter. In terms of profitability, the telecom giant crossed key landmarks with EBITDA over Rs 10,000 crore while margin surpassed the 50-percent mark.  Reliance Jio&rsquo;s average revenue per user (ARPU) beat estimates with a healthy 10.6 percent QoQ growth at Rs 167.6. Tariff hike of 20 percent has kicked in for profitability improvement for the company. Better subscriber mix has also aided in the ARPU performance.    &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Subscriber base for Jio continued to shrink ending at 410.2 million at the end of March, 2022 from 440.6 million at the end of the first quarter of the fiscal. Management said, &ldquo;SIM consolidation post tariff hike resulting in net subscriber reduction.&rdquo; Jio also highlighted, &ldquo;Recent trends indicate that SIM consolidation is abating as tariff hike impact is absorbed.&rdquo;  Customer engagement grew for the telecom service provider with data traffic growth of 47.5 percent YoY to 24.6 Exabytes during the fourth quarter. Per capita data grew at 48.1 percent to 19.7 GB compared to last fiscal. Average voice calls grew 17.6 percent on a year-on-year basis to 968 minutes per month.  &ldquo;JioFiber has captured the largest broadband service provider position within two years of its launch,&rdquo; said the management. JioFiber clocks in a total of 6 million connected premises with an average five hours of daily endgame to on the set-top-box.  Tariff hike in the telecom sector has provided the much needed boost to Jio&rsquo;s performance but the decline on the subscriber front has been a concern for the analysts. However, management&rsquo;s positive commentary on abating of subscriber reduction with tariff hike being absorbed is expected to allay concerns on this front."

The conglomerate is expected to report a 38 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 17,167 crore for the quarter ended March, according to an average of six brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.  The company&rsquo;s consolidated revenues are likely to rise 43 percent on year to Rs 2.1 lakh crore for the reported quarter driven in large part by a bump in earnings of the refining business.  Analysts expect the refining business of RIL to benefit from the surge in global gross refining margins triggered by sanctions imposed on Russia&rsquo;s oil exports by Western economies following the country&rsquo;s invasion of Europe.  Singapore benchmark gross refining margins soared 350 percent on year, and 32 percent on quarter, to $8.1 per barrel in the March quarter that will significantly boost RIL&rsquo;s earnings from selling refining products.  Further, the surge in prices of middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel during the quarter triggered by high demand and supply disruptions would further aid earnings of the legacy business of the conglomerate.  &ldquo;Notwithstanding the stock&rsquo;s upmove from its recent lows, we believe the strength in refining is being under-estimated, with RIL particularly well-placed in the current environment given a combination of high diesel yield, high diesel output, high export ratio, and high complexity,&rdquo; said brokerage firm Citigroup India in a recent note.  That said, the performance of the oil-to-chemical business is likely to be tempered by the weakness in margins of the petrochemical division because of higher crude oil prices as well as declining international margins for key products.  Robust Telecom Growth  The telecom operations of RIL will also provide strong support to earnings with brokerage firm Jefferies India expecting a 10 percent sequential rise in revenues.  The surge in revenues will be driven by the full impact of recent tariff hikes undertaken by the industry recently with Reliance Jio Infocomm&rsquo;s average revenue per user likely to rise by 9-12 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.  However, the churn in subscriber base of Reliance Jio is likely to continue in the reported quarter with analysts expecting the company to lose more than 9 million users as it reduces the presence of inactive and low revenue users.  Retail Recovery  Brokerage firm BofA Securities expects the growth momentum for Reliance Retail to improve in the March quarter despite the impact of localized lockdowns in the early part of the quarter due to the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.  &ldquo;We expect the business momentum to pick-up and expect 30% YoY growth on low-base effect of lock-downs easing up. We also expect the momentum of online apps JioMart and AJIO to be strong,&rdquo; BofA Securities said.  Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley India expects revenues to rise 15 percent sequentially with similar sequential rise in operating profits. However, the operating performance is likely to be muted on a year-on-year basis due to impact of high competition in the sector and high inflation.

Shares of Walgreens, which also owns Duane Reade and Mexico&rsquo;s Benavides, were up 1.8% at 1:38 p.m., valuing the Deerfield, Illinois-based business at almost $39 billion.  Walgreens kicked off the sale of Boots earlier this year. It&rsquo;s drawn interest from private equity firms including Apollo Global Management Inc. and TDR Capital. It also attracted Bain Capital and CVC Capital Partners, who teamed up and were considered early favorites before abandoning their pursuit.  Walgreens is considering a potential initial public offering of Boots, which runs a chain of roughly 2,200 stores in the U.K. that includes brands such as No7 Beauty Company, if buyout interest is muted, Bloomberg News reported previously.  The U.S.-based company is expected to make a decision in the coming weeks and may decide to keep a minority stake in Boots in any transaction, the people said.  Boots also has smaller operations in Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands and Thailand, as well as an optician business and a suite of private-label beauty and personal-care brands that could be included in a sale.

The government-dictated price for natural gas produced in the country is to be revised on April 1 and factoring in the spike in energy prices witnessed last year, the rate paid for gas produced from fields given to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on nomination basis is likely to rise to $5.93 per million British thermal units from current $2.9.  Simultaneously, difficult fields like the ones in Reliance and its partner bp plc operated D6 block in KG basin, are likely to get $9.9-10.1 price compared to the current rate of $6.13, two sources aware of the matter said.  These are the highest rates for administered/regulated fields (like ONGC&rsquo;s Bassein field off the Mumbai coast) and free-market areas (such as the KG basin).  Also, this will be the second increase in rates since April 2019 and comes on the back of firming benchmark international prices.  The government sets the price of gas every six months &mdash; on April 1 and October 1 &mdash; each year based on rates prevalent in gas surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia in one year with a lag of one quarter.  So, the price for April 1 to September 30 is based on the average price from January 2021 to December 2021.  This is the period when global rates shot through the roofs.  The volume-weighted average of the price prevalent in a 12-month period in US-based Henry Hub, Canada-based Alberta gas, UK-based NBP and Russia gas are used to fix price for administered fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd.  For difficult fields like discoveries in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and high pressure-high temperature areas, a slightly modified formula is used by incorporating the price of LNG, which too had shot through the roof in 2021.  Reliance-bp operated KG fields are classified as difficult fields.  The sources said the increase in gas price is likely to result in a rise in CNG and piped cooking gas rates in cities, such as Delhi and Mumbai.  It will also lead to a rise in the cost of generating electricity but consumers may not feel any major pinch as the share of power produced from gas is very low.  Similarly, the cost of producing fertiliser will also go up but as the government subsidises the crop nutrient, an increase in rates is unlikely.  For producers, this will be the first time in six years that they will get a remunerative price.  ONGC had been incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had &amp;quot;inherent limitations&rdquo; as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada, and Russia.  The sources said ONGC had in several communications to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of $5-9 per MMBtu and that for old fields such as Mumbai High and Bassein is about $3.6-3.7.  The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates, but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.  The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter.  The rate at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till it touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period.  Subsequently, it rose to $3.69 in April 2019-September 2019 before being cut in subsequent rounds to $1.79.

The company had reported a profit of Rs 13,680 crore in the September 2021 quarter.  Consolidated operating revenue (net of GST) for the country&rsquo;s most valuable company by market-capitalisation came in at Rs&nbsp;1,91,271 crore, up by&nbsp;62 percent for the quarter from Rs 1,17,860 crore in the year-ago period. Revenues in the previous quarter were Rs 1,67,611 crore.  Consolidated gross revenues for the quarter were higher by 52.2 percent on year at Rs 2,09,823 crore (USD 28.2 billion). On a sequential basis, the growth was 9.5 percent.  &ldquo;I am happy to announce that Reliance has posted best-ever quarterly performance in 3Q FY22 with strong contribution from all our businesses. Both our consumer businesses, Retail and Digital services have recorded highest ever revenues and EBITDA&rdquo;, said, Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, while commenting on the performance for the quarter.  During this quarter, we continued to focus on strategic investments and partnerships across our businesses to drive future growth, he added.  Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter was up 29.9 percent YoY at Rs 33,886 crore and on quarter on quarter it was higher by 11.9 percent.  The company witnessed a YoY growth of 41.2 percent in its cash profit to Rs 30,147 crore.  Business performance  The strong growth was driven by robust performance across businesses especially from refining, telecom, retail and E&amp;amp;amp;P (exploration and production) businesses. The margins in its refining and petchem business witnessed a healthy growth along with the volumes in these businesses. Higher ARPUs (average revenue per user) in telecom and strong rebound in retail demand aided the growth in its telecom and retail business.  O2C Business  The growth in this business was aided by higher crude prices coupled with higher volumes and better realizations which enabled a 56.8 percent YoY growth in its revenues to Rs 1,31,427 crore. Total throughput (including refinery throughput) improved by 8.2 percent on year and 5.3 percent on quarter to 19.7 MMT (million metric tonnes).  The global demand for crude improved by 4.8 mb/d (million barrels/day) compared to the same quarter a year ago to 99.0 mb/d. Compared to previous quarter, this is up by 1.1 mb/d. This was driven by strong consumption demand and opening up of skies which resulted in increased international travel.  The average rate for brent crude during the quarter stood at USD 79.7 /bbl &nbsp;which was up USD 6.3/bbl (billion barrel) QoQ and USD 35.5/bbl YoY.  &ldquo;The recovery in global oil and energy markets supported strong fuel margins and helped our O2C business deliver robust earnings. Our Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment delivered strong growth in EBITDA with volume growth and improved realization&rdquo;, added Ambani.  Polymer demand during the quarter witnessed a reduction of 3% on quarter and 4% on year. It however, continued to be above pre-COVID level. The polymer prices were higher during the quarter with the prices for PVC touching reaching all time high.  The EBITDA for the business witnessed a strong growth of 38.7 percent to Rs 13,530 crore. It achieved an EBITDA margin of 10.3 percent which were lower from 11.6 percent margins achieved during the year ago quarter.  Jio Platforms  The telecom business had another strong quarter and achieved gross revenues of Rs 24,176 crore, a YoY growth of 13.8 percent (adjusted for Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC)). The growth in business was driven by robust addition of 10.2 million net customers during the quarter which took the total customer base for the telecom business to 421 million.  The ARPU (average revenue per user) came in at Rs 151.6 per subscriber per month which was up 5.6 percent from the previous quarter. Total data traffic during the quarter was 23.4 billion GB, a growth 47.8 percent from the same quarter a year ago.  The business achieved an EBITDA of Rs 10,008 crore at a YoY growth of 18 percent while the net profit for the business grew by a healthy 8.9 percent YoY to Rs 3,795 crore.  Retail Business  Reliance retail saw its gross revenues jump by massive 52.5 percent to record an all time high revenues of Rs 57,714 crore driven by the rebound in retail demand. The business received strong traction from highest ever store sales and sustained growth momentum in digital &amp;amp;amp; new commerce. Strong festive sales doubled the revenues in its Consumer Electronics and Apparel &amp;amp;amp; Footwear businesses while double-digit growth sustained in the Grocery business.  &ldquo;Retail business activity has normalized with strong growth in key consumption baskets on the back of festive season and as lockdowns eased across the country. Our digital services business has delivered broad based, sustainable, and profitable growth through improved customer engagement and subscriber mix&rdquo;, said Ambani.  Strong overall performance helped the business achieve an EBITDA of Rs 3,822 crore, a robust hike of 23.8 percent. Its net profit grew by a similar margin of 23.4 percent to Rs 2,259 crore.  The company added 837 new stores during the quarter, thereby increasing its total operational stores to 14,412. This enabled the company to add 8.8 million square feet of operational area which took the total operational area to 40 million square feet.  Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, invested USD 200 million for 25.8 percent stake on a fully diluted basis in Dunzo, India&rsquo;s leading quick commerce player. This acquisition will add onto Reliance Retail&rsquo;s omni-channel capabilities and facilitate last mile deliveries for JioMart&rsquo;s merchant network.  Solar Energy Business  Ambani said that the company is making steady progress towards achieving its vision of Net Carbon Zero by 2035. &ldquo;Our recent partnerships and investments in technology leaders in the solar and green energy space is illustrative of our commitment to partner India and the World in the transition to clean and green energy&rdquo;, he added.  During the quarter, Reliance New Energy Limited (RNEL), a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL signed definitive agreements to acquire 100 percent shareholding in Faradion Limited for an enterprise value of GBP 100 million. Faradion is one of the leading global battery technology companies whose sodium-ion technology provides a leading energy storage and battery solution which is safe, sustainable, provides high energy density and is significantly cost competitive.  RNEL also acquired 25.16 percent of Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy Limited (SWREL) (formerly Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited) through subscription to preferential offer. It will acquire further stake by way of open offer and secondary purchase to take its total stake in the company to 40 percent.  The company intends to enhance its presence in the consumer and hospitality segment for which it acquired 73.37% stake in Mandarin Oriental Hotel New York, for an equity consideration of approximately USD 98.15 million.  The Reliance Industries stock closed flat at Rs 2,477.85, on the National Stock Exchange on January 21. The stock has generated returns of 18 percent in the past one year and gained 7 percent in the past one month."

The figure for the previous quarter stood at Rs 13,680 crore with the company registering consolidated revenues of Rs 1.7 lakh crore. Earnings Estimates Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal expects a robust growth in the company&rsquo;s O2C (oil to chemical) business followed by retail. It forecasts an on-year growth of 61.7 percent in consolidated revenues to Rs 1.91 lakh crore. On a sequential basis, this will be a growth of 13.7 percent. It expects the refinery throughput at 17.2 MMT (million metric tonnes) with the per-tonne EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) improving to $116.6 on improved Singapore GRM and petrochemical margins. &ldquo;Singapore GRM improved further QoQ in Q3FY22, primarily led by improved diesel and ATF cracks (which almost doubled QoQ),&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in a report. SG GRM in diesel improved by $5.8/bbl (billion barrel) on quarter to $10.9/bbl. GRM&rsquo;s pf ATF (aviation turbine fuel) has improved $4.9/bbl QoQ to $10.3/bbl. The improvement was aided by festive season demand in Asia and increased air travel in the western nations, respectively. Naphtha prices increased to $81.7/bbl from $73.6/bbl in Q2FY22, with cracks improving to $3.4/bbl from $1.9/bbl in Q2FY22. An increase in petchem prices (due to power rationing measures in China, which led to shutdowns at some units) aided deltas for PE (polyethyline) and PVC (polyvinyl chloride) by 13 percent and 32 percent respectively on a quarterly basis (-3 percent and 24 percent YoY), while PP (polypropylene) was flat QoQ and down 16 percent YoY. Motilal Oswal expects consolidated EBITDA to grow 39 percent YoY and 15 percent on quarter to Rs 30,000 crore with the EBITDA of O2C business coming in at Rs 15,000 crore, a growth of 73 percent on-year and 21 percent on-quarter. The EBITDA for its telecom business is expected to grow 17 percent YoY and 5 percent QoQ to Rs 9,500 crore, while retails is expected to post another quarter of strong growth with its EBITDA growing 41 percent YoY and 31 percent QoQ to Rs 3,600 crore. The brokerage expects a 16 percent on-year growth in PAT at Rs 15,300 crore, a sequential growth of 8 percent. International brokerage JP Morgan expects strong recovery in refining and E&amp;amp;amp;P (exploration and production) to drive earnings growth. &ldquo;Overall the two key components of the company&rsquo;s refining margin slate, diesel and jet kero have seen cracks improving as transportation has picked up,&rdquo; the brokerage said in its report. Cracks for the two critical products should continue to improve in CY22 as transportation picks up further, the near-term Omicron impact notwithstanding, it said. JP Morgan expects strong growth in retails business while telecom and petchem are expected to remain steady. The company&rsquo;s SG GRMs may improve from $5/bbl in the previous quarter to over $8/bbl in this quarter, it said, estimating the consolidated EBITDA at Rs 28,259 crore with a sequential growth of 9 percent and a YoY growth of 31 percent. Net profit is pegged at Rs 15,033 crore with an on-year growth of 15 percent and a sequential growth of 10 percent. Kotak Institutional Equities also expects strong growth across businesses and forecasts a growth of 55 percent in consolidated revenues at Rs 1.80 lakh crore, a sequential growth of 7.5 percent. It expects an EBITDA of Rs 28,000 crore with a YoY growth of 30 percent and a sequential growth of 7.8 percent. &ldquo;We expect RIL&rsquo;s standalone EBITDA to increase by 15 percent QoQ reflecting (1) improvement in underlying refining and petchem margins and (2) likely higher volumes for both segments,&rdquo; Kotak said in a report. Apart from this, it expects EBITDA for (1) Jio to increase 4 percent QoQ led by higher ARPUs, which will be partly offset by rising costs and (2) for retail to increase by 27 percent QoQ driven by sustained strong rebound in demand during festive season. PAT is expected at Rs 14,820 crore for the quarter at a YoY growth of 12.1 percent and 8.4 percent QoQ. The stock of Reliance Industries closed at Rs 2,477.5, down Rs 44.1 (1.75 percent) from its previous close, on the National Stock Exchange on January 20. The stock is up 21 percent during the past one year and has generated returns of 9 percent during the past one month."
