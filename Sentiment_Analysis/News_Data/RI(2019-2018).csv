Reliance Retail's shareholders have will get one share of its listed parent, Reliance Industries, in exchange for every four shares, according to the scheme of arrangement posted on Reliance Retail's website.  The share-swap values Reliance Retail at about Rs 2.4 lakh crore.  Reliance Retail is an unlisted subsidiary of Reliance Retail Ventures and an indirect subsidiary of oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).  RIL's shares ended at Rs 1,515.95 apiece on the BSE, giving the company a market cap of Rs 9.6 lakh crore.  In August, RIL had said that it may list Reliance Retail on the stock exchanges in the next five years. Reliance Retail clocked net sales of Rs 1.3 lakh crore last year and has built a network of 10,901 stores.  In the scheme of arrangement, Reliance Retail said it had given employees stock options in 2006 and 2007. &amp;quot;On exercise of the RSUs (restricted stock units) by some of the employees, equity shares have been allotted to them.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;The company has been receiving requests from the employees holding equity shares for providing them options for exit and liquidity, including by way of a listing of the equity shares,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;The company does not have any plan for listing of its equity shares on the stock exchanges&amp;quot; and so the share swap scheme.  In the proposed scheme, &amp;quot;equity shareholders of the company other than the holding company viz, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd are being given listed equity shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (the ultimate holding company of the firm) and the corresponding equity share capital held by them in the company is being reduced and cancelled.&amp;quot;  Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd holds 99.95 per cent of Reliance Retail.

The company said pursuant to the December 17 order of the Mumbai-bench of the National Company Law Tribunal, a meeting of the equity shareholders of Reliance Retail Ltd is being convened on January 23 for approving the Scheme of Arrangement.  Reliance Retail is mainly engaged in the organised retail spanning across various consumption baskets primarily catering to Indian consumers.  It has been set up to &amp;quot;run, operate business centres, hypermarkets, departmental stores, supermarkets, shopping malls, specialty stores, shopping outlets, convenience stores, wholesale, cash and carry operations, non-store formats, warehouses, distribution centers, collection centers, depots and showrooms&amp;quot;.

In the second quarter ending September 30, 2019, Reliance Retail reported a 27 per cent growth in revenues to Rs 41,202 crore with strong growth across formats. Operating profit grew 66.8 per cent to Rs 2,322 crore, driven by margins improvement. It has 24.5 million square feet of retail store area under operation.  The valuation of Reliance Retail, which is also the top wholesale supplier to small shopkeepers, is double that of Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which runs India's biggest supermarket chain.

In a counter affidavit, Reliance said it was a &amp;quot;falsehood&amp;quot; to say that the arbitration tribunal had passed an award requiring the company and its partners to pay $3.5 billion to the government.  It said the petition is an abuse of process as &amp;quot;it portrays that a sum of money is due and payable under the final award and purports to compute the money payable on a basis neither found in the arbitration award nor disclosed in the petition.&amp;quot;  The government, it said, has calculated on its own volition the revised figure of its share of profit from oil and gas production allegedly due by extrapolating the purported finds.  The affidavit came in response to the government moving the Delhi High Court seeking to block Reliance selling 20 per cent stake in its oil and chemical business to Saudi Aramco for $15 billion, in view of pending dues of $3.5 billion in Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields.  An international arbitration tribunal issued a partial award in October 2016 in the dispute between the Government of India (GoI), BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Limited (BG) and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) regarding the Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts (PSC).  The tribunal in its 2016 award determined certain issues of principles. Pending determination of all issues before it, appropriately, it did not award any monetary sums. Quantification of amounts, if any, by the tribunal is to be done when all issues have been decided.  Certain parts of the 2016 award were challenged by BG/RIL before an English court wherein it decided some parts of challenge in favour of BG/RIL and directed the arbitration tribunal to reconsider those parts of the 2016 award. The tribunal, having reconsidered, issued another partial award in December 2018 which was in favour of BG/RIL.  While this challenge was pending in the English court, GoI unilaterally calculated certain amounts, based upon its interpretation of the 2016 award, which the government alleges are payable by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), BG and RIL.  Reliance said pursuant to the 2018 award, GoI's claim comes down very significantly -- a fact which the government has not taken cognisance of and approached the Delhi High Court prematurely for enforcement of its claim computed based on its interpretation of the 2016 award.  RIL maintained that except as quantified by the tribunal, no amount can be said to be payable at this stage.  GoI has challenged the 2018 award and the English court is yet to pronounce its judgment.  One of the most significant issues pending before the tribunal is an increase in the Cost Recovery Limit under the PSC. The arbitration tribunal is scheduled to hear BG/RIL's application for increase of PSC Cost Recovery Limit next year.  If the tribunal decides in favour of BG/RIL, then GoI's computation of sums allegedly payable by ONGC, BG and RIL is expected to further come down.  Final amounts payable, if any, by the parties (ONGC 40 per cent, BG 30 per cent and RIL 30 per cent) can only be determined by the arbitration tribunal in the quantification phase of the arbitration which will be scheduled after it has decided on all the issues before it, it said.  ONGC, who was directed by GoI in 2011 not to participate in the arbitration proceedings but be bound by the award, wrote to the stock exchanges in May 2018 that the government's demand is premature.  The 2016 award, in part superseded by the 2018 award, cannot be said to have attained finality and attempts to enforce the 2016 award are premature, RIL said.

ONGC, which had originally discovered the fields, as a government nominee given 40 per cent back-in rights.  Enron during its bankruptcy was taken over by BG Group of UK in 2003. BG Group's interest was subsequently taken over by Shell in 2016.  The 25-year production sharing contracts for the PMT fields expires this week and Reliance and Shell had decided not to seek an extension for Panna-Mukta fields.  &amp;quot;After 25 years of operating the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, the Panna-Mukta and Tapti Joint Venture partners will be handing over the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields back to the Government of India's (GOI) nominee i.e. ONGC on December 21, 2019,&amp;quot; a joint statement issued by Reliance and Shell said.  Reliance and BG Exploration and Production India Ltd (BGEPIL) hold 30 per cent stake each in PMT while the balance 40 per cent is with ONGC.  &amp;quot;The production sharing contracts (PSC) for the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, which were executed by the PMT JV with the Government of India in 1994, will expire on December 21, 2019,&amp;quot; it said.  The Tapti fields had ceased production earlier in 2016 and the Tapti process platform facilities were handed over to ONGC (GOI nominee) in 2016.  Decommissioning and site restoration of residual Tapti facilities, including five unmanned platforms and in-field pipelines, are currently being carried out by the PMT JV under India's first offshore decommissioning and site restoration project.  The Tapti decommissioning and other commercial activities would continue in BGEPIL even after Panna-Mukta handover, as per the statement.  The Panna-Mukta fields, off the Mumbai coast, produced 211 million barrels of oil and 1.25 Trillion cubic feet of natural gas since December 1994. In 2019, the average monthly production from the fields was around 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 140 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day.  Speaking on the development, Trivikram Arun, Managing Director, BGEPIL said, &amp;quot;The PMT JV is a great example of a successful partnership between India's largest national oil company (ONGC), India's largest private company (Reliance) and an international oil company (Shell).&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Our teams have worked relentlessly to ensure a safe handover of the producing fields from the PMT JV to ONGC at the end of the term,&amp;quot; he said.

This follows the initial heads of agreement signed in August this year,&amp;quot; a statement said.  The venture is expected to be formed during the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.  RIL currently has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 30-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These will be taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and grown in future.  RIL will hold 51 per cent in the new joint venture company while BP will have the remaining 49 per cent. This will assume ownership of RIL's existing Indian fuel retail network and access its aviation fuel business.  In August, RIL had said BP will pay about Rs 7,000 crore for acquiring a 49 per cent stake in its existing petrol pumps and aviation turbine fuel network.  This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought 30 per cent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India.  The country currently has 66,408 petrol pumps, with public sector retailers owning 59,831. PSU retailers have plans to double this network and have already starting appointing dealers.  Russia's Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, formerly Essar Oil, has 5,453 petrol pumps and has plans to scale them up to more than 7,000 in two-three years.  Royal Dutch Shell has 167 outlets and is slated to add 150-200 more petrol pumps.  BP had in 2016 received a licence from the government to set up 3,500 petrol pumps in India but it didn't move on that authorisation.  French energy giant Total SA too is keen on entering the Indian retail market and has tied up with Adani Group for the same.  &amp;quot;The new venture, further development of RIL and BP's longstanding partnership, will include an India-wide fuels retail service station network and aviation fuel marketing business. Building from RIL's existing businesses, the partners expect the venture to co-create a world-class fuels partnership to grow rapidly and help meet India's fast-growing demands for energy and mobility,&amp;quot; the statement issued on Monday said.  The partnership, it said, will expand the fuel and ATF network to up to 5,500 petrol pumps and 45 aviation fuel stations over the next five years.  &amp;quot;The retail network will operate under the Jio-BP brand, signalling a new paradigm shift in fuels marketing and mobility solutions. It brings together Reliance's extensive access and connection to consumers through its Jio digital platform and BP's deep experience in fuel retailing around the world. The joint venture will seek to offer Indian consumers high-quality differentiated fuels, convenience and services,&amp;quot; the statement said.  BP's Castrol lubricants will also be available across the venture's network.  The agreement was signed in Mumbai by Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of RIL and Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive of BP.  Ambani said: &amp;quot;I am delighted that BP and Reliance are further building on their strong partnership. BP and Reliance are combining their knowledge, expertise and experience to provide Indian consumers world-class products and services. We believe that together we will bring solutions that will benefit the fast-growing Indian market.&amp;quot;  Bob Dudley said: &amp;quot;India is one of the world's most important energy markets &ndash; its transport and aviation sectors are growing and evolving rapidly.

Public and private sector banks faced diverse fortunes in 2019. As many as 14 of 22 public sector banks reported cumulative losses of Rs 74,253 crore. In contrast, just two private sector banks posted losses (IDFC First Bank, at Rs 1,907.9 crore; and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, at Rs 894.1 crore). The total profit of 24 of private sector banks (including foreign banks and cooperative banks) was Rs 60,747 crore, a 6.16 percent increase over 2017-18.  Fortune India said the oil and gas sector (with eight companies) accounted for 22.3 percent of the total revenue of the 500 companies, followed by banking with 15.88 percent of the total.

We have selected Reliance Industries&nbsp;from the pack. After hitting the fresh all-time high, stock has formed a base and appearing to be ready for fresh up move again. Hence, we would recommend the delta appreciating based &ldquo;Bull Call Spread&rdquo; in the counter.  As we have appropriate time left for the expiry, it will be prudent to go for Delta Based strategy to capture the up move.  Option Chain Analysis  The initial signal of an up move has been witnessed in the option chain, as Call option of 1,580 strike price has lost 236,000 contracts in open interest which suggest that bears are on the back foot. On the other hand, bulls have shown confidence and fresh writing of 71,500 contracts has been witnessed in 1580 strike price Put option.  The last concern for the bulls is now at 1,600 level, where maximum outstanding Open Interest (OI) is placed on the Call side and traders can expect sharp move in the counter once the level is taken out on higher side.  Stock seems to be ready for the rally till 1,640 level, which is a probable target as per option chain. 1,640 CE holds approximately 9 lakh contracts on short side and likely to be an appropriate profit booking point for the bulls.  Technical and Market Structure  The overall technical structure is quite bullish after hitting fresh all-time high and the stock has consolidated at near its 20-Day Moving average. Now, the sign of revival is appearing again and stock is falling in the category of reversal after retracement.  After the convergence, the short term moving averages are again opening up and moving upwards. RSI is bouncing back from the important support levels and trading in a bullish zone.  Apart from this, 38.2 percent retracement move is also respected in the counter as per Fibonacci theory. Traders can expect the fresh all-time highs in the counter in days to come and project the immediate target of Rs 1,640.

The hike will boost revenue over the next four quarters as the revamped plans will restrict down-trading-led revenue leakage.  ",,"Business, Market news, Morgan Stanley, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance-industries-roce-could-rise-to-112-years-morgan-stanley_13260721.html,"Reliance Industries' after-tax return on capital employed is likely to rise to 11 per cent in two years from the current 7-8 per cent as margins rise on the back of an increase in telecom tariffs, Morgan Stanley said on December 10. &amp;quot;RIL strong stock outperformance has once again led investors to ask about what is next,&amp;quot; it said in a research report.  Over the past decade, RIL's post-tax ROCE (return on capital employed) has been range-bound around 7-8 per cent. &amp;quot;We think this trend is set to be reversed as the telecom tariff increase should raise returns on $50 billion of investments (50 per cent of the last capital expenditure cycle).&amp;quot;  Last week, top-three mobile operators Bharti Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea increased prepaid tariffs by 14-33 per cent.  &amp;quot;We see ROCE rising to 11 per cent in two years as consumer portfolio returns inch closer to energy ROCE of around 14 per cent,&amp;quot; it said adding although overall returns are still below levels since 2004, an uplift in the chemical cycle from current troughs should boost ROCE higher.  Reliance Jio, the telecom arm of RIL, last week raised tariff by up to 39 per cent following hikes effected by other service providers. The hike will boost revenue over the next four quarters as the revamped plans will restrict down-trading-led revenue leakage.  Edelweiss in a separate report said while the industry's average revenue per user (ARPU) has plunged 33 per cent over the past four years, voice usage per customer has jumped 84 per cent and data usage by 47-times providing enough value to customers to justify the tariff hike.  &amp;quot;We expect industry ARPUs to improve over Q4FY20-Q3FY21 led by users optimising spends by advancing recharges as well as consolidating SIMs,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Moreover, users are likely to delay recharges as well as down-trades, especially in the voice segment.&amp;quot;  However, the new tariff plans are still affordable and the hikes are expected to drive 35 per cent ARPU improvement in four quarters for Jio, it said. &amp;quot;With Reliance Jio plans being 20 per cent cheaper than rivals, we expect the company's robust subscriber addition pace to sustain. Hence, we revise up Jio's FY21 subscriber estimate 17 per cent to 471 million.&amp;quot;  Centrum said Jio has seen the highest increase in tariffs in the 56-84 days' validity plans which have risen by 33-35 per cent, while the lowest increase was seen in the 2GB/day plans for 28 days (12.2 per cent).  &amp;quot;Given that there is some portion of subscribers who may down trade to lower-priced plans and some subscribers may have taken longer prepaid plans in advance, we estimate an 8 per cent increment in ARPU for FY21 and a further 19 per cent in FY22E for Jio,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Resultant, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) for Jio sees an upgrade of 16/20 per cent from previous estimates.&amp;quot;  Jio plans, it said, remain the most attractive on the street. &amp;quot;Despite the material uptick in the tariff plans, Jio's plans across price points remain the cheapest on the street, with a discount of 8-20 per cent vs Airtel/ Voda-Idea plans.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;With the superior data speeds and network coverage for Jio, we believe its dominant position in terms of market share growth and data usage will sustain comfortably over the next 18-24 months post this change,&amp;quot; it said.  Morgan Stanley said RIL's chemical Ebitda will decline a 20 per cent quarter-on-quarter in October-December, leading to overall earnings to remain muted despite better refining margin.  However, the trough is unlikely to be sustained as supply rationalisation and normalisation in inventory should help margins, it said.

The signing of the agreement in Abu Dhabi was witnessed by UAE Minister and ADNOC Group CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber and RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh D Ambani.  The agreement was signed by Abdulaziz Alhajri, Executive Director of ADNOC's Downstream Directorate, and Nikhil R Meswani, RIL Executive Director.  Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used primarily for the production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), which is used mainly in the polymerization manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  PVC is commonly used in pipes, ?ttings, pro?les, tubes, windows, doors, sidings, wire, cable, ?lm, sheet, and ?ooring.  The vinyls industries include construction and infrastructure, agriculture, electrical products and healthcare. EDC is also used as an intermediate in the manufacture of chlorinated solvents and ethyleneamines, and as a solvent in the textile, metal cleaning, and adhesive industries.  The US is the largest producer and consumer of EDC in the world, accounting for approximately 30 per cent of global capacity, production, and consumption in 2018. The US is also the largest EDC exporter, representing about 43 per cent of global exports, as a result of advantaged production economics and healthy demand for caustic soda.  The Indian subcontinent is expected to be the fastest-growing region for EDC demand, with a projected increase of about 17 per cent per year.  &amp;quot;ADNOC would supply ethylene to the potential joint venture and provide access to world-class infrastructure at Ruwais, while RIL will deliver operational expertise and entry to the large and growing Indian vinyls market, in which it is a key participant,&amp;quot; the statement said.  Meswani said: &amp;quot;This is a significant step towards Reliance's commitment to pursue backward integration and will pave the way for enhancing PVC capacity in India to cater to the fast growing domestic market. This co-operation ideally combines advantaged feedstock and energy from the UAE with Reliance's execution capabilities and the growing Indian market.&amp;quot;  Alhajri said: &amp;quot;The agreement with Reliance Industries Limited is a product of our strong relationship, spanning over two decades, and a testament to ADNOC's continued ability to cultivate smart and mutually beneficial international partnerships. We look forward to working closely with RIL to identify opportunities to capitalize on the strengths of the Ruwais ecosystem, while delivering a compelling new commercial platform for satisfying the large Indian PVC market, as well as demand for other fast-growing segments in the region.

Sharing further details on where this opportunity lies, he said, &ldquo; For the entire B group and the smallcap (excluding the A group), the marketcap at this point of time is Rs 9.2 lakh crore and the marketcap of Reliance Industries &nbsp;(RIL) alone is Rs 9.9 lakh crore. So it clearly shows that we have a problem somewhere. Markets are totally disconnected from realities.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Therefore, it is impossible to believe that 8,000-9,000 or 5,000 companies, all doing business in the same country total up to a marketcap of Rs 9.2 lakh crore versus one company on one side, which is Rs 9.9 lakh crore. So it shows that there is phenomenal opportunity in the market,&amp;quot; he said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.  According to him, the big theme over the next two years is going to be public sector enterprises. PSUs have been beaten down to nothing but it is matter of time before they will get re-rated. There is immense value there, he said.  When asked about the auto space, he said, &ldquo;The feedback that I get from the channels is that the excess inventory has been pushed out, it has come down substantially but one cannot say that demand is going to come up and things are going to be gung-ho from next month onwards.&amp;quot; It is possible that there are early green-shoots but would still prefer to wait a month or two or maybe a quarter to see auto stabilising, he added.  &amp;quot;The early signs are there, so for people who want to take a risk, be bold and catch it early, maybe they could take a call. I won&rsquo;t be surprised if the numbers are down next month again,&rdquo; said Dutt.  According to him, one can find opportunities across the sectors &ndash; there are good quality companies in consumption, in pharmaceuticals, in infrastructure construction, banking and financial services.  On telecom space, he said, &ldquo;Reliance standalone is an excellent company, excellent investment but till one doesn&rsquo;t get clarity on how to take a telecom exposure on Reliance, I think the only option left is Bharti Airtel right now or for some real brave people there is Vodafone and&nbsp;I am one of those.&amp;quot;  On the financial side, he is not upbeat on Yes Bank, he said.  When asked about the possibility of the goods and services tax (GST) rates going up, Dutt said, &ldquo;The fact is that when the corporate tax rates went down, we rallied for two days and we forgot about it. We never realised that that was the seminal change that happened in Indian macro and corporate history but the market forgot about it and we moved on. Yes, economy has a problem, we do have a problem, GST rate tinkering happens, go up 2 percent here, 3 percent there but is that going to change consumption anywhere? It is not. It is going to change for about a month or two or three months, we will absorb it and move on. I am not going re-balance my portfolio based on GST rates but would look at much deeper fundamentals and other important issues that are going to reflect on my portfolio for the next two-ten years.&rdquo;  &ldquo;My view is going to change when I see some fundamental shifts happening. If the GST rates goes up 2 percent on something, goes down on something, it is not going to impact me in my portfolio as such. It will have a short-term impact,&amp;quot; he said, adding that fundamentally, if we have a problem in the economy, we need to sort that out.  &amp;quot;More than the economy, we have a problem in the financial system today. The single-most problem that we are all living with is trust issue. There is no trust in the financial system. Till that is not restored, no amount of work can be done,&rdquo; he further mentioned.

The objective is to make the digital platform holding company along with Reliance Jio (RJio) debt free that will pave the way for attracting strategic investors and financial investors in the digital business at a premium valuation.  What all is included?  The group has created a very strong digital ecosystem through RJio, which has become the second-largest single country service provider with more than 355 million subscribers. The new subsidiary would include Reliance Jio and its platforms viz: MyJio, JioTV, JioCinema, JioNews and JioSaavan and all other emerging digital platforms in the areas of education, health etc.  The objective  After the completion of RJio&rsquo;s major capital expenditure, the group demerged its tower and fibre passive infrastructure assets to make RJio asset light. However, RJio still has a balance sheet of Rs 2,37,000 crore post the demerger.  The primary objective of creating the aforesaid WOS is to make RJio debt free through the rights issue of optionally convertible preference shares (OCPS) aggregating up to Rs 1,08,000 crore to the WOS. This OCPS issuance by RJio to WOS is towards payment for transfer of identified liabilities of this amount to RIL (100&nbsp;percent owner of WOS).  As part of this arrangement, the WOS will also take over RIL&rsquo;s ownership of Rs 65,000 crore equity in RJIL. Effectively, WOS would hold an interest amounting to Rs 1,73,000 crore in RJIL. Post this, RJIL would become virtually debt-free by the end of FY20 , with the exception of spectrum related liabilities.  Benefits?  The structure need not involve a&nbsp;complete&nbsp;cash outgo at this point in time. However, it can be expected to be in alignment with the redemption profile of the identified liabilities being transferred to RIL.  The most important objective of undertaking this structuring is to bring all the digital businesses under one umbrella.  All digital initiatives of cutting-edge technologies, collaborations&nbsp;and partnerships will happen on this platform.  Through the reorganisation of the capital structure, the equity base of this digital platform gets expanded from Rs 65,000 crore to Rs 1,73,000 crore, entirely held by RIL through its WOS.&nbsp;This will create capacity to onboard strategic / financial investors at a future date.  The digital platform will be debt free.  The coming together of all the digital businesses will make this company the first port of call for any overseas entity looking to harness Indian digital growth opportunities.  Hence, in future getting a financial and/or strategic investor for the digital business at a very good valuation is highly probable.

The board of RIL October 25 approved&nbsp;the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary&nbsp;for its digital&nbsp;businesses and the infusion of&nbsp;Rs 1.08 lakh crore in it.  The deal&nbsp;will make&nbsp;RJIL a net-debt free company by March 31, 2020.  This is because the board of RJIL approved a&nbsp;scheme of arrangement between the company and certain classes of its creditors, including debenture holders, that will transfer identified liabilities of up to Rs 1.08 lakh crore to RIL.  Consequently, the newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary will subscribe&nbsp;to a rights issue of Optionally Convertible Preference Shares (OCPS) aggregating up to the same amount - Rs 1.08 lakh crore.  After the transaction, RJIL will become virtually net debt-free company by the end of this fiscal. Only&nbsp;the spectrum-related liabilities will remain.  The latest move comes after RJIL's core digital connectivity platform, tower and fiber passive infrastructure assets of approximately Rs 1.25 lakh crore were demerged in March 2019, to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs).  Following this demerger, RJIL became asset-light having a balance sheet size of Rs 2.37&nbsp;lakh&nbsp;crore.  The twin restructuring exercise now gives the 4G-based telecom operator, which has&nbsp;35.5 crore subscribers, enough room to expand and possibly boost its 5G ambitions.  And also, this helps it open gates to more investors. Already, after the March move, the company got an investor in the form of&nbsp;Brookfield Asset Management, which agreed to acquire the tower business through an infusion of Rs 25,215 crore.  More such announcements can now be expected.  The digital push, now with the newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, will add teeth to RJIL's offering.

Even as some concerns were raised on the company's core business - petchem and refinery - brokerages, broadly, are positive on the stock for the long term horizon.  On October 18, RIL reported the highest-ever quarterly consolidated profit of Rs 11,262 crore in Q2FY20, beating Street expectations.  &amp;quot;The company has reported a record net profit for the quarter. These excellent results reflect the benefits of our integrated Oil to Chemicals (O2C) value chain and the rapid scale-up of our consumer businesses,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of the company, said.  After the Q2 numbers were released, global financial firm HSBC maintained a buy recommendation on the stock, raising the target price to Rs 1,565 from Rs 1,475.  HSBC said RIL's balance sheet deleveraging should accelerate in the coming quarters even as the earnings outlook of the company remains robust.  Nomura, too, maintained a buy recommendation on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 1,785 from Rs 1,575.  Nomura has raised its earnings estimates on RIL by 7-12 percent, citing that the outperformance of the company may sustain.  UBS also has a buy call on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,500, while Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating, with a target price of Rs 1,469, on the stock.  Citi has a buy recommendation on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,500.  &amp;quot;IMO impact on gross refining margins, progress on 4 ongoing transactions, gasification ramp-up, FTTH traction and IUC developments are the keys for the next two quarters,&amp;quot; said Citi in a note.  Macquarie has an outperform call with a target price of Rs 1,380, but Jefferies has an underperform view on RIL.  However, Jefferies has raised the target price to Rs 1,060 from Rs 1,025 earlier.  Credit Suisse (CS) has maintained a neutral call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,210 and said refining margin remained strong and was partly offset by weakness in petrochemical. The brokerage has highlighted a sharp reduction in Jio's capex which was down 40 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).    Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services has maintained a buy recommendation with a target price of Rs 1,630.  &amp;quot;We revise the valuation multiple for the core segment of refining and petchem to 8.5 times (from 7.5 times earlier) FY21E EV/EBITDA to factor in the enhanced delayed coker capacity, the widening of crude blend window for maximizing distillate yields prior to IMO and the revival in petchem margins for the company under its flexible feedstock utilisation,&amp;quot; said Motilal Oswal.  The domestic brokerage has raised the target price of Reliance Jio to Rs 280 from Rs 250.  Brokerage firm Antique Stock Broking, too, has retained a buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,555.  &amp;quot;We retain our buy rating on RIL, albeit with a revised target price of 1,555, as we roll earnings forward and introduce FY22E. In our view, the conclusion of large investment and eventual reduction of debt would add to positive sentiment,&amp;quot; said Antique Stock Broking.  &amp;quot;Expected infusion of capital by Saudi Aramco and BP, would only expedite reduction of debt. In addition, consumers facing business continue to grow in scale and profitability, thereby de-risking the earnings mix,&amp;quot; Antique Stock Broking added.  Emkay Global Financial Services has maintained a hold recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,540.  &amp;quot;We raise our refining EV/EBITDA multiple valuing oil-to-chemicals at $70 billion EV (against $75 billion for Aramco deal). We also reduce FY20/21E Jio capex to Rs 30,000-25,000 crore against Rs 40,000-35,000 crore earlier, though our overall capex and debt levels are largely the same,&amp;quot; said Emkay Global.  SBICAP Securities has a buy recommendation on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,670.  &amp;quot;We initiate coverage with a buy rating as we expect the strong growth momentum in telecom and retail business to continue,&amp;quot; said SBICAP Securities.  &amp;quot;Our target price implies an FY21E P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of 13.7 times (3 year average: 13.3 times), FY21E P/B (price-to-book&nbsp;ratio) of 1.9 times (3 year average: 1.5 times) and FY21E EV/EBITDA of 9.8 times (3 year average: 10.1 times),&amp;quot; said SBICAP Securities.  &amp;quot;We take comfort from the company&lsquo;s effort to address balance sheet concerns by expediting deleveraging exercise (via InvIT structure for its tower and fibre InvIT and potential stake sale in refining and petchem business to Saudi Aramco), and is targeting to become a zero net debt company by the end of FY21,&amp;quot; SBICAP Securities added.  Axis Capital, too, came out with a similar view on Reliance Industries after the company revealed its September quarter numbers. The brokerage has a 'buy' recommendation with a target price of Rs 1,650.  &amp;quot;A combination of diminishing headwinds and rising tailwinds shall drive the growth of Reliance Industries. We expect the stock to double in 4 years to Rs 2,790. Our 1-year SOTP-based target price stands at Rs 1,650,&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  As of October 18, the stock is up 26 percent on the BSE in Calendar 2019, in comparison to a 9 percent rise in the benchmark Sensex.

This was backed by renewed FII inflow along with consistent DIIs money, government's initiative towards strategic disinvestments -- especially after stellar response to IRCTC, -- stable earnings and favourable global cues including the Brexit deal.  With&nbsp;a rally in two consecutive weeks, benchmark indices recouped all its losses seen in the week ended October 4. The BSE Sensex ended at 39,298.38 and the Nifty50 at 11,661.90.  Corporate Q2 earnings are expected to be dull and may disappoint in some cases. Liquidity issues along with consumer spending slowdown could led to not so good Q2 growth numbers.  &amp;quot;We may see some consolidation in Nifty after the recent surge while movement on the specific stocks would continue. In the absence of any major event, global cues and earnings will continue to dictate the market trend,&amp;quot; said Ajit Mishra Vice President, Research, Religare Broking.  In Q2FY20, although corporates would have a lower base of profits, lower operating leverage in Q2FY20 would mean that margins may not show commensurate rise. A lot of these negative expectations are already in the price.  Corporate tax cuts will certainly lead to one-time adjustments and not upgrades.  However, at an aggregate level, revenues are expected to be slower on a YoY basis. But, this will not act as a deterrent suppressing the mood of Mr. Market. Markets should begin pricing in the revival of the economy given the stupendous government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) initiatives in place, said Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities.  Here is a look at the top 10 companies which declared September quarter results last week:  Reliance Industries Q2 profit beats estimates, Jio registers healthy growth  RIL, the country's most valued company by market capitalisation, reported highest every quarterly consolidated profit in September quarter, driven by refining, telecom and retail segments. Higher other income and lower tax cost also boost the bottom line.  Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries registered an 18.34 percent year-on-year growth in second-quarter consolidated profit to Rs 11,262 crore. The sequential increase was 11.46 percent.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said, &amp;quot;The company has reported record net profit for the quarter. These excellent results reflect the benefits of our integrated Oil to Chemicals (O2C) value chain and the rapid scale-up of our Consumer businesses. During this quarter, our O2C businesses gained from favourable fuel margins environment, feedstock sourcing flexibility and higher petrochemicals volumes.&amp;quot;  Consolidated revenue during the quarter increased 3.63 percent to Rs 1,48,526 crore compared to the year-ago period, but the same declined 5.4 percent on a sequential basis. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 3.9 percent sequentially to Rs 22,152 crore and margin expanded by 130bps QoQ to 14.91 percent in the quarter ended September 2019.  Jio registered a healthy 11.1 percent sequential growth in the second-quarter profit at Rs 990 crore on revenue of Rs 12,354 crore that increased by 5.8 percent QoQ, boosted by Diwali plan.  HDFC Bank: Q2 profit jumps 27&nbsp;percent&nbsp;to Rs 6,345 crore  Private sector lender HDFC Bank, on October 19 reported a healthy 26.75 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in profit for the quarter that ended on September 2019 with stable asset quality.  Profit after tax for the quarter increased to Rs 6,345 crore against Rs 5,005.73 crore earned in the same period last year. The growth was driven by average asset growth of 15 percent and a core net interest margin for the quarter of 4.2 percent.  Net interest income during the quarter grew by 14.89 percent to Rs 13,515.04 crore YoY with loan growth at 19.5 percent as compared to same period last year. The bank said domestic advances grew by 20.7 percent with retail loans growth of 14.7 percent and wholesale at 27.9 percent YoY.  Hindustan Unilever meets Street expectations in Q2FY20; net profit jumps 21 percent  FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on October 14 reported a 21 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in its net profit at Rs 1,848 crore for July-September quarter of the financial year 2019-20 on the back of better volume growth. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came at Rs 2,443 crore, up 21 percent (16 percent on comparable basis after adjusting for accounting impact of Ind AS 116).  The domestic consumer segment grew by 7 percent with underlying Volume growth at 5 percent. Reported EBITDA improvement is 310 bps (200 bps on a comparable basis after adjusting for accounting impact of Ind AS 116 on leases), the company claimed.  &amp;quot;Amidst a challenging market environment, HUL has delivered another quarter of resilient performance and sustained margin improvement. Our focus on consumer value, excellence in execution and market development continues to serve us well,&amp;quot; said Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director of the company.  Zee Entertainment Q2 profit rises 7 percent  Zee Entertainment Enterprises, on October 17, reported a 6.9 percent year-on-year growth (YoY) in September quarter profit at Rs 413.2 crore, impacted by slow revenue growth and weak operating margin. Profit for the quarter that ended on September last year stood at Rs 386.7 crore.  Revenue during the quarter grew by 7.4 percent to Rs 2,122 crore compared to same period last year due to lower-than-expected growth in advertising revenue (up 1.2 percent YoY) and subscription revenue (up 19 percent YoY). Advertising revenue growth was expected at 2-4 percent and subscription revenue growth at 25-26 percent for the quarter, according to a poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.  Wipro Q2 profit rises 7&nbsp;percent QoQ  Software services provider Wipro reported a 7 percent sequential growth in second quarter profit at Rs 2,552.7 crore while the guidance for Q3 was ahead of analyst estimates. Profit in the quarter ended June 2019 stood at Rs 2,387.6 crore.

Also read:&nbsp;RIL Q2 profit beats estimates; 10 key takeaways from quarterly result  RIL&rsquo;s thrust towards consumer facing businesses was evident in yet another stellar performance by its retail division. Reliance Retail remains among the biggest and fastest growing retail players in the world.      Key Positives  - Despite last year&rsquo;s high base, Reliance Retail reported a 27 percent growth YoY (year-on-year) in its top-line, led by new stores and healthy same-store sales. Retail revenue for Q2 FY20 stood at Rs 41,202 crore, an all-time quarterly high. Operational efficiencies led to margins improving noticeably YoY as well.  Also read | RIL Q2 result: Consumer business now contributes one-third of quarterly EBITDA, says CFO  -Jio saw a strong 33.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its net revenue which came in at Rs12,354 crore. The growth came on the back of net addition of 24 million subscribers in the quarter. Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base stood at 355.2 million.  Also read |&nbsp;Reliance Jio earnings: Q2 net profit rises 45.4% to Rs 990 crore  -Jio continues to positively surprise in terms of its operating margin. Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)margin expanded by 314.8 bps in the quarter gone by. The management highlighted that it was driven by operational efficiencies.  Key Negatives  -Weakness in global crude prices was reflected in lower realization for the refining segment. While the GRM (gross refining margin) was up sequentially, they remained below expectations at $9.4 per barrel. Lower differential between light and heavy crude and higher costs for heavy crude led to around a 7 percent year-on-year decline in EBIT (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization). Issues in Iran and Venezuela also hit refining margins to certain extent.    -The petchem segment saw a sharp growth in volumes. However, with weakness in prices of petrochemical products there was a 12 percent YoY dip in segment revenue. &nbsp;Demand revival in both polymer and polyester in the domestic market contributed to the volume growth. Addition of new capacity resulted in inventory overhang. Together with subdued global demand, this resulted in weak margins for most petchem products.  - While Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of growth moderated primarily due to base effects and increased competition. Strong competition and offers by Jio led to an ARPU decline of 8.9 percent on YoY basis. ARPU came in at Rs120 per month.    Outlook  The results were broadly in line with our expectations. The weakness in the traditional businesses was in line with global trends. However, we take a cue from the CFO's comments about strength in product demand and improving volumes which should aid performance in the current quarter. It is important to remember that major capex in the businesses is now at an end and benefits should accordingly start flowing in.  We believe Jio would continue to do well, going forward, on the back of its strategy of offering services at a reasonable price. Its focus on deeper and wider market penetration has made it the largest telecom operator in India in terms of subscriber base, within a very short time.  There are two factors which could aid earnings momentum for the telecom business. The first is the launch of JioGigaFiber services during the quarter, which is getting good traction from its customers. Secondly, the company&rsquo;s decision to start charging its customers 6 paisa per minute on the outgoing calls made to other networks to recover the Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC) which the company pays to other network providers. This would improve operating margins, at least for the next quarter.  For the retail business, going forward, revenue growth would be driven by aggressive brick-and-mortar store expansion, integration of online and offline retailing, measures to grow the customer loyalty base and exclusive agreements with more foreign lifestyle brands.  In a bid to improve margins, we expect greater emphasis will be laid on promoting private labels across segments, improving the product mix, undertaking store productivity initiatives to boost like-to-like sales and leveraging benefits of scale.  However, weak consumer demand, particularly in rural India, would be a challenge in the near future and will be something investors need to watch out for.

The government had last month slashed the corporate tax by ten percentage points, under which the effective outgo for companies will come down to 25.17 per cent.

The sequential increase was 11.46 percent.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said,&amp;quot; The Company has reported record net profit for the quarter. These excellent results reflect the benefits of our integrated Oil to Chemicals (O2C) value chain and the rapid scale-up of our Consumer businesses.

Increase in revenue YoY is primarily on account of robust growth in retail &amp;amp;amp; digital services businesses which grew by 27 percent and 43 percent, respectively. This was partially offset by decrease in refining and petrochemicals segment revenue with 17.7 percent fall in Brent crude price.  Operating Income  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 3.9 percent sequentially to Rs 22,152 crore and margin expanded by 130bps QoQ to 14.91 percent in the quarter ended September 2019.

The same degrew by 1.6 percent year-on-year due to lower crude prices and EBIT decreased by 6.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,957 crore mainly due to marginally lower GRM and narrow light-heavy crude differentials.  Petrochemical Segment  Petrochemical segment revenue grew by 2.5 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 38,538 crore and at an operating level, the EBIT increased 1.3 percent but margin contracted 30 bps QoQ in September quarter.  The segment de-grew year-on-year by 11.9 percent reflecting fall in prices of petrochemical products, the company said.

Reliance Jio  Jio registered a healthy 11.1 percent sequential growth in the second-quarter profit at Rs 990 crore on revenue of Rs 12,354 crore that increased by 5.8 percent QoQ, boosted by Diwali plan.

These excellent results reflect the benefits of our integrated Oil to Chemicals (O2C) value chain and the rapid scale-up of our consumer businesses,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  During this quarter, O2C businesses gained from favourable fuel margins environment, feedstock sourcing flexibility and higher petrochemicals volumes, he added.  Gross refining margin came in at $9.4 a barrel for the quarter, against $8.1 a barrel in June quarter. It was lower than a CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts which was pegged at $9.5 a barrel.  &amp;quot;Refining margins improved QoQ on the back of strengthening light and middle distillate and FO cracks,&amp;quot; company said. The benchmark Singapore Complex Margin averaged $6.5 a barrel in Q2FY20 as compared to $3.5 a barrel in Q1FY20 and $6.1 a barrel in Q2FY19.  The stock gained 1.37 percent to end at a record closing high of Rs 1,415.30 on Friday, ahead of September quarter results and crossed market capitalisation of Rs 9 lakh crore intraday, becoming the most valued listed company in India. It rallied 6 percent during the quarter ended September 2019 while it surged 26 percent year-to-date.  At the operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 3.9 percent sequentially to Rs 22,152 crore and margin expanded 130 basis points (bps) QoQ to 14.91 percent in the quarter ended September 2019.  Overall numbers were a mixed bag. Profit was estimated at Rs 10,803 crore on revenue of Rs 1.55 lakh crore and EBITDA of Rs 22,269 crore and margin at 14.3 percent for the quarter, according to a poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.  On the segment front, refining business, which contributed 65 percent of total operating revenue, registered a 4.4 percent sequential degrowth at Rs 97,229 crore during the quarter, but EBIT grew 10 percent and margin increased by 70 bps QoQ.  Petrochemical segment revenue grew 2.5 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 38,538 crore and at an operating level, the EBIT increased 1.3 percent but margin contracted 30 bps QoQ in September quarter.  Reliance Jio has become India's largest mobility services provider with the highest market share in terms of 4G subscriber base and 4G data traffic in India, Mukesh Ambani said.  &amp;quot;Jio is still adding more than 1 crore new customers every month and is now geared to kick-start other growth engines,&amp;quot; he added.  Jio registered a healthy 11.1 percent sequential growth in second quarter profit at Rs 990 crore on revenue of Rs 12,354 crore that increased by 5.8 percent QoQ, boosted by Diwali plan.  Its total subscriber base increased by 7.2 percent QoQ to 355.2 million at the end of September quarter after adding 24 million users during the quarter (against 24.5 million addition in Q1FY20).  &amp;quot;JioPhone Diwali 2019 plan (marketed by Reliance Retail) offering the device at Rs 699 (without an exchange of old device) has witnessed a strong response in first few weeks,&amp;quot; Reliance said in its BSE filing.  Jio's EBITDA grew by 10.2 percent sequentially to Rs 5,166 crore and margin increased 170 bps to 41.8 percent in quarter ended September 2019. Average revenue per user for the quarter stood at Rs 120 against Rs 122 in June quarter.  Ambani said Reliance Retail delivered robust performance with record quarterly revenues and EBITDA in Q2.  Company's organised retail segment reported a 7.87 percent QoQ growth (up 27 percent YoY) in revenue at Rs 41,202 crore and 13.32 percent increase QoQ (up 67 percent YoY) in EBITDA at Rs 2,322 crore for the quarter. Its EBIT grew by 14.5 percent QoQ and margin expanded 29 bps.  Reliance Retail added 337 stores in Q2, taking total store count now to 10,901 at the end of September quarter.  The outstanding debt at the end of September 2019 was Rs 291,982 crore compared to Rs 287,505 crore as of March 2019 while cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 134,746 crore against Rs 133,027 crore during the same period.

The brokerage feels consolidated EBITDA will be further boosted by higher contribution from Jio amid rising subscriber base and steady ARPUs and retail segment amid sustained, albeit a tad slower growth in revenues.  HDFC Securities also expects RIL's EBITDA to increase due to higher refining EBITDA.  Petchem volumes should rise by 9.5 percent due to shutdowns in Q1 while unit EBITDA is expected to fall 10 percent owing to lower polymer spreads, the brokerage said, adding refinery crude throughput is likely to be 8.2 mmt against 7.5 mmt in Q1FY20.  Brokerages expect the Reliance Jio subscriber growth to be robust with the significant addition of users in Q2.

In a report, the brokerage said the key drivers necessary for Reliance to breach $200 billion market cap in 24 months from current $122 billion market cap are new commerce initiative of empowering Kiranas in unorganised retail market by offering MPoS (mobile point-of-sale), entry into SME enterprise space with Microsoft, Jio's fiber broadband business and digital initiatives like advertising.  &amp;quot;We think the market is giving little credit to these initiatives given limited visibility,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;We expect near-term momentum to be strong.&amp;quot;  Its bull case scenario that takes m-cap to $200 billion assumed Jio's per mobile phone user revenue increasing to Rs 177 in FY22 from Rs 151, 10 million Kirana's paying the company Rs 750 a month for installing M-PoS, and broadband users reaching 12 million by FY22 with 60 per cent of them paying an average of Rs 840 a month.  &amp;quot;In our bull-case, we look at a 24-month fair-value of the company as we believe most of the new businesses which are in gestation period will take around 24 months to acquire scale and contribute meaningfully to RIL's fair value,&amp;quot; it said.  Reliance Industries (RIL) is India's largest petrochemical and second-largest oil refining company. It has significant investments in telecom, consumer retail and media businesses in India. Its telecom subsidiary, Jio has garnered a large number of paying subscribers and has the opportunity to emerge as a top-three telecom player in a growing Indian market on the back of the launch of fiber-based broadband services.  The report said the &amp;quot;upside from base-case is predominately driven by new commerce gaining scale and helping B2B retail momentum as well ($32 billion in additional enterprise value); Jio gaining traction in enterprise, fixed broadband business + better than expected ad revenues/upselling services ($222 billion in additional EV); more pronounced telecom tariff hike ($10 bn in additional EV); and better than expected IMO contribution + lower capex for a couple of year&amp;quot;.  India's domestic shipping sector is to implement the International Maritime Organization's low sulfur mandate for marine fuels, which will raise margins for diesel.  The brokerage said retail will be the biggest driver of upside as the firm's new commerce business gains traction in the $800 billion unorganised markets.  &amp;quot;On an average, we expect 10 million Kirana's to contribute to RIL of Rs 750/month on back of its M-POS monthly fees and contribution from inventory management etc,&amp;quot; it said.  Stating that the entire cellular phone business industry would see a meaningful tariff hike by FY2022, it said telecom business of RIL will contribute more than a quarter of the projected EV (enterprise value).  Also, Jio's entry would expand the SME market - currently the majority of them do not use any enterprise offerings. &amp;quot;In the enterprise business, we expect Jio to target 15 million SME users. In this, we assume 60 per cent conversion (i.e. 9 million paying SME by FY22) and expect each SME to pay on an average Rs 2,000 per month,&amp;quot; it said.  It estimated the Jio's broadband business users would be 12 million by FY22, of which 60 per cent could pay an average of Rs 800 per cent, it said.  In the oil-to-chemicals business, it expected better than expected IMO impact, with refining margins moving to $13 per barrel from $11.

Customers on its network will be asked to pay 6 paisa per minute on outgoing voice calls made to non-Jio networks to recover the IUC which the company pays to other network providers.  IUC is what one mobile telecom operator pays to another, when its customers make outgoing mobile calls to the other operator&rsquo;s customers.  In this note, we attempt to analyse the impact of additional charges on RJio&rsquo;s financial performance and the impact on the stock price of Reliance Industries.  Catalyst for raising the tariffs  Earlier, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had decided to reduce IUC from 14 paise per min to 6 paise per min effective from October 1, 2017 and further to zero from January 1, 2020.  However, TRAI appears to be having second thoughts on whether to bring IUC down to zero or not, which has led to significant uncertainties for RJio. The company has in all paid nearly Rs.13,500 crore as net IUC charges to other operators.  Therefore, in light of this regulatory uncertainty RJio has decided to recover the IUC cost from its customers. It has, however, assured that this charge will be removed as soon as TRAI implements the zero IUC regime. In fact, RJIo is giving additional data along with the IUC top-up vouchers so that there is no effective tariff increase for the customer till 31st December 2019.  Implications for the sector  There is no direct benefit to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea from this move, as they would continue to get the same amount of IUC from RJio as earlier. But the decision augurs well for the entire industry, which has seen declining Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). This could lead to acceptance of higher tariffs by customers, thereby giving some leeway to service providers to increase tariffs. RJio, specifically, should be able to see an improvement in its operating margin.  Implications for the company  Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that levying IUC charges would lead to Rs3,624 crore incremental benefit in RJio&rsquo;s EBITDA, approximately 20 percent increment on the basis of annualised Q1 FY20 EBITDA.    What does this mean for the Reliance Industries stock?  The passing on of IUC to customers has been implemented only for one quarter till TRAI phases out IUC charges completely and hence there would not be much impact on the RJio&rsquo;s financial performance. If IUC is made nil then all companies will be on the same footing.  However, if IUC continues to remain in force even after one quarter, then it will mean that RJio will not have to continue to bear the costs of IUC for a longer than expected period. Our conservative SOTP (sum of the parts) suggests that the Reliance Industries&rsquo; stock could then get a 4 percentage points bump-up in compared to if the IUC charges were temporary (see chart). Keep a watch on the ongoing developments in this area to know what to expect.

Though the Nifty has fallen nearly 300 points from the recent high to a low of 11,390 levels, the primary trends is still intact as it is still trading above its 200-day SMA. Oscillators and momentum Indicators like RSI and MACD have been showing strength on the daily and weekly charts for the Nifty and Bank Nifty.   The index has formed a major bottom at 10,670 and rallied towards 11,695 recently. The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracements of the swing is placed at 11,303, which is likely to act as an immediate support going forward.  We have seen Put writing at 11,300-11,400 strike prices, indicating that the Nifty is likely to find strong support in the vicinity of 11,300-11,400. Unless the index closes below it, the trend would be considered bullish for the markets. On the upside, 11,700 would act as an immediate resistance where Calls have been written.  The Bank Nifty has formed a major bottom at 26,643 and rallied more than 4,000 points to touch an intraday high of 30,800. The 50 percent Fibonacci retracements of the entire swing is placed at 28,700, which is likely to act as an immediate support going forward. This support level coincides with the 200-day SMA placed at 28,766 levels.  The Nifty Smallcap index, which corrected nearly&nbsp;five percent from its recent high, has now reached a strong support of 20-day SMA, which is placed at 5,566 levels.&nbsp;The&nbsp;midcap/smallcap indices have also corrected and may see a bounceback from here on.  Considering technical and derivatives factors, we view the recent fall in the market as a correction in the overall uptrend. Our advice would be to use this correction to accumulate longs in the Nifty with the stop loss of 11,300 levels. On the higher side, the Nifty could move to its immediate resistance of 11,700. Any close above 11,700 levels would result in further short covering, which might push it to even 12,000 levels in coming months.  One should accumulate long positions in the Bank Nifty with a stop loss at 28,700 levels. On the higher side, an immediate resistance is seen in the vicinity of 29,800-30,000 levels.

Oscillators and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD showing strength in the stock on the daily and weekly charts. Therefore we recommend buying Reliance Industries for the upside target of Rs 1410, keeping a stop loss at Rs 1285.  UPL: Buy | Target: Rs 640 | Stop loss: Rs 580 | Return 6%  UPL has broken out on the daily chart by closing above the resistance level of Rs 598 levels. It also closed above 200-day SMA level of Rs 585 with higher volumes. Oscillators and momentum Indicators like RSI and MACD showing strength in the stock on the daily charts. In F&amp;amp;amp;O segment we have seen long build up in the stock. Therefore we recommend buying UPL for the target of Rs 640, keeping a stop loss at Rs 580.

In the offer document seeking bids for 5 million standard cubic meters per day of natural gas to be produced from R-Series fields in the block from mid-2020, Reliance and its partner BP plc have provided a draft of the Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) to be signed by potential buyers.  The GSPA provides for &amp;quot;immediate termination&amp;quot; of the agreement and recovery of any losses in case of violation of anti-bribery and anti-money laundering clauses.  Reliance and BP sought an undertaking that buyer or its affiliates had not bribed anyone in last five years and none of their directors, officers, or key employees has been convicted or investigated of any offence involving money laundering in last 10 years.  It sought indemnity for the sellers (Reliance and BP) from any loss or damage due to failure of contractors or third parties associated with buyers to comply with bribery and anti-money laundering laws.  The company asked the seller to inform it in writing of any breach of these laws by any of the contractors or third parties to the gas sale agreements.  Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites and MJ by 2022 to add 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas production in phases. A similar GSPA is likely for the other two sets of finds as well.  Reliance, which is the operator of KG-D6 with 60 per cent stake, has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3) -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.  The output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.3 mmscmd. MA field ceased to produce last year.  BP holds 30 per cent stake in the block while the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources of Canada.  The GSPA's an anti-bribery clause provides that the signatories or their affiliates or associated persons have not engaged any activity to &amp;quot;paying, offering or offering to give, promising or agreeing to give, or authorising the payment (directly or indirectly through any third party) of any monies... to any government official in order to obtain or retain business or to influence official action&amp;quot; in last five years.

Also, such contractors and third parties will have to comply with all of Bribery Acts and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, and &amp;quot;undertake to indemnify each of the sellers, their affiliates and associated persons against any loss or damages suffered on account of any failure by such contractors or third parties to comply with the aforesaid Laws,&amp;quot; it said.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

Reliance Brands already runs high-end stores in India with some 40 foreign partners, including British label Burberry, shoemaker Steve Madden and New York-based Iconix Brand Group Inc, through joint ventures and franchises.  It also wrapped up its first international acquisition in May, buying Hamleys, the world's oldest toy retailer, for $88.5 million. And it is not planning to stop there.  &amp;quot;The Hamleys acquisition ... has already whetted our appetite,&amp;quot; Reliance Brands CEO Darshan Mehta said in an interview in India's financial capital Mumbai.  &amp;quot;Internationally, much of brick and mortar retail is in a lot of pain,&amp;quot; he added at the Reliance Brands office plastered with photographs of models advertising its breadth of brands.  &amp;quot;No wonder - what may have once been available for 100 is now available for 50.&amp;quot;  Western companies &amp;quot;over built&amp;quot; their store estates and did not see the &amp;quot;e-commerce gorilla&amp;quot; coming, Mehta said. &amp;quot;Look around and you will always find many of them up for sale, whether it be in New York, London or Milan.&amp;quot;  Mehta declined to give details on talks. He said Reliance had no timeline and often took years to strike deals.  &amp;quot;You can't hurry love,&amp;quot; he said.  Reliance is already India's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in terms of revenue and number of stores. And Ambani, whom Forbes says is the world's 13th richest man, is also scaling up his grocery and wholesale businesses.  Reliance Brands' products are available at 788 locations spread across exclusive brand outlets, shopping malls and airports. The company is planning to open around 120 stores in India in the fiscal year to March 2020, Mehta said.  The company is also seeking to partner with brands in two segments where it so far does not have a presence: beauty and athletic lifestyle wear.  Multi-brand sports, wellness and fitness are the categories of interest for the company, Mehta said, adding women's and men's beauty products were also the target areas.  However, Reliance Brands - which Mehta said chiefly targets around 50 million affluent Indians - still remains a small part of the Reliance conglomerate, which made a net profit of $5.5 billion on $87 billion of revenue in the year ended March 2019.

Fitch said the outlook on the local-currency IDR was revised to positive due to RIL&rsquo;s potential to further deleverage.  The revisions come after Reliance on August 12 announced that it would reduce its net debt by the financial year ending March 2021 (FY21).  During the AGM, chairman Mukesh Ambani also announced that RIL would sell a 20 percent stake in its oil-to-chemical division to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco).  &amp;quot;This investment by Saudi Aramco is subject to due diligence, definitive agreements, regulatory and other customary approvals. This partnership will cover all of RIL's refining and petrochemicals assets, including 51 percent of the petroleum retail JV,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  The rating agency forecasts company's adjusted net debt/EBITDAR to reach 1.5x over the next 18 to 24 months. The company ended financial year 2018-19 with a net debt of Rs 1,54,478 crore.  &amp;quot;The affirmation of rating at 'BBB' reflect RIL's strong business profile&mdash;a large-scale refinery with a capacity of around 1.2 million barrels a day and industry-leading asset quality that enables it to consistently deliver a gross refining margin (GRM) above regional benchmarks,&amp;quot; Fitch said.  RIL also benefits from its vertically integrated business model and dominant market position in petrochemicals, which smooth outs profit volatility along the refining and petrochemical value chain, it added.  The company had completed capex to increase its downstream integration, which improved feedstock flexibility, it said.  Fitch expects RIL's digital-services business Jio to continue its strong growth. Jio has achieved a leading position in its wireless subscriber base, though it is still evolving, as reflected in the recent spinoff of its tower and fibre assets to investment trusts and plans to roll out a fibre-to-the-home business.  Jio had more than 340 million subscribers, Ambani said during the AGM. RIL was ready to kickstart internet of things (IoT), home broadband, enterprise and MSME broadband during the year, with an annual revenue opportunity for Jio at Rs 20,000 crore from IoT only, he said.  RIL's financial profile was also likely to improve, supported by strong operating cash flow from its expanded petrochemical and refining business, Fitch said.

Through aggressive pricing and marketing strategies, Jio has transformed the digital connectivity in India with affordable data tariffs and free voice services.  The company has penetrated the mobile broadband market at an exponential rate and garnered a user base of more than 300 million subscribers within three years of its launch in 2016. Since the start of this fiscal year, Jio has nosed ahead of Bharti&nbsp;Airtel in terms of subscriber base and now has a market share of around 28 percent. Vodafone Idea continues to dominate the market, but its user base has been shrinking since the launch of Jio.  At the AGM, the management gave insights into industry as well their business strategy for Jio, which assumes prime importance in Reliance&rsquo;s overall business.&nbsp; The company would continue to disrupt the entire value chain and intends to expand further deeper and wider market penetration into existing and newer markets.  Growth rates to moderate   Jio&rsquo;s financial performance has been improving on a sequential basis as the company continues to gain share from its competitors. In FY19, Jio&rsquo;s top line stood in excess of Rs 38,000 crore as the company increased its user base by nearly 50 percent. The operating margins were stable throughout and stood close to 38.9 percent for the full year.  While the consumer base has expanded, the pace of addition has slowed due to competitive intensity and base effect. During Q1, the company added 24 million subscribers at a run rate of 8 million per month. At this pace, the company is on track to achieve 500 million subscribers in the next 18-20 months. &nbsp;Considering the existing operating metrics in a favourable scenario, Jio&rsquo;s revenue run-rate would double over the next two years.  Our base case assumes a conservative stance taking into account a moderation in growth rate, higher customer churn rate and lower operating margins. Revenue as well as operating profits are anticipated to grow by 50 percent even under the base case.    New businesses have high revenue potential  Jio has already disrupted pre-paid mobile market and the company now plans to leverage the technology, infrastructure and user base to enter into newer business segments of the telecom market. At the AGM, the company announced that the trial runs for Jio Fiber are nearing completion and the home broadband services are expected to be rolled out commercially in the first week of September.  Similarly, the beta phase of enterprise broadband services are under way and the services will be rolled out officially next year. The company is also targeting Internet of Things (IoT) as it is an extension of Internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects. Through smart meters and other such devices, Jio aims to transform basic homes into smarter ones and gain share in the 20,000 crore IoT market.  The market size for home and enterprise broadband is pegged at 18 million and 45 million, respectively. At 5 percent market penetration, these two segments together could add another Rs 6,000 crore to Jio&rsquo;s top line in the next 2 years. The digital offering also stands to benefit from complimentary revenue streams such as interactive gaming as well as revenue and cost synergies related to the acquisition of cable operators - GTPL Hathway and Den networks.    Cash flows to improve, balance sheet to strengthen   Jio has been on an aggressive expansion spree as the company has invested nearly Rs 3.5 lakh crore towards establishing the largest optical fiber footprint in the country. The company has been going through structural and operational changes in recent months and has demerged about Rs 1.17 lakh crore of hard infrastructure into separate infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs).  The objective of this demerger is to take fibre and tower assets off the balance sheet, which would also lead to the debt associated with those assets being taken off. Jio has already entered an agreement with Brookfield Infrastructure for an investment of Rs 25,215 crore into Tower InvIT. The money will be used to repay existing financial liabilities of Jio, which are estimated at around Rs 1,70,000 crore (EBITDA cover of ~9x ).    Jio&rsquo;s high capex, leverage and weak cash flow have been a key concern for Reliance&rsquo;s shareholders. However, the business is 5G ready and the capex cycle is nearing the completion phase and has enough spare capacity to match up to the growing demand. Going forward, free cash flows should improve substantially on the back of monetisation of tower assets, commercialisation of fibre business and minimal capex requirements. This augurs well for shareholders as increasing free cash flows would help deleverage the balance sheet and improve its return ratios over the next couple of years.

The good news from the company's AGM is not just the roadmap to net zero debt by end of FY21, but a gradual change from a cyclical commodity play to one which will be increasingly driven by consumer facing businesses. And that means much more stable, predictable cash flow and hence better rewards for the investors.  Strategic partnership to correct capital allocation in legacy businesses  While staying with the basic businesses which it has painstakingly build, the big investments for the future are being made elsewhere. BP is acquiring 49% stake in the petro-retail business for Rs 7000 crore. Reliance and Saudi Aramco have agreed to form a long-term Partnership whereby the later will invest in Reliance for a 20% stake in Oil to Chemicals division at an enterprise value of US$ 75 billion. This deal covers all of RIL's refining and petrochemicals assets, including 51% of the petroleum retail joint venture. In the exploration business too, the driver will be the joint venture with BP. The focus will gradually be on higher value added products, like speciality chemicals and away from commoditised products.    The incremental focus will be the consumer facing businesses and by Chairman Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s own admission, it will not be long before they make up for half of the consolidated EBITDA.  Why this proposition is so unique?  However, what is more interesting about the new Reliance&rsquo;s strategy is the enviable reach into every aspect of Indian life (through Jio, entertainment and retail) and the access to the wealth of data on Indian population/business that will be totally irreplicable by any competitor. This will provide tremendous cross-selling opportunity or entering any-consumer facing business much easier at a later date.  Let us turn to Jio first. With 340 million strong customer base and addition of more than 10 million new customers every month, the half a billion customer milestone is well within sight.  However, what is music to the ears of the shareholders is the fact that the big capex phase (invested close to Rs 3.5 lakh crore) in telecom is coming to an end and it is time to reap benefits by effectively sweating the assets. Reliance plans to do that with its multipronged strategy.  The company has already started reducing debt in the balance sheet with divestment of about Rs 1.17 lakh crore of hard infrastructure into separate infrastructure investment trusts or InvITs to better monetize and unlock value from these assets. The company is eyeing new revenue streams to better leverage the assets created through pan-India offerings like Internet of Things or IoT, home broadband, enterprise broadband and broadband for small and medium businesses. With strong revenue traction and minimal capex, cash flow should improve remarkably in the future.  Jio aims to connect at least 1 billion devises on its IoT platform, translating to Rs &nbsp;20,000 crore per annum revenue opportunity. Jio Fiber plans to cover 20 million residences and 15 million business in 1,600 towns. High speed broadband connectivity, digital set top box, landline phone connection, free calls within India, smart home solutions, a television set, automatic subscription to leading OTT platform are all the carrots offered that should enable faster penetration of Jio Fiber.  For businesses, Jio will give easier and cheaper access to blockchain technology all over India, In partnership with Microsoft, Jio would set up a network of large world-class datacenters across India wherein Microsoft will bring its Azure cloud platform. So Jio aims to capture lion&rsquo;s share of technology spend by Indian businesses, going forward.  The connectivity and cloud infrastructure would be available for free for startups and for a very economical rate for small and medium enterprises. But for Jio the long-term gains in terms of partnership with these businesses and knowledge and understanding of the customer ecosystem will be invaluable.  The understanding and knowledge of every customer and every small and aspiring business in India will give the group an unparalleled database that its retail business can ride on successfully.  Jio a driver for retail as well  The retail business has grown phenomenally, registering a 7-fold increase in revenue and a 14-fold increase in profit in the last six years. It is the best proxy for the consumption story of India.  The business has achieved a significant milestone with our turnover crossing Rs 1,30,000 crore in the last year with an EBIDTA margin of 4.7 percent, which is better than most retailers.  What&rsquo;s in for the shareholders?  With a gradual de-focus on cyclical commodity businesses and thrust on consumer-facing ones, the shareholders should be looking at substantial value unlocking, going forward.

In particular, a concrete deadline of 18 months for reducing the net debt to zero will assuage the concerns of investors and analysts, some of whom were calling attention to the company&rsquo;s rising liabilities.  Under the deal with Saudi Aramco -- the largest foreign investment in RIL&rsquo;s history -- the Saudi petroleum major will buy 20 percent in RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemicals business at an enterprise value of $75 billion or approximately 5.25 lakh crore.  At the end of financial year 2018-19, RIL had net debt of Rs 1.54 lakh on its books. RIL&rsquo;s deal with Saudi Aramco and BP, monetisation of telecom assets through an infrastructure investment trust, strong investor interest in Jio and Reliance Retail, and the proposed monetisation of real estate and financial investments should help the group achieve the net zero debt target within the deadline.  Ambani said the deals with Aramco and BP would be completed within this financial year and that the proceeds from the two deals were about Rs 1.1 lakh crore.  He added that the group had received &ldquo;strong interest and commitments from reputed global investors&rdquo; for telecom assets worth around Rs 1.25 lakh crore that were spun off and housed in an infrastructure investment trust. Ambani expressed confidence that the transactions would be completed by the end of this financial year.  RIL&rsquo;s stated objective of both consumer-centric businesses (retail, telecom) and the legacy businesses contributing equally to the overall revenues over the next decade, appears to be on track.  The consumer businesses now collectively contribute nearly 32 percent to the consolidated operating profits, up from 2 percent five years ago.  In his speech, Ambani said that RIL had proved skeptics wrong that the group could not succeed in consumer businesses.  &ldquo;Jio and Reliance Retail have proved them wrong. If these two consumer businesses had been separately listed companies, each would be ranked among the top 10 in India today, in terms of value,&rdquo; Ambani said.  Ambani said the investment cycle for Jio was now complete and that only marginal investments in access were now required to build capacity to meet growing demand. This gives the business huge operating leverage and would result in robust returns over the years.  Jio will now bet on Internet of Things, and broadband for homes and businesses as its next growth engines.  In the retail business, Ambani said that Reliance Retail had cemented its position as India&rsquo;s number one retailer with a turnover of Rs 1.3 lakh crore last year.  Ambani highlighted the fact that milestone was achieved faster than any other retail company in the world, and that Reliance Retail&rsquo;s operating profit margins were among the best globally.  RIL has plans to take both Jio and Reliance Retail public over the next five years.  Ambani said that the group had received &ldquo;strong interest from strategic and financial investors&rdquo; for both businesses.  On the slowdown in the economy, Ambani said that it was temporary as the fundamentals of the economy were quite strong and there was political stability.  &ldquo;The opportunities will grow further with structural reforms. The government is laying the foundation of new institutions for business promotion and regulation,&rdquo; Ambani said.  He assured shareholders that as RIL achieved a net zero debt target, they would be rewarded &ldquo;abundantly through higher dividends, periodic bonus issues and other means, and at a more accelerated pace than any time in our history.&rdquo;  Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.

Reliance will sell 20 percent stake in oil to chemical business to Saudi Aramco, he said. The company also announced a long-term agreement with Microsoft to accelerate &ldquo;digital transformation of India to launch new cloud data centres, ensuring more organisations can access the tools and platforms they need to build their own digital capability&rdquo;.  The stocks rallied from Rs 964, recorded on July 5, 2018 when RIL held its 41st AGM, to Rs 1,162 on August 9, translating into a gain of more than 20 percent.  The share touched its 52-week high Rs 1,413.75 and 52-week low Rs 1,017 on May 2, 2019 and October 25, 2018, respectively. It is trading 17.81 percent below its 52-week high and 14.26 percent above its 52-week low.  Here is what some experts/analysts&rsquo; say on how shares will react on August 13:  Gagan Dixit, vice president, oil &amp;amp;amp; gas analyst, Elara Capital:  The combined value of Aramco&rsquo;s refining and petchem at USD 75 billion (Elara: USD 73 billion) is positive. It will provide much-needed capital for oil-to-chemicals expansion plans in a phased manner over the next decade, as mentioned by RIL FY19 annual report. We estimate 12mnMT rise in petchem capacity should require another around $11bn in long term.  But in near term, it's a positive development that Rs 1.05 trillion available from Aramco and Rs 0.8-0.9 trillion/annum operating cash flow would help de-leverage RIL within two years.  We believe key trigger for conclusion of RIL-Aramco deal was declining probability of Maharashtra refinery of OMCs, where Aramco committed earlier as its cost jumped Rs 3 trillion to Rs 4 trillion due to delays and environment-related commitments.  Ajay Bodke, CEO at PMS Prabhudas Lilladher:  Market is going to heartily welcome the seminal announcement by RIL, India's largest and most respected company, of 20 percent stake sale in its oil-to-chemical (OTC) business to the world's largest oil company Saudi Aramco.  It reinforces Mukesh Ambani's reputation as India's top business leader, whose global vision has transformed the country's economic milieu. This is inarguably India's largest-ever FDI inflow and would help dissipate the gloomy sentiment pervading the economy and stock markets.  This programme to aggressively pursue deleveraging in businesses such as OTC, fibre and tower and emerge as a zero-debt company in the next 18 months will strengthen the consolidated balance sheet leading to strong valuation re-rating of the stock. RIL continues to remain as the pre-eminent player on the Indian economic juggernaut that is likely to touch $10 trillion by 2030.  SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com:  The stock could open 4-5 percent, or Rs 50-70, higher on August 13, SP Tulsian said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  He expects the stock to breach its Rs 1,400-mark and to see a new high in 2019. It is an excellent stock to buy given the kind of expected revenue increase with zero-net debt status in the coming 18 months.  He had said earlier that Credit Suisse concerns over $65 billion debt was not the right amount and had been bothering market a lot in the last few sessions, Tulsian said. With a net worth of Rs 4 lakh crore and businesses ranging from refinery, oil-to-chemical, retail to Jio, it would definitely cheer the market and profit will rise in next two or three years through asset monetisation and Saudi Aramco deal which is EPS accretive, he said.  Deven Choksey, MD of KR Choksey Investment Managers:  Those looking to invest in the company, could still put in money at current levels, as the stocks could reach a new high in 2019, and more than double in the next 2 years, Deven Choksey, MD of KR Choksey Investment Managers, told CNBC-TV18.  Sanjeev Jain, VP Equity Research at Sunness Capital India Pvt Ltd:  The chance of the stock touching new highs is strong in 2019. The Aramco deal as well as the joint venture with BP are the key positives. The company has laid out a plan to become debt-free by FY21. I expect the market may take it positively and a gap-up opening is possible on August 13.  Rajiv Sharma, SPICAP Securities:  From Vodafone Idea perspective, Jio aims to increase subscriber base from 340 million to 500 million, with a run rate of 10 million per month, which means no immediate respite in the Indian wireless space. Jio will continue to be aggressive on customer acquisition.&nbsp;After the Aramco deal, a&nbsp;tariff hike looks very unlikely.&nbsp;So, from a Vodafone-Idea perspective on the wireless side, I think this is negative as there will be no immediate relief, which they really needed,&nbsp; Sharma told CNBC-TV18.  Jal Irani, oil and gas analyst at Edelweiss Financial Services:  There is a vertical and horizontal integration to generate value. Retail and Jio are in the process of that value creation, Irani said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  It is a game-changer AGM, given JioFiber's price plan at Rs 700 with potential revenue generation of Rs 14,000 crore under telecom business, focus on retail business, deal with the Saudi Aramco and plan to become a debt-free company.  Reliance generally invests in new-age businesses early, grooms them and monetises them early rather than wait for a long period of 20 years, he added.  Nitin Soni, Fitch Ratings:  Mukesh Ambani's whole presentation is quite compelling. The pricing plan for JioFiber at Rs 700, with speed from 100 Mbps to Ggbps is a game-changer with affordable rates, along with first day first show movies on Jio and cross-selling of various services, Soni said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  Prakash Diwan, altamountcapital.com  As Reliance moved from B2B to B2C, Diwan expects more than 50 percent contribution from B2C to revenue in the years to come.  Also RIL moving from oil business to oil-to-chemicals (OTC) indicates that it is moving out of traditional business, hence thumbs up to its adaptability, Diwan said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  Company started with telecom, then entertainment, media and now internet of things (IoT) technology, which is a strong conversion. For these things, valuations in China and the US are phenomenal. Hence, overall the AGM is very strong.  The stock lost more than 20 percent in last three months due to debt concerns. But with Saudi Aramco deal and Jio asset monetisation, its aims to be zero-debt company in 18 months will change a lot of calculations in terms of valuations and stock price in days to come, he added.  Also with dividend yield of 15 percent and expectations of reaching around 25 percent plus zone, the stock re-rating will be high.  The telecom business plan was an absolute killer for Vodafone Idea, but Bharti Airtel may not feel the pinch,&nbsp;Diwan said.  Sameer Kalra, founder, Target Investing:  Keeping buy rating, we believe this clearly lays down the path of divestment to repay the debt, which certain investors were doubting.  Next 12 months of new products and launch will set a high-growth phase, which will generate higher cash flows as reduction of debt and only maintained capex will be required."

(RIL) CMD Mukesh Ambani addressed the company&rsquo;s 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 12. Here&rsquo;s the full text of the address:  My Dear Shareowners,  A very warm good morning to each and every one of you.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 42nd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited.  The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2019, along with the Directors' and Auditors' report, a Letter to the Shareholders, and Management's Discussion and Analysis, have already been circulated to you.  With your permission, I would like to take them as read.  1.&nbsp;Business and Financial Performance  Dear Shareholders,  In the Golden Decade of Reliance, I am proud to inform you that it was yet another year of robust and record performance.  Reliance became India's largest and most profitable company - both in public and private sectors.  We are the only diversified multi-sector Indian enterprise with three major growth engines in one single corporate entity  &ndash; Oils to Chemicals division, Jio and Retail.  All three have done exceedingly well in the past year.  We are also incubating newer growth engines.  Sceptics used to say that Reliance cannot succeed in consumer businesses.  Jio and Reliance Retail have proved them wrong.  If these two consumer businesses had been separately listed companies, each would be ranked among the top 10 in India today, in terms of value.  Jio crossed the 340 million subscriber mark to remain the world's fastest growing digital services company.  Today, Jio is India's largest telecom enterprise in terms of subscribers, revenues and profits.  Jio has truly become the DIGITAL GATEWAY OF INDIA.  Reliance Retail has crossed ` 130,000 crore turnover to cement its position as India's largest retailer.  It is four times larger than the 2nd largest retail player. It is larger than all the other major retailers put together.  Our two consumer businesses now collectively contribute nearly 32% to the consolidated EBITDA, up from 2% five years ago.  The day is not far when their share would be 50%. The third growth engine is our Oils to Chemicals business.  Let me now highlight Reliance's record contribution to the Indian economy:  Largest exporter -- Rs 2,24,391 crore exports to 107 countries accounting for 9.8% of India's total merchandise exports.  Highest payer of customs and excise duty in the private sector -- Rs 26,379 crore.  Highest payer of GST amongst all public and private sector companies -- Rs 67,320 crore.  Highest payer of Income tax in the private sector -- Rs 12,191 crore.  Dear Shareholders,  The coming year will mark the beginning of the most ambitious Value Creation strategy in the history of Reliance and in the history of India.  At the heart of our new value creation strategy is our innovative Philosophy of transforming relationships into partnerships.  Partnerships with leading global and Indian companies.  Partnerships with millions of local businesses, SMEs and micro-enterprises across India.  Partnerships with new tech-enabled businesses, platforms and social enterprises.  All these partnerships will form a new business coalition capable of creating exponential value for our five stakeholders: Indian economy, Indian people, our customers, employees and shareowners.  Dear Shareholders,  The future of India &ndash; and also the future of Reliance -- has never looked brighter to me than now.  As India is getting transformed into New India, Reliance will also transform itself into New Reliance.  Our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has set the goal of making India a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024. I fully endorse this ambitious goal.  Indeed, I can clearly see India becoming a 10 trillion dollar economy by 2030, with every Indian as a beneficiary. This is achievable. This is necessary. This is inevitable.  I say this because digital-driven GDP growth is not only exponential but can also be inclusive.  Our own value creation strategy will prove this. The slowdown in some sectors of the economy is temporary. The fundamentals of the Indian economy are very strong. The opportunities will grow further with structural reforms. India has political stability.  The government is laying the foundation of new institutions for business promotion and regulation.  New long-term measures are being taken to improve ease of living for all citizens, and reduce income inequality. India is rising. No power on earth can stop India from rising higher.  2. Oils to Chemicals Business  Dear Shareowners,  Let me focus on Reliance's most valuable business today &ndash; the Oils to Chemicals division.  It is formed by combining our petrochemicals and refining businesses.  Reliance has the most complex and integrated Oils to Chemicals business globally.  Our Oils to Chemicals business has the ability to convert oil into high-value chemicals and new materials that will significantly improve the quality of life of Indians.  As the world moves towards renewable energy sources and electric vehicles, Reliance has positioned itself far ahead of the curve to create new value.  At Jamnagar, we now operate with a Complexity Index of over 21.1, which is the highest globally for a refinery.  Higher complexity signifies a high degree of integration of units, feed flexibility, product manufacturing capability and, consequently, the ability to maximize margins.  Our Oils to Chemicals business achieved revenue of Rs 5.7 lakh crore, exports of Rs 2.2 lakh crore and EBITDA of Rs 52,041 crore.  We processed 68.3 million tons of crude during the year maintaining our record of over 100% operating rate.  Despite a challenging global environment, we achieved a GRM of $9.2 per barrel, maintaining a margin of $4.2 per barrel over the Singapore complex.  We derived the full benefits of Refinery Off-Gas Cracker by increasing polymer production by 18% to 5.8 MMT.  The Ethane sourcing investment achieved superior returns as we capitalized on the feedstock flexibility in a volatile environment.  All units of the Gasification complex have been safely commissioned.  The Gasification complex is tightly integrated with the refinery and petrochemical complex at Jamnagar.  Our focus is now on completing this integration, capacity utilization and efficiency.  The Butyl Rubber project with equity and technology from SIBUR of Russia, one of the global leaders in this business, is nearing completion and will be commissioned this year.  This is a great example of India-Russia cooperation.  Reliance and BP signed a Joint-venture in the petroleum retailing business.  In a significant new initiative, BP is acquiring 49% stake in our petro-retail business.  Reliance will get Rs 7,000 crore from BP for this transaction.  Dear Shareholders,  I am now delighted to make an announcement about the biggest foreign investment in the history of Reliance.  It is also among the largest foreign investments in India.  Saudi Aramco and Reliance have agreed to form a long-term Partnership in our Oil to Chemicals (O2C) division.  In terms of the understanding between the parties, Saudi Aramco will invest in Reliance for a 20% stake in Oil to  Chemicals division at an Enterprise Value of US$ 75 Billion for the O2C division.  This investment by Saudi Aramco is subject to due diligence, definitive agreements, regulatory and other customary approvals.  This Partnership will cover all of RIL's Refining and Petrochemicals assets, including 51% of the Petroleum Retail JV.  Saudi Aramco will also supply 500 KBPD of Crude Oils on a long term basis to RIL's Jamnagar refinery.  This signifies perfect synergy between the world's largest oil producer and the world's largest integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex.  Since its inception, our Jamnagar refinery has been processing Saudi oil every single day for 20 years.  Now we have transformed our longstanding relationship of two decades, based on mutual trust, into a Partnership of growth potential for many more years.  I feel privileged to welcome Saudi Aramco, which is the largest business enterprise in the world.  I am grateful to the visionary leaders, Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, who have laid the foundation for strategic cooperation between India and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  3. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production  Dear Shareholders,  I am happy that the Natural Gas business will soon regain its place of pride in Reliance's value-creation strategy.  With Reliance de-emphasising its Shale Gas business in the USA, we are currently focused only on India. In our coal bed methane blocks, we are focusing on augmenting production. The Joint Venture with BP will play a major role as a producer of natural gas.  With world class deep-water infrastructure in the east coast of India, the JV is uniquely positioned to monetize over 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered resources in the KG D6 block.  Our JV has committed an investment of Rs 35,000 crore in the three deep water fields in this block.  The projects to develop these gas-fields are amongst the most complex, being executed anywhere in the world. These will commence production from the first half of 2020.  With an expected peak production of one billion cubic feet per day, equivalent to nearly 30% of India's current indigenous gas production, the JV will emerge as a major contributor to India's energy security.  	 Reliance Jio &ndash; Our Digital Services Initiative  Dear Friends,  Now, I turn to the youngest member of the Reliance family &ndash; JIO.  India is today a USD 2.5 Trillion economy.  Statistics from large economies show that nearly 3%-5% of their GDP is spent on digital services.  Even at 3% this translates to a potential Indian digital service spend of nearly 5 LAKH CRORES annually.  I believe that JIO is ideally placed to earn a significant proportion of this technology-driven value-addition to our economy.  Friends,  JIO was founded with a vision to bring DIGITAL LIFE to every Indian.  And this vision was built on TWO pillars:  The FIRST was DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY, where JIO would connect EVERY-ONE, EVERY-PLACE and EVERYTHING with the highest quality and affordability.  And the SECOND was to build DIGITAL PLATFORMS and SOLUTIONS built to suit the unique requirements of India and Indians spanning all walks of life like entertainment, ecommerce, financial services, education, healthcare, agriculture, eGovernance and everything beyond.  Let me begin with DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY.  On 5th September this year JIO turns THREE years old.  And what an incredible THREE YEARS it has been!  In the sacred Upanishads we have the famous mantra TAMASOMA JYOTHIR GAMAYA which means lead us from darkness to light.  In a manner of speaking, before JIO, India was DATA DARK.  And now with JIO, India is DATA SHINING BRIGHT!  Friends,  Today JIO's customer base has crossed 340 million users.  And still we are signing up more than 10 million new customers EACH MONTH.  The potential for growth is immense, and HALF A BILLION customers is now well within our reach.  On behalf of the entire JIO family, thank you India for the ENORMOUS TRUST that you have placed in us.  Because of you, JIO has become NOT JUST the largest operator in India BUT ALSO the second largest single country operator in the world!  Dear Shareholders,  Your company has invested nearly Rs 3.5 LAKH CRORE towards creating a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure across  India, with the largest optical fiber footprint.  Recently we have divested about Rs 1.17 lakh crore of hard infrastructure into separate infrastructure investment trusts or InvITs to better monetize and unlock value from these assets.  Through these investments we have created world-class, legacy-free, future-proof assets all of which are fixed-mobile converged.  The core and aggregation layers of our converged network have been 5G ready since day one.  And because of our early adoption of the ongoing enhancements to LTE technology our wireless network is already 4G  PLUS.  And we can upgrade this to 5G at minimum incremental cost.  Thanks to JIO's converged network architecture we can offer even faster fixed line broadband to homes and business establishments TODAY.  Friends,  Unlike other industry players your company had the foresight to PRE-INVEST in the network assets.  And for this reason, I can report to you today that the investment cycle for Jio is now complete.  Only marginal investments in access are now required to grow capacity to meet growing demand.  This gives us tremendous OPERATING LEVERAGE and SUPERIOR RETURNS on our INVESTMENTS for years to come.  Friends,  While most of our investments are complete, we have so far fired up JUST ONE of the engines of Revenue generation for Jio namely mobile broadband.  Even with one engine Jio has been profitable from its first quarter of commercial operations.  And now we are ready to kick-start FOUR more engines of CONNECTIVITY REVENUE for Jio.  INTERNET OF THINGS or IoT all over India.  HOME BROADBAND.  ENTERPRISE BROADBAND.  And BROADBAND for SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES.  And I am glad to report that the Revenues from each of these engines will kick-in within THIS FINANCIAL YEAR ITSELF.  Let me now describe these new growth engines.  FIRST Internet of Things.  JIO has developed an innovative service on its pan-India 4G network called Narrowband Internet-of-Things or NBIoT, for short.  Using NBIoT data from billions of smart sensors whether residential, industrial or public can be collected from across  India with the highest reliability and lowest cost.  To take just one example there are over 300 million electricity meters which need to be connected digitally for real-time monitoring and for giving consumers full visibility and control of cost and quality.  And going forward each home and business premise will have dozens of connected devices.  Within another 2 years, it is estimated that there will be more than 2 Billion Connected IOT devices in our country.  Jio aims to connect at least 1 BILLION of these on JIO's IoT platform.  This translates into a Rs 20,000 CRORE PER YEAR revenue opportunity for JIO.  Jio's IoT platform will be commercially available starting 1st January, 2020.  Now the SECOND engine Home broadband.  Last year I had shared with you JIO's plans for optical-fiber-based FIXEDLINE BROADBAND service &ndash; called JIOFIBER.  Starting August 15th of last year, we invited registrations of interest from across India so that we could prioritize  JIOFIBER rollout into localities with the highest interest.  The response was simply overwhelming.  We received over 15 million registrations from nearly 1,600 towns.  And based on these registrations, we have drawn up a plan to reach 20 million residences and 15 million business establishments in these 1,600 towns.  Over the past year, we have built significant momentum in our JIOFIBER rollout and we are confident that we will complete our network rollout within the next 12 months.  During the last year we also installed JIOFIBER &ndash; on a trial basis &ndash; in nearly HALF A MILLION homes to fine-tune our services based on actual customer feedback.  And we have found that these trial homes on average are consuming more than 100 GBs per month and this usage is increasing with each passing day.  Friends,  With JIOFIBER you get lightning fast broadband speeds of up to 1 GBPS.  You get a landline phone connection, at no additional cost.  And you get a DIGITAL SET-TOP-BOX that opens up unparalleled digital experiences within your home.  ULTRA HIGH DEFINITION ENTERTAINMENT, VIRTUAL REALITY content, MULTI-PARTY VIDEO CONFERENCING, VOICE-ENABLED VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS, INTERACTIVE GAMING, HOME SECURITY and many other SMART-HOME SOLUTIONS, The digital possibilities are endless.  THEN THERE IS TELEVISION which is still at the heart of the Indian home.  Television services in India is a classic small-businesses success story, where Local Cable Operators or LCOs played a pioneering role.  In recent years, competition from DTH operators have threatened the viability of nearly 1 lakh LCOs who still operate across India.  As firm supporters of local and small businesses JIO wanted to ensure that these LCOs continued to serve their communities.  Earlier this year RIL acquired controlling stakes in three leading Cable MSOs &ndash; Hathway, DEN and GTPL who have direct relationships with over 30,000 LCOs.  Over the past months we have worked with our MSOs to upgrade their infrastructure to world-class standards.  After these upgrades, our LCO partners will now be able to offer the largest bouquet of High-Definition channels to customers with better features, reliability and customer experience than even DTH.  But, now we have gone one step further.  We have designed our JIO SET-TOP-BOX to accept the broadcast cable TV signals from our LCO partners.  So that with every JIOFIBER home all our LCO partners will continue to have a steady stream of revenue for their broadcast TV business.  We look forward to extending this partnership to all LCOs across the country.  Now For SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES.  JIOFIBER enables a powerful combination of FIXED-LINE CONNECTIVITY and CLOUD APPLICATIONS leapfrogging them from NO TECHNOLOGY to having a complete line-up of cutting-edge, plug-and-play technology enabled tools.  This will make them productive from day-one and empower them to succeed in the marketplace even against much larger enterprises.  I believe that in their success lies the recipe for sustainable growth and large-scale employment for the Indian economy.  And FINALLY, LARGE ENTERPRISES.  In the past, enterprises had no choice but to make large expenditures of time, money and effort to keep pace with technology.  Today cloud-based solutions provide out-of-the-box capabilities which are easier, faster and cheaper to adopt.  JIOFIBER and JIO's cloud solutions level the playing field for Indian enterprises enabling them to accelerate their digital transformation and compete globally using the very same technologies that are used by global majors.  Friends  Now let me turn to the obvious question.  When is JIOFIBER going to be available, and how much will it cost?  TODAY I want to ANNOUNCE that starting 5th SEPTEMBER of this year - on the THIRD anniversary of JIO's launch - we are launching JIOFIBER services on a COMMERCIAL basis.  Let me now give you a PREVIEW of the JIOFIBER tariffs.  Jio tariffs are based on FOUR strong and powerful principles.  First principle:  JioFiber will launch with a line-up of simple and easy to understand tariff plans.  On performance - the average fixed-line download speed in the US which is the most developed economy is around 90 Mbps.  In India even the most basic JIOFIBER plan STARTS WITH 100 Mbps speed and we have plans all the way up to 1 Gbps or 1000 Mbps.  This will disproportionately improve the quality of fixed-line data in India.  And on price - we are pricing our plans at less than 1/10th the global rates, to make it accessible for all.  JioFiber plans will be priced between Rs 700 to Rs 10,000 per month to suit every budget and every need.  Second:  Customers should pay for only one service, either voice or data. Not both.  With this, I am pleased to announce that voice calls from HOME to any Indian operator - mobile or fixed - will be ABSOLUTELY FREE Forever.  On Fixed-Line International Voice Calling - we are today ending the era of high international calling rates on landline.  By announcing the LOWEST FIXED LINE RATES for International Calling through 2 initiatives.  First, the default tariffs on your Jio HOME PHONE will be one-fifth to one-tenth of existing industry tariffs.  Second, we are announcing an unlimited international calling pack at ` 500 per month, to US and Canada, thereby making it easy for families to connect.  Third:  We are SUBSTANTIALLY simplifying the purchase and consumption of content.  Today many of us pay for and keep track of multiple subscriptions to multiple applications just to watch our favourite movies and shows.  This is both expensive and cumbersome.  Today, I am announcing that JIOFIBER plans will come BUNDLED with subscriptions to most leading premium OTT applications.  Also, for the first time in India, we are introducing a disruptive concept for watching NEW movies.  Premium JIOFIBER customers will be able to watch movies in their living rooms the same day these movies are released in theatres!  We call this JIO FIRST-DAY-FIRST-SHOW.  We plan to launch this service in the middle of 2020.  Fourth:  We are launching a special mobility service for our JioFiber users called JIO POSTPAID PLUS, to deliver a platinum-grade service and product experience.  Some of the unique features of this service are:  One, India's first priority SIM-setup service at home, where your connection will be moved to Jio by visiting your home.  Two, Seamless Data and Voice Connectivity across all your devices, both at home and outside.  Three, Unprecedented Family plans &ndash; one data plan for better control on GBs and sharing within your family.  Four, International roaming at a fraction of a cost with superior service experience.  Five, Phone upgrades at preferential rates.  And Six, all your home solutions on your phone.  The complete details of our tariffs will be available from 5th September 2019 on Jio.com and MyJio application.  BUT, there is ONE MORE THING.  The experience of JIOFIBER and JIO-SET-TOP-BOX really comes to life when combined with an LED TELEVISION.  So, JIOFIBER customers who opt for our annual plans which we call JIO-FOREVER plans, will get an HD OR 4K LED  TELEVISION and a 4K SET-TOP-BOX ABSOLUTELY FREE.  We are calling this the JIOFIBER WELCOME OFFER.  I invite all of you to make the most of THE JIOFIBER WELCOME OFFER and sign-up for JIOFIBER as soon as it is available in your neighbourhoods.  Friends,  Let me now move to the SECOND PILLAR of JIO DIGITAL LIFE.  DIGITAL PLATFORMS and SOLUTIONS.  Today, JIO is already a software company.  JIO has over 6000 software engineers and we are continuing to attract technology talent from across India and the world.  JIO is also investing in a growing ecosystem of technology startups.  As on date we have invested in 14 startups that embody the JIO DNA and have developed unique capabilities in their respective fields with a total of 1500 talented engineers.  This is another way we are building talent.  And on the back of this talent we are now investing in scaling-up advanced technologies in our country even ahead of the rest of the world.  Let me describe our plans for a few of these.  FIRST, Blockchain technology all over India.  Using Blockchain we can deliver unprecedented security, trust, automation and efficiency to almost any type of transaction.  This is a vital capability for India especially for modernizing our supply chains for agricultural produce and other goods which form the lifeblood of our economy.  And using Blockchain, we also have an opportunity to invent a brand-new model for data privacy where Indian data especially customer data is owned and controlled through technology by the Indian people and not by corporates, especially global corporations.  Data is wealth and Indian wealth must remain in India.  Over the next 12 months, JIO will install across India one of the largest blockchain networks in the world with tens of thousands of nodes operational on day one.  SECOND, Edge computing and Virtual and Mixed Reality content.  As you saw in the demo, the next frontier of content is immersive.  This creates exciting new possibilities for entertainment, shopping, gaming and most importantly for education.  Delivering immersive content to hundreds of millions of users requires a well-integrated solution spanning connectivity, data storage and real-time computing.  And we need to deploy such solutions at the edge of the network or in other words, closer to where our users are.  Today, JIO is setting up a pan-India Edge Computing and Content Distribution network again starting with tens of thousands of nodes.  This means that your favourite content and applications will be even nearer to you.  So even faster downloads and faster response times.  And FINALLY, CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE across India.  To leapfrog the world, it is a national imperative to develop a nation-wide cloud computing infrastructure that is both cutting-edge and affordable.  There are just a handful of companies in the world who can be considered at the cutting-edge of cloud technologies.  I want to talk to you about one such company MICROSOFT.  Today, MICROSOFT's Cloud platform AZURE is one of the world's leading cloud platforms.  Today, I am glad to announce that Jio and Microsoft have entered into a globally unique long-term alliance to accelerate the digital transformation of our country.  As part of this alliance, while Jio sets up a network of large world-class datacenters across India, Microsoft will bring its Azure cloud platform into Jio's datacenters.  When we put these two pieces together, we now have the capability to develop truly India-native solutions including Speech Recognition and Natural language understanding for all major Indian languages and dialects.  All Indian businesses now have the capacity to accelerate their digital transformations and become globally competitive.  On this VERY IMPORTANT occasion I want to welcome in our midst a very special guest to talk about this partnership.  My dear friend and the CEO of MICROSOFT &ndash; India's own Satya Nadella!  Script of Mr. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft  &ldquo;Thank you, Mukesh.  It is such an incredible time to embark upon this partnership together.  Today, digital technology is transforming every place, every industry, everything. This rapid change is being driven by massive technology shifts &ndash; across the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge:  Computing is becoming ubiquitous and distributed.  AI is being infused into every experience.  And the interaction model we have with computers is increasingly human-first, rather than device-first.  These advances are shaping the next phase of innovation, and they are creating new opportunity for people and organizations everywhere, especially in India.  At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.  Core to this mission is deep partnerships, like the one we announced today with Jio.  Our ambition is to help millions of organizations across India thrive and grow in this era of rapid technological change.  Our long-term partnership combines the power of our technology &ndash; including Azure, Azure AI and Office 365 &ndash; with Jio's connectivity and digital solutions &ndash; which as you know are among the most used and fastest-growing in the world.  Together, we will offer comprehensive technology solutions &ndash; from compute and storage, to connectivity and productivity &ndash; to SMBs everywhere in the country.  Jio and Microsoft will partner to launch new cloud datacenters in India, ensuring more organizations can access the tools and platforms they need to build their own digital capability.  Jio and Microsoft will jointly offer Office 365 so more organizations can empower their employees with a modern workplace.  And Jio and Microsoft will bring Azure Cognitive Services to more devices, creating new, breakthrough intelligent experiences, with support for 13 Indian languages and others to come.  At Microsoft, we don't celebrate technology for echnology's sake, but rather we celebrate what others are empowered to do with that technology.  And our ambition is to make all of these solutions broadly accessible and affordable so they can reach as many people and organizations in India as possible.  I'm excited to see how customers will be able to achieve more because of this partnership and I'm excited about our collective opportunity ahead.  Thank you so much.&rdquo;  Dear Friends  With Microsoft and JIO, Indian businesses can count on a partnership that will work shoulder-to-shoulder with them in their journey towards becoming digital enterprises of the future.  To further our connectivity vision of empowering digital enterprises of the future, today I want to make 2 special announcements for STARTUPS AND SMALL and MEDIUM BUSINESSES.  FIRST:  JIO is a startup built in India for India by Indians.  And we have a special place in our hearts for startups.  You may know that 80% of the cost of running a startup goes towards cloud and connectivity infrastructure.  I want to announce today that Jio is ready to take away this cost by making THE CONNECTIVITY AND CLOUD  INFRASTRUCTURE ABSOLUTELY FREE FOR BUDDING STARTUPS.  I urge all startups to register for their custom-designed package on Jio.com from 1st Jan, 2020.  JIO will also invest and financially support those startups that have the potential to address India's big needs in agriculture, healthcare, education and skill development which will boost the creation of new livelihoods.  SECOND:  Micro, small and medium businesses are the bedrock of Indian economy.  To run their business, a bundle of connectivity, productivity and automation tools costs a micro and small business between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 per month currently.  For a similar service, customers abroad pay over 1,000 Dollars per month.  Today we are taking the bold step of giving these applications along with our connectivity to small businesses for 1/10th the cost starting at Rs 1,500 per month.  Now all small business will have access to unlimited enterprise-grade voice and data services, video conferencing, security solutions, marketing and sales solutions and many more productivity tools that will help them run their business efficiently and at par with larger enterprises.  The medium and larger businesses spend even higher between ` 3 &ndash; 5 Lacs per month for which we have custom designed plans with similar value benefits.  With this step, I am certain that the two to five million micro, small and medium enterprises will propel towards prosperity and march towards creating a NEW DIGITAL INDIA.  Friends,  We are at what I call the end of the beginning of the JIO story.  We have built a robust connectivity business our first pillar with multiple growth engines that provide significant upsides.  And our second pillar digital platforms is JIO's contribution to transform India into an AI-first economy across all sectors and all walks of life.  It is my passion and conviction that New India will lead and not follow the advanced nations of the world in adopting, even creating disruptive technologies that will decide the winners and losers of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  5. Reliance Retail  Dear Shareholders,  Let me now talk about our next consumer business &ndash; the retail business.  I am proud to say that Reliance Retail has well and truly brought the Retail Revolution to India.  We are able to deliver the highest value to our customers because we have the widest geographical footprint; nationwide supply chain; technology expertise; design &amp;amp;amp; product development; and the largest assortment of goods and services.  Reliance Retail provides us with a hyper-growth platform, as the Indian consumer demands products and services which are at par with the best in the world.  It is the best proxy for the consumption story of India.  We achieved a significant milestone with our turnover crossing Rs 1,30,000 crore in the last year.  We have achieved this milestone faster than any other retail company in the world.  Our EBITDA margins are among the best globally.  The Retail business has grown phenomenally, registering a 7-fold increase in revenue and a 14-fold increase in profit in the last six years.  Our relentless focus on operating discipline has resulted in a 3-fold rise in per store productivity in the last 5 years.  We serve more than 1 lakh customers every hour, a feat no Indian retailer has been able to achieve.  Last year, we delighted over 15 crore unique customers.  We registered over 500 million footfalls last year, becoming India's preferred shopping destination.  We have expanded our footprint at a rate of 8 stores per day, opening a total of 3,000 new stores this year, higher than any other retailer globally.  Our spread of stores covers all corners of the country, with presence in nearly 7,000 towns and cities.  Over 2/3rd of our 10,415 stores are in Tier II, Tier III and Tier IV towns.  These towns are connected with a modern supply chain capable of delivering products from distribution centres spread across the country.  The unique customer insights can be leveraged to grow into a much bigger business in the next five years.  Dear Shareholders,  Here are a few more signposts of our spectacular achievements in retail.  Reliance Digital is the undisputed leader in India in consumer electronics retailing.  We sell more phones, laptops, refrigerators, TVs and ACs than any other retailer in the country.  We sold a TV every 24 seconds last year; and we sold a phone every 2 seconds.  In Grocery, we are India's largest modern trade retailer.  Reliance Retail sells nearly half of the fresh fruits and vegetables sold by the entire modern retail ecosystem in India.  We sold more than 6.4 lakh tonnes of groceries during the year.  In the fashion category, Reliance Trends is the undisputed leader.  Reliance Trends sold over four lakh garments every day last year.  With the acquisition of Hamleys, Reliance Retail has transformed into a global retailer with presence in 18 countries.  We are proud to own a global category leader in children's premium toys that we can take to other parts of the world &ndash; and we will be the first Indian company to do so.  And we continue to be the preferred partner for several international marquee brands in India.  Today, we are the only Indian retailer to be ranked in the Global 100 top retailers.  Over the next 5 years, our aim is to be amongst the world's top 20 retailers.  Dear Shareholders,  Now I want to update you on Reliance's New Commerce initiative that I spoke about last year.  New Commerce is a massive new business opportunity of USD 700 billion.  However, for Reliance, it is the greatest opportunity to promote inclusive growth and shared wealth at the bottom of India's commerce and retail pyramid.  The main purpose of New Commerce is to completely transform the unorganized retail market, which accounts for 90% of India's retail industry.  The 3 crore merchants and kirana shop owners, who generate direct and indirect livelihoods for over 20 crore people, form the backbone of India's commerce eco-system.  These highly energetic and self-motivated entrepreneurs have suffered in recent years because of their inability to invest in technology and infrastructure.  In the true Reliance ethos, we are working towards enriching and empowering them with our end-to-end digital and physical distribution stack.  For this, we are deploying blockchain, IOT, AI and other new technologies on a pan-India basis.  This tech-enabled partnership will link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands and consumers.  By removing inefficiencies and value destruction in today's market ecosystem, New Commerce will transfer significant new value to consumers, producers and merchants.  Our merchant Point of Sale (POS) Solution &ndash; Jio Prime Partner POS &ndash; is integral to our plan to create an ecosystem around small merchants.  This user friendly digital platform is designed for inventory management, customer relationship management, financial services and other services.  This will modernise even the smallest neighbourhood kirana shop to become a future-ready digitized store.  During the last year, we have made significant progress in developing and testing our merchant technology platforms.  Our beta trials with thousands of merchants across multiple locations in the country established the premise of New Commerce with significant increase in sales and improvement in margins for the participating merchants.  We are now getting ready to roll out the platform at a larger scale.  Reliance's New Commerce platform thus represents the Digital Symbiosis of Big and Small Enterprises.  I believe that the Small must not only survive, but also thrive in New India.  6. Media and Entertainment  Let me turn to our media and entertainment business.  We have created one of India's largest broadcast portfolios and digital media offerings across platforms.  Our 72 television channels reach 800 million Indians, representing more than 95% of the TV-viewing universe.  Our News18-branded TV news platform is the largest by regional footprint, ratings or revenue.  Our entertainment portfolio, led by Colors, has grown in stature, with its mass and niche offerings.  Network 18 is among the top digital media players in the country, with one in four Indians on our websites or apps, across Moneycontrol, Firstpost, Voot, News18.com and many others.  7. Reliance Foundation  Dear Shareholders,  Reliance Foundation's aim is to help change lives and empower India by providing the largest platform for development initiatives.  As the Foundation enters its 10th year, I am humbled that we have touched the lives of more than 29 million people across the country.  I would like to congratulate Nita for her leadership in building India's largest philanthropic organisation.  Through our Rural Transformation programmes, we have improved the livelihoods of over 8 million people across 19,000 villages.  Our efforts in rural India support key national priorities like ensuring water security and doubling farmers' income using technology innovations.  Last year, our Foundation provided relief and rehabilitation to people impacted by natural calamities in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.  As we speak our teams are involved in relief and rehabilitation efforts in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala.  As a mark of respect to the Pulwama martyrs, we have assumed full responsibility for the education of their children, and the livelihood of their families.  Responding to Honourable PM's appeal, we stand committed to support the people of Jammu &amp;amp;amp; Kashmir and Ladakh in all their developmental needs.  Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital continues to deliver excellent results in patient care.  Last year, clinical capabilities in newer areas were developed in collaboration with doctors from Sloan Kettering,  Gleneagles Hospital in Singapore and Guy's Hospital in London.  Innovative new programmes in liver transplant and paediatric cardiovascular surgeries were also initiated for the first time in Mumbai.  Reliance has received Letter of Intent from the Government to set up Jio Institute under the Institute of Eminence framework.  We are committed to making this a world-class institution for higher-education and research.  Our Education and Sports for All (ESA) initiatives have reached more than 18 million youth across multiple sporting disciplines.  I will also like to congratulate Nita and Akash for their leadership to Mumbai Indians, who won their fourth IPL title this year &ndash; the only team to do so.  Our Foundation aspires to make a greater impact to the nation through partnerships, digital technology and direct action.  I seek your blessings to make this happen.  8. Value Creation Roadmap  Let me now summarise the value creation roadmap for your company, as we are coming to the end of our largest capital expenditure cycle.  Your company has invested Rs 5.4 lakh crore in the last 5 years for:  1. Expanding and strengthening a world class Oil to Chemicals business which has a unique combination of scale, complexity and resilience to business cycles;  Our Oil to Chemicals business, in partnership with Saudi Aramco, is best placed to pursue growth and value creation, while adding substantial value to the feedstock provided by our strategic partner.  2. Creating the world's largest, converged, greenfield, legacy-free data network company and digital services company; Jio has grown into the proxy for tech and digital services for India.  It has strong operating leverage and is best placed to win in the emerging ` 5 lakh crore Indian digital opportunity.  3. Building the largest and fastest growing retail company in India.  Reliance Retail has created an unbeatable pole position in the US$ 80 billion organised retail market in India.  In addition, Reliance Retail has built the capabilities to address the US$ 700 billion unorganised retail opportunity, which we call New Commerce.  This is a unique business model we are building in partnership with millions of small merchants and kirana shops, so that they can be empowered to serve the Indian customers.  Together, Reliance Retail and New Commerce will become the proxy to India's consumption story.  The India-centric upstream business in partnership with BP will bring over 3 tcf of gas resources to production starting next year.  This will generate EBITDA in excess of US$ 1 billion annually for over a decade.  We also have large and valuable real estate assets; and have a strong portfolio of financial investments.  Your company has thus built a unique portfolio of world class and extremely valuable assets in the fastest growing economy in the world.  Each of our best-in-class businesses is contributing to the transformation of our country, while also creating enormous societal value.  At the end of our largest capital expenditure cycle, we continue to be rated AAA for domestic debt and two notches above Sovereign rating for international debt - the highest ratings for any industrial company in India.  Our consolidated EBITDA in the last year was ` 92,656 crore.  On the strength of our existing and new growth engines, I am very confident that we can grow this by 15% annually over the next 5 years.  Dear Shareholders,  Last year, we transferred our telecom infrastructure assets to two separate infrastructure trusts for a consideration of Rs 1.25 lakh crore with the intention of raising this money from large global institutional investors.  We have received strong interest and commitments from reputed global investors and are confident that these transactions will be completed by the end of this Financial Year.  Post this, we ended last year with net debt of Rs 154,478 crore.  We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company within the next 18 months that is by 31st March 2021.  1. Our transactions with Saudi Aramco and BP will create win-win relationships, generating significant strategic value for our partners.  We expect to complete these transactions within this financial year subject to definitive agreements, due diligence, regulatory and other customary approvals. The commitments from these two transactions are about Rs 1.1 lakh crore.  2. We have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in our consumer businesses, Jio and Reliance Retail.  We will induct leading global partners in these businesses in the next few quarters, and move towards listing of both these companies within the next five years.  3. We will also evaluate value unlocking options for our real estate and financial investments.  With these initiatives, I have no doubt that your company will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world.  As we achieve our zero net-debt target, I assure you my dear shareholders that we will reward you abundantly through higher dividends, periodic bonus issues and other means, and at a more accelerated pace than any time in our history.  9. Conclusion  Dear Shareholders,  In conclusion, I also wish to address my dear countrymen, because they are the biggest and most important stakeholders of Reliance.  My father, Dhirubhai Ambani, created Reliance because his primary motivation was to create wealth and value for India and her people.  He was absolutely clear in his vision that promoters, shareholders and employees would get their share of value only after our businesses have created maximum societal value.  This is also my vision.  And it will remain the unchanging vision of Reliance.  The trust and confidence of the people of India in Reliance is growing stronger with each passing year, because we have remained faithful to our Founder Dhurubhai's vision and core values.  This relationship of trust is our most precious asset.  A single example is enough to illustrate this truth.  In just three years, as many as 34 crore Indians have put their trust in Jio because of our uncompromising commitment to propel India to digital leadership.  Nothing gives me greater happiness than to see that Reliance is now making a bigger and more positive impact, on the lives of more Indians -- in multiple ways through business and philanthropy.  And nothing gives me greater inspiration in my work, each single day, than my conviction that the New India that our children will grow up in, will be happier, healthier, wealthier, prouder and more caring than ever before.  10. Acknowledgements  I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, lenders, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.  I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their unanimous support and immense encouragement.  I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly to create and sustain a world-class enterprise.  Thank you.

Company has invested nearly Rs 3.5 lakh crore towards creating a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure across India, with the largest optical fiber footprint.

At the AGM, Ambani said that RIL had entered into a long-term partnership with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s national petroleum company Saudi Aramco. Under the deal, Aramco would buy a 20 percent stake in RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemicals division at an enterprise value of $75 billion.  He said the deal with Aramaco, as well as the retail petroleum deal with BP will be closed within this financial year. That would bring in Rs 1.15 lakh crore into the company.

He said the group was working on a plan to list both these businesses within the next five years.  Also, there are plans on monetising the group&rsquo;s real estate assets as well financial investments.  Already, RIL has shifted around Rs 1.25 lakh crore worth of telecom assets into a separate infrastructure trust with the intention of raising money from global institutional investors. Ambani said the group has received &ldquo;strong interest and commitments&rdquo; from global investors.  He told shareholders that once the net zero debt status was achieved, they would be amply rewarded in the form of dividends and bonus share issues.&nbsp;&amp;quot;As we achieve our zero-net debt target this financial year, I assure you, my dear shareholders, that we will reward you abundantly through higher dividends, periodic bonus issues and other means, and at a more accelerated pace than any time in our history,&amp;quot; he said.

",,"Business, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance39s-refinery-complexity-index-rises-to-211_12800141.html,"The complexity of Reliance Industries' giant refinery complex at Jamnagar has risen by over 66 per cent to 21.1, giving it the ability to process a wide basket of crude oil and boosting its margins.  The company in its latest annual report said the Jamnagar supersite ranks first in the world in complexity barrels, aided by best-in-class refinery and petrochemicals integration.  Complexity index (CI) designates the capabilities of a refinery to upgrade the lowest quality crude to the highest quality refinery products, including fuels and petrochemicals.  &amp;quot;Complexity index of Jamnagar supersite, as per KBC, a global refinery consultant, has increased from earlier 12.7 to 21.1 or a 66.1 per cent boost with the start-up of Jamnagar expansion projects, including ROGC and downstream units, Paraxylene complex and Petcoke Gasification complex,&amp;quot; it said. This gives the firm an &amp;quot;ability to run a wide basket of crudes&amp;quot;.  The company has two refineries at Jamnagar -- a 33 million tonnes a year older unit that caters to the domestic market and a 35.2 million tonnes only-for-exports unit. Its total refining capacity of 68.2 million tonnes is just a shade lower than 69.2 million tonnes capacity with the country's biggest oil firm, Indian Oil Corp (IOC).  Commenting on the annual report, Morgan Stanley said the company has a vision of being one of the top five petrochemical companies in the world.  &amp;quot;RIL refinery processed about 170 different crudes, up from 150 during the past two years,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;RIL's refinery sales volume declined (to 54 per cent from 60 per cent), as domestic and captive sales increased.&amp;quot;  In 2018-19, RIL's refining margin at $9.2 per barrel remained relatively strong even in a dynamic volatile market.  &amp;quot;RIL maintained a significant premium of $4.3 a barrel over the benchmark Singapore complex margins. RIL's superior refining margins are a result of superior product slate, robust risk management, and higher secondary unit throughputs,&amp;quot; the company said in its annual report.  Among the refineries started in recent years, state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd's Bina refinery in Madhya Pradesh has CI of close to 10 while Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd's (HPCL) Bhatinda unit has a complexity of 12. IOC's latest refinery at Paradip in Odisha has a complexity factor of 12.2, making it capable of processing cheaper, higher sulphur and heavy crude.  In January 2018, RIL announced the successful commissioning of the world's first-ever Refinery Off-Gas Cracker (ROGC) complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum capacity. The ROGC complex uses off-gases from Jamnagar refineries as feedstock, helping RIL emerge as one of the most efficient producers of polymers in the world.  Petcoke gasification project, one of the largest clean initiatives in the world, uniquely turned Jamnagar refineries 'bottom-less' by converting low-value petroleum coke into syngas (synthesis gas).  &amp;quot;One of the most complex projects, it has integrated 83 process units with refineries and other downstream units operating in extreme conditions, with temperatures ranging from (-)190&deg;C to (+)1,480&deg;C, and pressure fluctuating from vacuum to 120 standard atmosphere,&amp;quot; the annual report said.  Reliance's refining complex, which is the largest in the world, is designed to operate solely on desalinated seawater, thus making freshwater resources from lakes and rivers available for communities to use.

Gross refining margin (GRM) at $8.1 per barrel was a miss on street expectations.  Jio continues to meet expectations in terms of its quarterly performance. Despite slower pace of customer addition, strong competition and falling average revenue per user (ARPU), it maintained its operating margin in Q1 FY20. Brookfield's investment remains the key highlight, which would enable lowering debt.  Retail business came out with strong performance and growth in revenue as well as margins. The segment's increasing contribution to the overall profits is noteworthy.      Key Positives  -Reliance Retail reported a stellar 47.5 percent growth YoY (year-on-year) in its top-line. This was largely led by 265 new stores during the quarter. Operational efficiencies led to margins improving by 60 basis points YoY. In core retail (excluding petro retail and Jio stores), the margin was 8.9 percent.  -Jio witnessed 5.16 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in its net revenue which was at Rs 11,679 crore. Growth returned on the back of net addition of 24.5 million subscribers in the quarter. Jio's subscriber-base stood at 331.3 million.  -What came as a surprise was Jio's 114 bps expansion in its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin on QoQ basis.    -The refining and marketing business saw a decent uptick in revenue driven largely by higher throughput. Improvement in gasoline margins was a positive surprise for the segment. Margins in diesel and airline fuel remained largely flat.  Key negative  -While Jio's subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of growth moderated primarily due to base effect and increased competition.  -Strong competition and offers by Jio led to ARPU decline of 3.3 percent on QoQ basis and came at Rs 122 per month.  -GRM at $8.1 per barrel was lower than last quarter as well as the street&rsquo;s expectation. However it was in line with the global weakness in refinance margins and the challenging global environment for the segment.    -Performance of the petchem segment remained under pressure, with dip in revenue due to decline in volumes. Lower Price realisations in Paraxylene and dip in margins in polyethylene negatively impacted the segment&rsquo;s profits.  Outlook  Results were broadly in line with our expectations barring the weakness in the petchem and refining performance. However, we take a cue from the CFO's comments that segmental margins and product cracks are already on a rebound which should help improve performance in the upcoming quarters. Singapore benchmark GRMs in the current month have seen an uptick.  Jio continues to be core focus for expansion and is expected to drive the revenue growth in the coming quarters. We believe Jio would continue its strong show, going forward, on the back of its strategy of deeper and wider market penetration that would continue to disrupt the entire value chain. Further, Jio continues to build capacity in line with increasing data traffic which crossed the 10 Exabyte mark during the quarter. Additionally, its JioGigaFiber services is in its final stages, and early signs have been very encouraging. The company is gradually rolling out enterprise services as well.  An agreement has been entered into with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its affiliates for an investment of Rs 25,215 crore into Tower InvIT. This will be used to repay existing financial liabilities of Jio.  We expect the Brick-and-mortar store expansion to continue across all verticals. Impetus is expected to be laid on tier 3 and 4 regions, where the headroom for growth is huge. Nevertheless, on an already high base, revenue growth may moderate from a quarter-on-quarter perspective. A formal announcement pertaining to the launch of an all-encompassing e-commerce platform is awaited.  We remain optimistic about the retail vertical's revenue growth potential on the back of a large store network pan-India, growing footfalls, adequate warehousing facilities and presence across diversified product categories. However, it&rsquo;ll be important to keep an eye on how the margin trajectory would pan out. This would be predominantly dependent on benefits of scale in terms of availability of wide assortments, product launches, promotions, and merchandise sourcing.    It is also noteworthy that the company is steadily transforming from a commodity driven business to a more consumer oriented business with increasing contribution of the consumer segments in its EBITDA.&nbsp; The contribution of Reliance Retail to Reliance Industries&rsquo; consolidated revenue and EBIT has been steadily increasing.    We believe this would be value accretive in times to come. Initiatives to reduce leverage is also positive for long term.

The refining &amp;amp;amp; petrochemical volumes, and Jio &amp;amp;amp; retail businesses are expected to be strong and will drive revenue growth on a sequential basis for the company.  However, there could be some pressure on consolidated margin from Jio &amp;amp;amp; petchem segments, which may impact profitability a bit in Q1 but standalone operating income is likely to see sequential increase on higher refining margin, crude throughput and petchem volumes, brokerages feel.  Gross refining margin is expected to be higher at $8.5 a barrel in Q1FY20 against $8.2 a barrel in Q4FY19, which implies a premium of $5 per barrel over Singapore GRM, said Motilal Oswal. It expects refining throughput to grow 9 percent QoQ and petchem volume to rise 11 percent QoQ but petrochemical segment is expected to suffer due to reduced product margins.  &amp;quot;With core business bearing the periodic suffering, positive developments in the telecom and retail segments should drive growth further for the company,&amp;quot; the brokerage said.  Singapore GRM for the quarter stood at $3.5 par barrel, down around 42 percent YoY and up around 8 percent QoQ, due to an improvement in gasoline cracks.  &amp;quot;We expect RIL to report a marginal QoQ increase in standalone EBITDA led by modestly higher refining margins at $8.5 a barrel and increase in crude throughput and petchem volumes, which will be partly offset by moderation in overall petchem margins,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  The brokerage expects consolidated EBITDA to decline QoQ, as higher standalone and retail EBITDA will be offset by lower Jio EBITDA due to accounting of capacity cost pertaining to Jio's fiber/tower InvITs in lieu of interest and depreciation cost earlier.  Reliance management is confident of 7 percent volume growth in both polymer and polyester business, which will benefit Reliance in Indian markets, hence petrochemicals business is expected to remain buoyant in Q1 FY20, Narnolia said.  The brokerage also added that Jio has successfully integrated Hathway and Den network and is now rolling out JioGiga Fiber in 1,100 cities in India targeting 5 crore JioGiga Homes in the first phase.  Key issues to watch out for would be GRM, petrochemical margin, telecom subscribers, future capex, and interest cost &amp;amp;amp; depreciation.  Reliance Retail has added 510 stores during Q4FY19 and 2,829 stores during the FY19. &amp;quot;Further the company is adding 120 new outlets every quarter which gives us strong revenue growth visibility for next couple of years. Retail being the high margin business is expected to contribute significantly in operating profits of the company,&amp;quot; Narnolia said.  Jio has added 307 million subscribers to its network by the end of March 2019. Company&rsquo;s aggressive efforts to increase subscriber base restricts ARPU to Rs 126 in March quarter.

BP's Chief Executive (Upstream) Bernard Looney said the partners are also discussing the development of natural gas found in Mahanadi basin, off the Odisha coast.  &amp;quot;Together we are spending up to $5 billion or Rs 35,000 crore in three gas development projects in the KG-D6 block and together we are expected to bring about one billion cubic feet per day of new domestic gas on stream by 2022,&amp;quot; he said here.  The three projects will help reverse the falling gas output from what was once the biggest gas-producing block in the country.  Last month, the two partners had announced investment sanction for development of their deepest natural gas discovery in the KG-D6 block. The MJ, or D-55, gas find will be developed in sync with the previously approved 'R-Series' and the Satellites Cluster development to add 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas production in phases.  The two partners also exploring ways of &amp;quot;economically&amp;quot; developing discoveries in the NEC-25 block in the Mahanadi basin and building pipelines for transportation of the gas, Looney said.  The three projects will develop a total of about 3 Tcf (trillion cubic feet) of discovered gas resources. R-Cluster will be first to come on stream, delivering gas in the second half of 2020-21 fiscal. The second set is called the Satellite Cluster. MJ is the third of these fields.  Reliance, which is the operator of KG-D6 with 60 per cent stake, has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3) -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.  The output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.3 mmscmd in the January-March quarter. MA field ceased to produce last year.  BP holds 30 per cent stake in the block while the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources of Canada.  Besides MJ, four deepsea satellite gas discoveries -- D-2, 6, 19 and 22 -- are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block. These six fields are called Satellite development.  The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find.  According to Looney, India is expected to overtake China as the largest growth market for energy in the mid-2020s and its primary energy demand will increase two-and-a-half times until 2040.  &amp;quot;India has a natural gas base with a potential to meet 50 per cent of anticipated demand for gas through to 2050. Natural gas burns at half of the emission of coal for power generation and offers significant benefits for air quality. In renewables, there are large untapped solar and wind resources with a potential to be utilised at a cost which is increasingly competitive with hydrocarbons,&amp;quot; he said.

",,"Business, Market news, R-Cluster development, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance-to-start-gas-productionr-cluster2nd-halffy21_12398561.html,"Reliance Industries has stated that it will start natural gas production from R-Cluster gas field in the flagging KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal from the second half of the 2020-21 fiscal.  Reliance and its partner BP Plc of UK had in June 2017 announced an investment of Rs 40,000 crore in the three sets of discoveries to reverse the flagging production in KG-D6 block. These finds were expected to bring a total 30-35 million cubic metres (1 billion cubic feet) of gas a day onstream, phased over 2020-22.  R-Cluster will be first to come on stream.  &amp;quot;R-Cluster development is on track for first gas in 2H FY21,&amp;quot; Reliance said in an investor presentation after its fourth-quarter earnings.  Four of the planned six wells that would produce gas from the field have been completed and the fifth one is being drilled currently, it said adding first offshore installation campaign is underway and is expected to be completed in Q1 FY20.  The second set is called the Satellite Cluster for which all major orders have been committed and engineering work is in progress. &amp;quot;Manufacturing of components of Subsea Production System (SPS) has commenced,&amp;quot; it said.  For MJ, the third of these fields, bids for major long lead items such as drilling tangibles and FPSO is underway, Reliance said adding a rig has already been committed for drilling of wells on the field.  Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA - the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.  The output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic metres per day in March 2010 to 1.8 mmscmd in the January-March quarter, the presentation said.  MA field ceased to produce last year.  &amp;quot;Currently, D1-D3 field is producing and all efforts are being made to extend the life of the field,&amp;quot; the company said in the presentation.  Reliance is the operator of the block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.  MJ gas find is located about 2,000 metres directly below the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields in the KG-D6 block and is estimated to hold a minimum of 0.988 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of contingent resource.  Besides MJ-1, four deepsea satellite gas discoveries -- D-2, 6, 19 and 22 -- are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block.  The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find.  The government had in 2012 approved a $1.529 billion plan to produce 10.36 mmscmd of gas from four satellite fields of block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) by 2016-17. The four fields have 617 billion cubic feet of reserves and can produce gas for eight years.  However, the companies did not begin the investment citing uncertainty over gas pricing.  After the government allowed a higher gas price for yet-to-be-developed gas finds in difficult areas like the deep sea, RIL and BP decided to take up their development.  RIL-BP have kept the $3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, which was approved in August 2013. About 12.9 mmscmd of gas for 13 years can be produced from D-34 discovery, which is estimated to hold recoverable reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet.  Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.

GRMs contracted in line with global weakness; maintained better premium vs. regional benchmark.  Jio maintained operating margin despite slowdown in customer additions and ARPU.  Retail displayed a better set of operating margins.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Reliance Industries (RIL) reported a mixed set of numbers wherein traditional businesses (petchem and refining) were weak, but largely in line with global trends. The consumer businesses were the saviour. Margins in retail improved and Jio&rsquo;s quarterly performance remains robust. Despite the slower pace of customer addition, strong competition and falling ARPU (average revenue per user), Jio maintained its operating margin in Q4 FY19.      Key Positives:  Retail sales (19 percent of overall) surged 51.6 percent YoY primarily on the account of store additions. Sequentially, sales growth had moderated to 3.1 percent QoQ. A key highlight of the result has been margin improvement in retail business to 4.7 percent in Q4 (vs. 3 percent in FY18) on account of operating leverage.  Pls also read: Reliance Retail could be worth Rs 3.75 lakh crore, or half of RIL's mcap  Jio (part of digital services; 7 percent of sales) witnessed a 7 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in its net revenue to Rs 11,106 crore. The growth was driven by the net addition of 26.6 million subscribers during the quarter. With this, Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base has expanded to 306.7 million.  Despite strong competition and offers by Jio, ARPU dipped 2.9 percent QoQ to Rs 126.2 per month. Jio maintained its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin at 39 percent on a QoQ basis.    Key Negatives  Traditional businesses, particularly refining (46 percent of overall), witnessed a weak set of numbers that reflect global trends. The segment posted sharp decline in revenues sequentially due to a planned shutdown. Further, weak product cracks adversely impacted GRMs. While GRM was better than the regional metric (Singapore GRM -$5/bbl), premium tapered off in Q4.   Further, petrochemicals business (22 percent of overall) sequential performance was a disappointment. However, it witnessed a 11.3 percent improvement in sales due to better pricing and realizations for PTA (Purified terephthalic acid), Paraxylene and Polypropylene. This helped in partially offsetting the weakness in other petrochemicals which were weighed down by the higher supplies from new US capacities.  While Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of the growth moderated primarily due to base effect and increased competition. Interest cost outlay increased by 18.6 percent leading to a flat growth in profit-after-tax (PAT), lower than the 18.6 percent QoQ growth in EBITDA.  Key observation: Armaco &amp;amp;amp; RIL &ndash; Tale of two transitions  While there was no official comment on the media report that Armaco is interested in 25 percent stake in refining and petrochemical business, such a possibility cannot be ruled out.  Armaco has been looking for strengthening its presence in the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas downstream businesses in recent times. Earlier this week, Armaco bought a minority stake (17 percent worth $1.2 billion in the Hyundai&rsquo;s oil refining unit in Korea.) Last month, Armaco bought a 70 percent stake for roughly $69 billion in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s petro-chem giant &ndash; SABIC. In India itself Saudi Aramco is working with other OMCs to develop a mega refinery complex in Maharashtra. A possible investment in RIL&rsquo;s refining business could be a step towards further diversification making it a conglomerate having multi continent presence.  For RIL, this step can possibly mean refueling itself with ammunition to take on competition in the retail, telecom and digital businesses. Remember, RIL&rsquo;s foray in recent years has been in territories dominated by global giants - Amazon, Walmart, Netflix and Alibaba.&nbsp; As the peers have strong insights and investment appetite for reach and content, there might be greater need for investments particularly when the confluence of telecom, communication and entertainment intensifies.  Outlook:  Results were broadly as per our expectation barring the performance of refining. However, we take our cue from the CFO&rsquo;s comments that segmental margins and product cracks are already on a rebound.  Jio continues to be core focus for expansion and is expected to drive the revenue growth in the coming quarters. We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of its strategy of deeper and wider market penetration (with over 1 million retailers for customer acquisition and selling prepaid recharges) that would continue to disrupt the entire value chain. The company is also making further inroads through various strategic tie-ups and partnerships (Disney, DEN, and Hathaway) and roll-out of new services (JioGigaFiber) in 1,600 cities.  Further we view the growing contribution of Reliance Retail and Jio at the EBITDA level&nbsp;as transformational. Currently both these segments contribute nearly 25 percent of EBITDA, which was 13 percent a year back and hardly 2 percent in 2015.  At a strategic level, business transition from a low multiple commodity business to consumer oriented business should be value accretive. So far, this move has been funded through debt and cash flows from traditional business. The competitive landscape may make it imperative to look for other avenues of funding to grow these businesses. However, it is noteworthy that company&rsquo;s recent attempts to manage debt levels have helped in keeping debt to equity metric at a comfortable level of 0.67x.    A back of the envelope check on the SOTP (sum of the parts) valuation suggest that even at a conservative multiples medium term growth potential is not fully priced in.

Q4&nbsp;revenue from the petrochemicals segment increased 11.3% YoY to Rs 42,414 crore ($6.1 billion) mainly due to the increase in price realizations and volumes in PTA, PP, and Paraxylene.  Petrochemicals segment EBIT came in at Rs 7,975 crore, up 23.9% YoY as compared to Rs 6,435 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

However, weak refining segment, lower throughput and stronger rupee may drag standalone earnings.  &amp;quot;We model RIL's consolidated net income to increase modestly by 1 percent QoQ to Rs 10,340 crore (EPS of Rs 17.4) in Q4FY19 led by an increase in EBITDA from Jio and retail, which will offset lower standalone contribution,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  On a consolidated basis, Motilal Oswal expects Reliance to report 6 percent sequential growth in Q4 profit.  In case of standalone business, Kotak expects RIL to report 3 percent QoQ decline in net income at Rs 8,620 crore dragged by sharply lower refining margins, which will be partly mitigated by improvement in LLDPE, PVC and polyester margins.  Prabhudas Lilladher also expects standalone profit to fall 5 percent QoQ.  The&nbsp;gross refining margins (GRMs) for the quarter ended March 2019&nbsp;are expected to decline due to sharp fall in spreads for gasoline &amp;amp;amp; diesel, refinery shutdown (108 percent utilisation) and lower light-heavy crude differentials.  According to Motilal Oswal, refining throughput may decline 7 percent and gross refining margin may fall to $8 a barrel against $8.8 a barrel in Q3FY19.  Emkay expects RIL's GRM to be $8.2 a barrel, down 7 percent QoQ, while petchem earnings should see a 4-5 percent fall QoQ on weaker margins.  Key segments, which expect to drive growth for the company, are retail and telecom.  &amp;quot;Earnings of Retail and Jio should continue to grow at 8-10 percent QoQ.

In a statement, RIL said its Singapore-incorporated subsidiary Reliance Ethane Holding Pte Ltd (REHPL) has signed &amp;quot;binding definitive agreements for a strategic investment by MOL&amp;quot; and an unnamed strategic minority investor in six limited liability companies.  REHPL owns these six limited liability companies which are special purpose vehicles that own the Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs).  It did not give financial details of the deal.  &amp;quot;Transaction closing is subject to regulatory approvals. Post-closing, SPVs shall be jointly controlled by REHPL and MOL,&amp;quot; the statement said.  Reliance imports some 1.6 million tonne of ethane from the US to replace natural gas and naphtha as feedstock at its petrochemical plants in western India.  Use of ethane, a natural gas component that is produced in large volumes in North America after the shale gas revolution, has reduced the company's petrochemicals feedstock cost by about 30 per cent.  It in 2017 began receiving consignment or cargo of ethane from the US. VLECs are used to transport liquefied ethane from the US to the Gujarat Chemical Port Terminal Company at Dahej in Gujarat.  Reliance, which used 2.5 million tonne a year of naphtha as feedstock in petrochemical crackers, has contracted ethane supplies for more than 20 years from the US. Ethane reduced naphtha usage by 5,00,000 tonne.  Ethane is used as feedstock in the company's crackers in Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat and Nagothane in Maharashtra.  Reliance had in 2014 ordered building of six VLECs at Samsung Heavy Industries' shipyards in Korea. Japan's biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines will manage and operate the ships for RIL.  &amp;quot;Given MOL is currently the operator of all the six VLECs, investment by MOL will deepen our relationship with them and ensure continued safe and efficient operations of the VLECs.  &amp;quot;We welcome MOL as a strategic partner into the SPVs as they move beyond the current operator role to the joint owner and operator role in the SPVs,&amp;quot; P M S Prasad, Executive Director, RIL, said.  Takeshi Hashimoto, Member of the Board, Executive Vice President, MOL said, the investment would enable MOL to add six unique VLECs, which the company has been operating for some time now, as owners to its existing fleet of over 850 vessels.  These vessels include LNG carrier, other tankers, dry bulkers, car carriers, ferries, and coastal RoRo ships and cruise ships, Hashimoto added.  &amp;quot;MOL has detailed knowledge about these assets having supervised the construction and delivery of the six VLECs and subsequently operating them since their delivery. We are therefore happy and look forward to using this strategic opportunity to be a joint owner and to significantly strengthen our existing relationship with Reliance,&amp;quot; he said.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

If the deal goes through, Reliance Retail plans to increase the geographic footprint of Hamleys in India.",,"Business, Companies, Hamleys, Reliance Industries, RIL, video",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/in-play-reliance-retailtalks-to-buy-out-259-year-old-british-toymaker-hamleys_12387721.html,"Ashwin Mohan Moneycontrol News  Hamleys, the iconic British toy retailer which has been around since the time the East India Company established its foothold in the country, could soon fall into Indian hands. If talks with the Chinese owner succeed, the 259-year-old brand will end up being the plaything of Reliance Retail, India&rsquo;s largest retailer, multiple sources involved in the negotiations told Moneycontrol News.  The purchase of Hamleys, which has its flagship store on London&rsquo;s Regent Street, will illustrate the growing international ambition of Reliance Retail, which has a target of growing at 30% every year for a decade.  Reliance Retail is owned by Reliance Industries Ltd, India&rsquo;s largest company by market value. The Network 18 group, the publisher of Moneycontrol, is controlled by RIL  &amp;quot;Due diligence for the deal is at an advanced stage,&amp;quot; said one of the sources cited above, adding, &amp;quot;Reliance Retail is aggressively pursuing the deal.&amp;quot;  Hamleys, which began life as &lsquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark in London in 1760, counts the royal family of Saudi Arabia among its loyal customers. In recent years, though, it has been struggling due to uncertainty over Brexit and softening UK consumer confidence. It reported a loss of 12 million pounds in 2017 and a 2.5 percent decline in annual revenues to 66.3 million pounds. However, it is still a dominant player in the $11 billion worldwide toy industry even as rivals like Target, Walmart, Amazon and Kohl&rsquo;s are snapping at its heels.  A source said the acquisition, if successful, will help expand Reliance Retail&rsquo;s portfolio. &ldquo;Reliance (Retail) can scale up Hamley&rsquo;s business with its capabilities in supply chain management and strong distribution network.&rdquo;  Responding to an e-mail query from Moneycontrol, a Reliance Industries spokesperson said, &amp;quot;As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours. Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. We have made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance with our obligations under SEBI regulations and our agreements with the stock exchanges.&amp;quot;  Moneycontrol is awaiting an email response from C. Banner International, the promoter of Hamleys, and will update this article as soon as it gets it.  Reliance Retail already has a pan-India franchise agreement with Hamleys to merchandise its famous toys. Hamleys has around 129 stores globally, a large majority of which are under the franchise model and outside the United Kingdom, the company is present in China, Germany, Russia, India, South Africa, the Middle East and other regions.  If the deal goes through, Reliance Retail plans to increase the geographic footprint of Hamleys in India.  &amp;quot;Hamleys currently has around 50 stories in India, the plan is to ramp it up to 200 over the next three years,&amp;quot; said another source familiar with the deal.  Moneycontrol could not independently verify if there were other bidders as well for Hamley&rsquo;s.  According to a report by market research firm IMARC, the Indian toy market was worth $1.5 billion in 2018, and has grown 15.9 percent compounded annually, between 2011 and 2018. IMARC expects the market size to cross $3.3 billion by 2024, driven by a huge base of young population, and strong economic growth. The report lists Funskool, Lego, Mattel and Hasbro as the main players in the Indian toy market.  Chinese fashion conglomerate C. Banner International had acquired Hamleys for &pound;100 million in cash in 2015. Last year in October, C Banner started looking out for potential buyers for the toy maker, according to a Sky News report. Corporate finance firm Vermillion Partners was hired to negotiate with bidders, the report said.  If the deal with Reliance Retail goes through, it would be the fourth time Hamleys has changed hands since it was taken private by an Icelandic investor in 2003.  Reliance Retail has entered into tie-ups with many other marque international brands such as Diesel, Marks &amp;amp;amp; Spencers, Steve Madden and Kenneth Cole. It reported a turnover of Rs 69,198 crore for the financial year 2017-18. As on 31st December 2018, Reliance Retail operated 9,907 stores across 6400+cities with a retail area of over 21 million square feet. Earlier in January 2019, global brokerage house CLSA said the organised and combined online and the offline retail market may grow ninefold to $550 billion in 10 years and RIL's pure retail revenues may rise nearly 12-fold to $138 billion in the same period.

In some instances, an entity/businessman stepped in as a white knight and saved the target company from a hostile takeover.  Here we revisit some of those tales of India Inc.  -In 2010, Reliance Industries turned white knight for Prithvi Raj Singh Oberoi's EIH Ltd&nbsp;as Mukesh Ambani helped the company fight off a potential takeover bid by consumer goods company ITC. Ambani had picked up a 14.12 percent stake in the hotel business.  ITC had amassed close to 14.98 percent stake in the company over the years. However, it had said it would never make a hostile bid to take control of EIH. The transaction with RIL gave Oberoi enough funds to shore up a defence.  -In 2000, promoters of real estate company Gesco Corporation were facing a hostile bid by Delhi-based Abhishek Dalmia's Renaissance Estates.&nbsp;It&nbsp;bought 10 percent stake in Gesco with a low share price and launched an open offer for an additional 45 percent.  The promoters approached Mahindra Realty &amp;amp;amp; Infrastructure, who made a counter-offer for 33.5 percent of Gesco. Dalmia ultimately sold its 10.5 percent stake to the new combine of Gesco-Mahindra at a huge profit.  -In 2001, Radhakishan Damani made a hostile bid for British American Tobacco (BAT)'s VST Industries. Damani had acquired below 15 percent stake in the company. He now wanted another 20 percent stake in the company at Rs 112 per share, which was a 26 percent premium to the market price. However, cigarette company ITC stepped in as the white knight and gave a counter-offer of Rs 115 per share that went up to Rs 126 per share later.  -Pharmaceutical company Solrex had tried to make a hostile bid for K Raghavendra Rao's Orchid Chemicals &amp;amp;amp; Pharmaceuticals. It had acquired 12 percent in the company. However, Rao resisted the bid and got the support from the company's large institutional investors, which collectively held 38 percent in the company. These included Life Insurance Corporation and United Insurance Company, Macquaire Bank and Harpline.  -In 2000, Kolkata-based Arun Bajoria bought a 15 percent stake in Wadia Group's Bombay Dyeing. He threatened to make an open offer to the shareholders of the company. The Wadias turned to Ratan Tata and Keshub Mahindra to help prevent a takeover. Bajoria finally sold his shares to the Wadias for a huge profit.  -In 2007, Harish Bhasin's investment firm HB Stockholding announced an open offer to acquire 22.8 percent of DCM Shriram Industries. The firm already held a 12.87 percent stake in the company. However, promoters countered the move by issuing warrants to themselves and increased their stake.

Reliance had been supplying alkylate, diluent naphtha and other fuel to Venezuela through its U.S.-based subsidiary before Washington in late January imposed sanctions aimed at curbing the OPEC member's oil exports and ousting Socialist President Nicolas Maduro.  At least three vessels chartered by the Indian conglomerate supplied refined products to Venezuela in recent weeks, and another vessel carrying gasoil is expected to set sail to the South American nation as well, according to the sources and data.  A Reliance spokesman wrote to Reuters in an email and said: &amp;quot;Reliance is and will remain in compliance with the sanctions and shall work with the concerned authorities.&amp;quot;  He also said &amp;quot;the volume of products supplied to and crude oil imported from Venezuela have not increased.&amp;quot;  Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates subsidiaries linked to its oil and telecom businesses, among others.  The Indian market is crucial for Venezuela's economy because it has historically been the second-largest cash-paying customer for the OPEC country's crude, behind the United States.  Additional sanctions against Venezuela are possible in the future, as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has not yet tried to prevent companies based outside the United States from buying Venezuelan oil, a strategy known as &amp;quot;secondary sanctions.&amp;quot;  Refinitiv Eikon trade data shows that Reliance shipped alkylate, a component for motor gasoline, to Venezuela on vessels Torm Mary and Torm Anabel in recent weeks. Those originated in India and passed through the Suez Canal.  It also shipped a gasoline cargo using tanker Torm Troilus to Venezuela and is preparing to send 35,000 tonnes of gasoil in a vessel called Vukovar to the South American nation.  &amp;quot;Reliance is also supplying some products from its Rotterdam storage,&amp;quot; a source familiar with Reliance's operation said.  PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.  In a statement last week, Reliance said its U.S. unit has completely stopped all business with PDVSA. Reliance also halted all supply of diluents including heavy naphtha to Venezuela and does not plan to resume such sales until sanctions are lifted, according to the release.  Venezuela has overall imported some 160,000 barrels per day of fuel and diluents for its extra heavy oil output since the U.S. measures were imposed, according to PDVSA and Refinitiv data, below levels prior to the sanctions but still enough to supply gas stations and power plants.  Reliance is among the biggest buyers of Venezuelan oil, although the company has recently said it has not increased crude purchases from Venezuela. In 2012, Reliance signed a 15-year deal to buy between 300,000 to 400,000 bpd of heavy crude from PDVSA.  Ship tracking data obtained by Reuters showed that Reliance's average purchases from Venezuela were less than 300,000 bpd in 2018 and in the first two months of this year.  Venezuela continues to supply at least some oil to India. A very large crude carrier (VLCC) is anchored off Venezuela's Jose port waiting to load oil bound for India, and at least six other vessels of the same size are underway to India's Sikka and Vadinar ports, according to the Refinitiv data.  PDVSA's second-largest customer in India is Nayara Energy, partially owned by Russian energy firm Rosneft, one of PDVSA's primary allies.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

In February, the Supreme Court had ordered Anil Ambani and two directors of Reliance Communications (RCom)&mdash;the company headed by Anil--to pay Ericsson Rs 453 crore within four weeks or face a three-month jail term for contempt of court.  Earlier on March 18, Ericsson said it had received Rs 462 crore from RCom.  In a statement, RCom Chairman Anil Ambani said, &ldquo;My sincere and heartfelt thanks to my respected elder brother, Mukesh, and Nita, for standing by me during these trying times and demonstrating the importance of staying true to our strong family values by extending this timely support. I and my family are grateful we have moved beyond the past, and are deeply touched with this gesture.&rdquo;  In effect, this is the second occasion that Mukesh Ambani has come to the rescue of his brother after a public feud in 2005 which eventually culminated in the assets of the Reliance group being split among the two siblings.  In 2018, Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio Infocomm offered to buy RCom&rsquo;s wireless assets for Rs 3,000 crore, indicating that the brothers had buried their differences.  RCom, which owed around Rs 571 crore to Ericsson, including a one-time settlement of Rs 550 crore plus interest, had already deposited Rs 118 crore with the Supreme Court in February. Ericsson, which managed and operated&nbsp;RCom's network under a 2014 deal, last year approached the court over the unpaid dues.  Anil Ambani had given a personal guarantee to the Supreme Court last year, promising that Ericsson&rsquo;s dues would be cleared. However, Reliance Communications missed the first deadline of September 30. Ericsson then filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court against Anil Ambani in October. The court gave RCom time till December 15 to make the payment. RCom filed a plea for an extension of the deadline, but the court dismissed it. RCom failed to honour the second deadline as well, following which Ericsson again filed a contempt petition.

China's move to put a technical hold on the proposal was despite the terrorist outfit claiming responsibility for&nbsp;Pulwama terror attack where 40 CRPF jawans&nbsp;were killed. Angry Indians took to Twitter to talk about China's absolute lack of empathy and disregard for India's safety using the hashtag &mdash;&nbsp;#BoycottChineseProducts.  Read:&nbsp;#BoycottChineseProducts trends on Twitter as China blocks UN move to list Masood Azhar global terrorist  While a number of social media users agree that boycotting Chinese goods would be the best way to send across a message to China, what will be the impact of&nbsp;an Indian boycott of Chinese goods?  In 2017, the India-China bilateral trade reached a historic high of $84.44 billion, up 18 percent year-on-year (YoY), according to World Integrated Trade Solution data. This was notwithstanding bilateral tensions over a host of issues including the Doklam standoff, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and Beijing blocking India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).  While bilateral trade reached a new landmark, the trade deficit continues to remain high.&nbsp;India's trade deficit with China was a huge $63 billion in 2017-18, which was more than a third of the country's total trade deficit, according to&nbsp;Commerce&nbsp;Ministry data. The country's exports to China stood at $13.3 billion and imports from the country at $76.38 billion in 2017-18.  Read:&nbsp;India-China bilateral trade hits historic high of $84 bn in 2017  In 2017,&nbsp;India's trade deficit with China was $51.75 billion, registering a growth of 8.55 percent YoY.  Acknowledging the need to take steps to check the deficit, China signed three export protocols &mdash; on rice, fishmeal and tobacco &mdash; to allow imports of the three items.  If India chooses to boycott Chinese products, it may affect the imports of capital goods, machinery and electrical, chemicals, as well as intermediate and consumer goods. These imports are important for industries in India to manufacture goods, medicines as well as gadgets.    &amp;quot;India is considerable dependent on China for many of the finished products such as gadgets. If India boycotts Chinese products, it will considerably impact the country,&amp;quot; said Biswajit Dhar, Professor and Head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.  With raw materials being exported to China, the neighbouring country is able to manufacture and export its goods at such low prices owing to subsidies and support from the government. Boycotting Chinese goods would mean fewer cheap goods for consumers in India. A reduction in the imports of cheaper capital goods would also push up production costs, making products costlier, thereby, affecting the consumers.  Since India also imports a high&nbsp;number of electrical products, it would impact the prices of electrical gadgets and smartphones.&nbsp;Chinese companies such as Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus nearly control&nbsp;51 percent of India's over $8&nbsp;billion smartphone market.  Even in the power sector, India is heavily dependent on China when it comes to achieving its renewable energy target.&nbsp;India's import dependence for meeting its solar equipment demand was&nbsp;over 90 percent in past three financial years, Power and New &amp;amp;amp; Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha last year. A majority of these imports were from China.  The value of solar cells/photovoltaic cells whether or not assembled in module/panel, imported from China jumped to $3.41 billion in 2017-18 from $596.73 million in 2013-14, the minister informed.  In 2018-19, China supplied&nbsp;over 80 percent of the antibiotics imported by India and well above 60 percent of electronic products and components. Thus, some of the key sectors of the Indian economy are critically dependent on China.  Even though the percentage of imports from India to China remains low, it would impact China in the long run.&nbsp;In&nbsp;2017, India became the 24th largest exporter to China. If India chooses to boycott, it would impact China's entry into a large market such as India, but the intensity of impact would be felt more at home.  &amp;quot;If India decides to boycott Chinese products, it will not make any economic sense given the kind of dependency that we have,&amp;quot; Dhar said.  Latest trade data, however, shows that India's bilateral trade deficit with China has shrunk this year, according to a report by The Hindu BusinessLine. In the first nine months of 2018-19, India's exports to China have grown by an impressive 34 percent (as against less than 10 percent overall), while imports from its northern neighbour have declined by nearly 4.5 percent (as against an increase of 14 percent overall).  The decline was mostly due to the increased exports of petroleum products to&nbsp;China.&nbsp;Reliance Industries' aromatic production capacities over the past couple of years&nbsp;have found its way into the export market with China emerging as one of the major destinations, according to the report.  Even though it may indicate a reversal in the rising trend in the trade deficit,&nbsp;there remains a significant area of concern - the absence of&nbsp;adequate manufacturing facilities.  A number of these sectors would be affected if India decides to boycott Chinese products. To be able to boycott Chinese goods, India&nbsp;needs to reduce its trade deficit with China and strengthen its manufacturing sector to be able to produce goods back home, providing cheaper products to customers.

Washington is preparing to impose &amp;quot;very significant&amp;quot; Venezuela-related sanctions against financial institutions in the coming days, US special envoy Elliott Abrams said.  PDVSA was importing about 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of naphtha, mostly from the United States, to dilute up to 400,000 bpd of extra heavy oil and make it exportable.  Reliance's Houston-based subsidiary was supplying diluents to Venezuela.  Reliance, led by Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others.  Reliance has not increased oil purchases from Venezuela, the company said in response to a Reuters email seeking comment.  In 2012 Reliance, Venezuela's key oil client, signed a 15-year deal to buy between 300,000-400,000 bpd of heavy oil from PDVSA.  Ship tracking data obtained by Reuters showed that Reliance averages purchase from Venezuela were below 300,000 bpd in 2018 and in January this year.  &amp;quot;Our US subsidiary has completely stopped all business with Venezuela's state-owned oil company, PDVSA, and its global parent has not increased crude purchases,&amp;quot; it said.  The administration of US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping sanctions on PDVSA in January, aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member's crude exports to the United States to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down.  &amp;quot;Since the U.S. government imposed sanctions on the government of Venezuela in late January 2019, Reliance Industries Ltd has been in close contact with representatives from the US State Department to ensure full compliance,&amp;quot; Reliance said.  The Indian market is crucial for Venezuela's economy because it has historically been the second-largest cash-paying customer for the OPEC country's crude, behind the United States.  &amp;quot;We will continue a constructive dialogue with the U.S. government to ensure Reliance remains in compliance,&amp;quot; it said.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale on Monday and discussed India's purchases of oil from the Maduro-led government.  &amp;quot;We are asking the same thing of India as we are of every country: do not be the economic lifeline for the Maduro regime,&amp;quot; Pompeo said.

In its final tariff order, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) in a March 12 order said transporting natural gas on the East-West pipeline would cost Rs 71.66 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) on gross calorific value (GCV) basis from April 1 as compared to Rs 52.33 per mmBtu tariff charged for April 1, 2009, to March 31, 2019, period.  The tariff approved is almost half of the tariff sought by East West Pipeline Ltd - the operator of the pipeline. It had sought the tariff to be raised to Rs 151.84 per mmBtu with effect from April 1, 2018.  A rise in tariff would lead to increase in the price of fertiliser as well as city gas like CNG that uses gas brought through the pipeline starting from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh and running up to Bharuch in Gujarat.  The pipeline primarily transports KG-D6 gas, which has steadily dipped from 69.43 million standard cubic meters per day achieved in March 2010 to under 3 mmscmd.  PNGRB in a 49-page order went into cost calculations and other parameters to fix the tariff.  &amp;quot;The tariff has been worked out based on information provided by the entity and deliberations. However, PNGRB intends to verify/audit the information provided for tariff determination and method of cost allocation, etc. by an internal team of PNGRB or by an external agency,&amp;quot; the order said.  The tariff, it said, will be subject to revision based on the audit of information and data.  Originally, EWPL had proposed a levelised tariff of Rs 55.91 per mmBtu for transporting the gas beginning April 1, 2009 but PNGRB fixed a provisional tariff of Rs 52.53 per mmBtu.  The company in October 2017 proposed a final tariff for the pipeline at Rs 78.72 effective from April 1, 2009, till the end of the economic life of the pipeline - up to March 31, 2034.  When PNGRB sought clarifications, EWPL updated the tariff filing to state that Rs 52.23 per mmBtu would be the tariff till 2017 and Rs 151.84 would be charged from 2018-19 to 2035-36.  The PNGRB order said the pipeline operator has claimed a total capex of Rs 18,307.37 crore under two heads - actual capex of Rs 16,347.96 crore and future capex of Rs 1,959.41 crore.  PNGRB said when it first fixed the provisional tariff, it had assessed the pipeline's carrying capacity of 85 million standard cubic metres per day including 21.25 mmscmd for use on a common carrier, open access and non-discriminatory basis by any third party.  But the company challenged this first before the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity (APTEL) and then before the Delhi High Court. The Court had in April last year ordered fixing of the tariff once the quorum of PNGRB was complete.  PNGRB became fully functional a year back when the government made appointments of Chairman and members of the Board.  PNGRB sought views of stakeholders on EWPL's tariff filing and gave a detailed order after considering all views.

Bharti Airtel reversed the trend of last two months and lost 1.5 million subscribers, taking its subscriber base to 340 million as at December-end.

The company lost 2.3 million customers in December 2018, taking its subscriber base to 419 million at the end of the month.    What to expect going forward? We see no signs of rising average revenue per user (ARPUs) as Jio continues to aggressively add customers on the back of its Jio Phone and post-paid customers. As Jio has not been slashing tariffs further, we expect stability in ARPUs going forward.

In the last two sessions, Nifty has formed a double bottom at 10,912 odd levels.  Nifty has formed a bullish rounding bottom on the intraday hourly charts. The primary trend of the Nifty is still positive with the index currently trading above its 5, 20 and 200-days simple moving average (SMA).  Last Friday, when the government presented its Interim Budget, Nifty made an intraday top at 10,983. This was the third time when Nifty took resistance around 10,980-10,988 range.  On Dec 19, 2018, Nifty made a top at 10,985 and on Jan 21, 2019, Nifty made a top at 10,987. There is a triple top formation on the Nifty daily charts and any level above 10,988 resistances would be considered as a breakout from the consolidation pattern.  However, the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap 100 indices continued their underperformance by falling 0.9 percent and 1.55 percent, respectively. On YTD basis also, both the indices are down 6 percent each as against 0.50 percent gain in the Nifty.  On the Derivatives front as well, we have seen long positions being built in Nifty and Bank Nifty Futures&rsquo; during the first two days of the February series.  Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) created fresh longs in both &mdash; Index and Stock Futures&rsquo; segment on Friday. Amongst the Options, Put writing was seen around 10700-10800 levels.  Moreover, 10700 is the level which consists of highest Open Interest (OI) amongst the Nifty February Put options. Considering the technical and derivative evidence discussed above, we believe that the short-term trend in the Nifty is still bullish and one should remain optimistic about the market for the coming days.  Therefore, our advice would be to go long in Nifty with a stop loss of 10,700 levels and a target of 11,200 and 11,350 levels.  Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 7-10% return in the next 1 month:  RIL: Buy| LTP: Rs 1290| Target: Rs. 1385| Stop-Loss Rs 1230| Return 7%  Reliance Industries has given a breakout on the daily chart on Monday by closing above the resistance level of Rs 1265. The primary trend of the Reliance is bullish as the stock price is trading above its 200-day SMA since January 2017.  The momentum indicators and Oscillators like RSI and MACD are showing strength on the daily charts. RIL is trading just 3 percent off from the all-time high of 1329 which it touched in August last year and the technical indicators are pointing that the stock is likely to cross that high in the days to come.  Therefore, we recommend investors to buy Reliance Industries at the current market price of Rs 1290 and average at 1260 for the target of 1385. Investors can keep a stop loss below Rs 1230.  Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 1272| Target: Rs 1370| Stop-Loss: Rs 1220| Return 8%  The primary trend of the Kotak Mahindra Bank is bullish with higher tops and higher bottom formation on the daily chart. The stock price is trading above its 5, 20 and 200-day SMA indicating bullish trend for the short to medium-term.  Oscillators and momentum indicators are also showing strength in the stock. Private sector banks are doing well and look good on the charts for the short term.  Therefore, we recommend investors to buy Kotak Mahindra Bank for the target of 1370 and keep a stop loss below Rs 1220  Jubilant FoodWorks: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,396| Target: Rs 1,535 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300| Return 10%  Jubilant FoodWorks has broken out on the daily chart on Monday by closing above the resistance level of 1370 levels to close at a five-month high.

India's No.1 oil refining and petrochemical company plans to roll out its online shopping platform that will combine its retail arm's nearly 10,000 stores in over 6,500 towns as well as neighbourhood retailers with its fast expanding mobile phone network that already has 28 crore subscribers.  &amp;quot;Our analysis suggests RIL can become a market leader in telecom and media, while gaining significant share in retail/e-commerce.  &amp;quot;Its success could be built on an ecosystem or bundling strategy, and a home-court advantage, similar to Alibaba's success in China, beyond explicit or implicit policy support,&amp;quot; brokerage firm UBS said.  While Amazon's strong 'Prime' membership growth has been a key pillar of its business, Reliance has similarly built a strong telecom subscriber base.  The company has already surprised investors by reaching a market-leading position in telecom within a short span of two-and-a-half years. Its edge in fixed broadband (FTTH) derives from low penetration, high capital intensity, a fibre roll-out lead, and content tie-ups.  &amp;quot;In retail/e-commerce, despite competition from well-funded global companies, RIL's wide footprint of physical stores along with its omnichannel focus, subscriber reach and regulations governing foreign e-commerce entities could help it gain a 300 basis point market share in high-growth, modern retail,&amp;quot; it said.  The company's traditional energy businesses have funded the consumer segment and remain key to its market-leading position.  RIL, it said, can potentially become a unique quadruple play by bundling connectivity, carriage, content and commerce to gain higher share of consumers' wallet.  Listing some comparables between Alibaba and Reliance, it said pursuing an ecosystem or a bundling strategy in a high-growth fragmented retail sector with lower online penetration and home-turf advantage are common to both.  Amazon's core value proposition to customers is its 'Prime' subscription, which offers free shipping and video and music content. &amp;quot;Our assessment of the capital framework, regulations, business positioning and emerging trends in each of its consumer-facing business indicates RIL can lead in telecom and media and gain significant share in retail/e-commerce,&amp;quot; it said.  &amp;quot;Can RIL evolve into India's Amazon/Alibaba/Walmart?,&amp;quot; UBS asked and answered it with a &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;  Currently, the company's energy business contributes 75 per cent of its EBITDA. Consumer business accounts for the remaining 25 per cent.  &amp;quot;We think there are many similarities between the India of today and the China of 10 years ago. India's retail landscape is fragmented, and there are significant demographic and socioeconomic differences from top to low-tier cities.  &amp;quot;Online penetration is low in India, with e-commerce accounting for 2.3 per cent of retail sales in 2018; in comparison, China's e-commerce penetration is over 20 per cent currently. This means India is still not at the sweet spot for e-commerce adoption, where mainstream adopters shift rapidly to online spending and platforms experience hyper-growth,&amp;quot; UBS said.  Reliance also has a 'home court' advantage.  &amp;quot;There are now more supportive policies in India. India's e-commerce law should be supportive of domestic companies, including RIL. In China, Alibaba was also able to overtake a dominant eBay in the early days because it invested more both to sign up merchants and to acquire customers.  &amp;quot;Beyond any explicit or implicit policy support, we believe this home court advantage is important. Companies that have to justify years of heavy investments in a foreign market often at times will be less aggressive than a domestic one that has nowhere to go if it fails to gain traction,&amp;quot; it added.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

Reliance Group's flagship company became the first Indian private sector corporate to cross Rs 10,000 crore quarterly profits milestone.

The year-on-year growth in profit was 8.8 percent and revenue growth was 56.7 percent.  &amp;quot;Increase in revenue is primarily on account of higher price realisations and volumes for petrochemical and refining businesses along with continuing strong growth momentum in consumer businesses,&amp;quot; RIL said.  Reliance Jio reported profit at Rs 831 crore for the quarter, higher by 22.1 percent compared to Rs 681 crore in previous quarter and 65 percent compared a year-ago period.

It said that the retail performance was stellar. Weak petchem was offset by strong performance by other segments, analysts at the firm wrote in their research note.  It sees an upside of 32 percent.  Further, the retail earnings before interest and taxes more than trebled year on year, while consolidated capital expenditure fell 30 percent QoQ.  CLSA also believes that Jio may close a deal within H1CY19 to monetise its tower &amp;amp;amp; fibre assets.

But slightly weak performance in refining segment may impact profitability.  The country's largest company by market capitalisation will announce its December-quarter earnings on January 17. The key data points to look at in results would be the growth in retail, telecom and petrochemical businesses.  &amp;quot;Petrochemical segment is expected to do better due to healthy deltas and strong volume growth in the segment. Positive developments in the telecom and retail segments should drive growth further for the company,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said.  Antique Stock Broking said consolidated profit could be marginally higher QoQ&nbsp; (and up 3 percent YoY) on robust profitability in retail segment, coupled with healthy earnings in Jio, lower interest cost and higher other income.&nbsp;This could offset weakness in refining and petrochemical margins.  Retail/digital business profits are likely to grow by 6 percent/ 10 percent sequentially, IDBI Capital said.  Most analysts expect gross refining margins (GRMs) at around $8-9 a barrel for the quarter-ended December 2018 against $9.5 a barrel in the previous quarter and $11.6 a barrel in Q3FY18.  In comparison, benchmark Singapore GRM declined sharply by 30.3 percent QoQ to $4.3 a barrel in Q3FY19 due to weakness in gasoline and naphtha crack spread.  International benchmark Brent crude fell 35 percent in December quarter and 6 percent in 2018 on expected slowdown in demand growth led by global recession and higher non-OPEC outputs.  &amp;quot;We expect earnings of Reliance Industries to get impacted by weakness in refining margin (expect GRM of $8.5 a barrel in Q3FY19), partially offsetting the benefit of weak rupee and higher petrochemical margins (due to feedstock cost advantage),&amp;quot; Sharekhan said.  Consolidated revenue growth is expected to be strong on-year basis, but could be flat on sequential basis, said analysts who expect around 30 percent growth in topline YoY.  &amp;quot;Higher oil prices (+10.9 percent YoY), depreciating INR (+11.5 percent YoY), higher petchem volumes (+16.3 percent YoY) will drive robust revenue growth,&amp;quot; Edelweiss said.

Jio&rsquo;s freebies intensified the price war leading to consolidation in the industry and elimination of marginal players. Big players faced the heat due to a steady decline in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and found it difficult to maintain their market share as Jio&rsquo;s competitive pricing helped it dd new customers. This trend continues and was visible in the latest subscriber addition numbers reported by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).  What does the latest TRAI data suggest? Recently,&nbsp;the telecom published&nbsp;subscriber data for October 2018. The industry continues to grow and witnessed an addition of 8.5 million new customers, taking the total subscriber base to 1.02 billion.  Jio reducing the gap with leaders Jio continues to maintain its momentum and added 8.5 million subscribers in October 2018, the highest monthly subscriber additions in&nbsp;a month. Significant addition was driven by JioPhone2 flash sale. Jio currently has an active subscriber base of 216 million. On the back of its competitive pricing strategy, it continues to gain market share and reduced the gap with incumbents. Its market share touched 21.1 percent in October 2018, up from 20.5 percent in the preceding month.  Bharti Airtel&nbsp;bucks last three-month's trend Bharti Airtel, the leader in term of active subscriber base before the Vodafone-Idea merger, saw net monthly additions after three consecutive months of disappointment. It added 3.4 million subscribers, taking the subscriber base to 340 million. It maintained its market share at 33.3 percent.  Vodafone&ndash;Idea &ndash; struggle is on The company struggling the most is Vodafone-Idea, which has been continuously losing market share. It saw its subscriber base and market share fall 20.1 million and 303.6 bps&nbsp;over the last six months, respectively. The company lost 2.9 million customers in October 2018, with its total subscriber base at 400 million at the end of the month.    What to expect going forward? We see no signs of rising ARPUs yet as Jio continues to aggressively add customers on the back of its JioPhone and postpaid customers. Although Jio has not been slashing tariffs any further now, we expect stability in ARPUs going forward. But competition is not expected to ebb in the near term and hence advise investors to tread cautiously in the sector.

During that visit, he also held talks with Ambani but choose to tweet about those discussions only this week.  In an Arabic tweet, which was translated using online tools, Al-Falih said he was delighted to meet Ambani.  At the meeting &amp;quot;we discussed opportunities for joint investments and cooperation in petrochemical, refining and communications projects.&amp;quot;  He also tweeted a picture of the meeting where Ambani is dressed in a business suit, a sharp contrast to other pictures of his in traditional attire during the pre-wedding festivities held on December 8 and 9.  No details of the meeting were available from Reliance.  Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar with a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum.  Reliance plans to expand its only-for-exports SEZ refining capacity to just over 41 million tonnes from current 35.2 million tonnes but does not have any plans to set up a new refinery in the country.  It is presently focused on expanding petrochemical and telecom business, industry sources said.  Crude oil is the basic raw material for the manufacturing of petrochemicals.  Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is keen to get a foothold in the world's fastest-growing fuel market so as to get a captive customer for crude oil it produces.  Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, and its partner Abu Dabhi National Oil Co (ADNOC) have picked up 50 per cent stake in a planned USD 44-billion refinery in Maharashtra but the project is facing problems in acquiring land due to protests from local politicians.  Aramco and ADNOC will together hold 50 per cent stake in the 60 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) refinery and adjacent 18 MTPA petrochemical complex planned to be built at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra by 2025.  The two will supply half of the crude oil required for processing at the refinery.  Like other major producers, the two are looking to lock in customers in the world's third-largest oil consumer through the investment. Kuwait too is looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.  Saudi Aramco is also keen on retailing fuel in India. A refinery in India can also be a base for it to export fuel to deficit countries in Europe and the Americas.  India has a refining capacity of 247.6 million tonnes, which exceeded the demand of 206.2 million tonnes."

The unspent component of the mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) rose to Rs 1,717 crore in fiscal 2018 as against Rs 1,574 crore in the previous fiscal year, according to the data released by Prime Database.  The agency did not offer any particular reasons for a large quantum of money going unspent, though. It could be because of there was no demand for the money from third-party agencies or it could be a reflection of the overall rise in the profitability of these companies.  The new Companies Act of 2013 mandates publicly traded companies with Rs 100 crore in annual profit or Rs 500 crore in annual turnover to set aside 2 percent of their profits for affirmative/inclusive social action.  Only half of the 1,708 companies listed on NSE have a CSR committee in place despite the CSR Act mandating the same.  However, the overall spends by the 1,080 NSE-listed companies who fall under the 2 percent mandatory CSR spend category rose 11 percent in fiscal 2018 to Rs 10,030 crore from Rs 9,060 crore in the previous year.  In the past four years since the introduction of the mandatory CSR spends, the spending by the NSE-listed companies has grown at a compounded rate of 16 percent per annum.  It said inequalities reduction, national heritage, the Armed forces, sports, technology incubators and slum development were the most neglected areas when it comes to corporates choosing for their CSR spends.  The spending list was topped by education sector at Rs 3,817 crore and followed by healthcare which saw inflows of Rs 2,509 crore, it said.  Maharashtra topped the list of states receiving the largest amount of money for CSR, followed by Gujarat and Rajasthan, while eight states saw a decline in spends.  The top companies in the list of spenders were led by Reliance Industries at Rs 745 crore, followed by ONGC (Rs 503.44 crore), TCS (Rs 400 crore and HDFC Bank (Rs 374.54 crore), it said.  The total number of companies which missed the mandatory 2 percent CSR spend target came down to 345 in FY18 from 361 in the previous year, it said.

The company is preparing to take on Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries-owned Reliance Jio&nbsp;by expanding its 4G network mobile tower sites. It is also planning to&nbsp;divide its market into four categories and adopt a specific strategy for each of them, sources told the paper.  The management of the loss-making Vodafone Idea, which was formed after Idea Cellular and Vodafone India merged in August, reportedly held&nbsp;a meeting with telecom analysts on&nbsp;November 21 to discuss its revival plans and strategy.  A person present at the meeting told the paper that the management believes a tariff hike is imminent and that it will be significant one, given the company's negative free-cash situation.  Vodafone Idea currently 4G coverage in 50 percent of the areas it serves. It hopes to push this to 70 percent in the next six months, and to 80 percent in 2019-20, the person was quoted as saying.  The telecom giant is currently awaiting full realisation of merger synergies, as the&nbsp;integration of spectrum assets and networks of both Vodafone and Idea is underway.  The merger of Idea Cellular and Vodafone was triggered by fierce competition in the telecom sector after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.  Vodafone Idea announced its first quarterly results in September, reporting a loss of Rs 4,970 crore. The company's average revenue per user (ARPU) came in at Rs 88, much lower than Airtel's Rs 101 and Jio's Rs 131.70.  Last month, Airtel said it had simplified 7-8 of its tariffs, with minimum recharge plans starting at Rs 35. The aim was to reduce the number of marginal customers it had, control expenses and provide better services to its users.  The board of Vodafone Idea has set up a committee of directors to explore avenues to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore of capital. The committee will also look into a potential sale of the company's fibre network, which has over 156,000 km of intra-city and inter-city fibre routes.  The company has acknowledged a liquidity crunch in the telecom sector and has sought the government's help to meet its financial obligations, a government official said.

Speaking at the 24th MobiCom conference here, Ambani, who heads the oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries, said India's digital transformation is &amp;quot;unmatch and unprecedented&amp;quot; after it took leadership position from being 155th in wireless broadband technology adoption in just 24 months.  Back in the 1990s, when Reliance was building its oil refinery and petrochemical projects, India's gross domestic product (GDP) was around USD 350 billion and had just come out of a severe financial crisis.  &amp;quot;Very few in the world thought that our country's prospects were bright. Today our GDP is nearing USD 3 trillion, and India is well on its way to becoming one of the three richest countries in the world,&amp;quot; he said.  Ambani, the richest Indian, said mobile computing as a catalyst is driving massive data consumption &ndash; and this has given young Indians a fertile ground for disruptive ideas.  Cloud computing and networking technologies have used broadband as a foundational enabler &ndash; leading to Indian entrepreneurs starting to make a global impact.  &amp;quot;In the next two decades, I can confidently say that India shall be leading the world and shall contribute to the next wave of global economic growth,&amp;quot; he said.  India languished on the fringes during the first two industrial revolutions powered by coal and steam and electricity and oil, respectively, and only started playing catch-up in the computer-driven third industrial revolution, he said.  &amp;quot;The fourth industrial revolution is now upon us. It is marked by a fusion of technologies straddling the physical, digital and biological worlds,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I can say with full confidence that India has a chance of not just participating in the fourth industrial revolution, but also leading it.&amp;quot;  This is possible because the India of today is remarkably different from the India of yesterday. &amp;quot;India's vast tech-savvy young population is its key strength. Just imagine the kind of connected intelligence India can create if the power of billion-plus minds is combined!,&amp;quot; he said.  Also, being a democracy that is run on the model of equitable and inclusive growth, it is openly embracing the digital technologies of tomorrow. It is a rich and fertile ground for entrepreneurship and has emerged as the fastest growing start-up base worldwide, he said.  &amp;quot;Today, the nation is home to the third largest number of technology-driven start-ups in the world. Never before has India witnessed such an explosion of entrepreneurial spirit,&amp;quot; he added.  Ambani said India needs to prepare itself for a period of information and digital abundance, adapt itself to the scorching pace of innovation and learn to collaborate on scale, quickly transform the idea into a breakthrough innovation, shift from a system of time-bound education to a mode of continuous learning and create more employment opportunities than what new and disruptive technologies take away.  &amp;quot;We have to groom our children to be digitally-savvy right from school. Schools should train students in 'the four C-s' &ndash; critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. These are the skills required to build the foundation for a sustained leadership in the digital age for India.  &amp;quot;Within a single generation, we can empower and enrich our vast and young human resources to give India a competitive edge in the world,&amp;quot; he said.  Governments, businesses and civil society organisations should put together an ecosystem for massive upskilling of the workforce, he stated.  &amp;quot;We now have the opportunity to digitally reinvent all sectors of our economy &ndash; be it financial services, commerce, manufacturing, agriculture, education, and healthcare. India can leapfrog the competition and lead the world in each of these sectors,&amp;quot; he said.  Ambani said there was a pressing need to create a digital green revolution by encouraging adoption of technologies for water conservation, soil management, precision farming and waste reduction to enhance agricultural productivity.  Secondly, there is a need for good quality education to make India's youth a productive asset, he said adding there is also a requirement to make healthcare affordable.  Talking about Reliance Jio, his telecom venture that stormed the industry by combining free voice calls and SMS with cheap data, he said India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband.  &amp;quot;Jio is determined to move India to among the top 3 in fixed-line broadband, too,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Our state-of-the-art digital infrastructure provides mobile and broadband connectivity across the country, with the largest fibre footprint.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

While the refining and upstream oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segments bore the brunt of rising crude prices, petrochemicals registered healthy top-line growth and margin improvement. However, what stole the show was the momentum observed in the retail (Reliance Retail) and telecommunication (Reliance Jio) divisions.  Mukesh Ambani, in his address to Reliance Industries' shareholders in the FY18 annual report, set his vision to ensure that the revenue contribution of these consumer-centric segments is on par with the non-consumer ones (refining, upstream oil and gas, petrochemicals) over the next decade. Consequently, a major shift in the conglomerate&rsquo;s long-term strategy, which is aimed at tapping markets and consumers across the country, is worth taking note of.  Since B2C segments are steady in nature and also happen to be less volatile to economic/global/commodity uncertainties in comparison to the B2B segments, prospects of revenue and earnings visibility are likely to be better.  Furthermore, it is pertinent to understand the synergies that Reliance Industries could derive by integrating the customer base of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio. For instance, a Jio user can get good deals on purchasing products from the online platforms or brick-and-mortar stores of Reliance Retail, whereas Reliance Retail can leverage its deep pan-India presence to increase the number of Jio subscriptions through various offers.  While Jio&rsquo;s entry in 2016 changed the landscape and dynamics of India&rsquo;s telecom industry dramatically and structurally, Reliance Retail could possibly do the same on the retailing front. So, what&rsquo;s in store for the retail mammoth in times to come?  About Reliance Retail   Reliance Retail is India&rsquo;s biggest multi-category product retailer in terms of store network and sales.        As on 30th&nbsp;September&nbsp;2018, Reliance Retail operated 9,146 stores with an area of over 19.50 million square feet and 512 petro outlets.  Q2 FY19 review  Accelerated store additions and healthy demand across all consumption brackets caused revenues to more than double year-on-year (YoY). Reliance Retail clocked sales of Rs 32,436 crore in Q2 as against Rs 14,646 crore in the same quarter of FY18. 138 new stores and 535 Jio Points were added during the quarter.  Margins for the quarter stood at 3.8 percent, up 155 basis points YoY, on account of operating leverage.  The path ahead  For Reliance Retail, most of the incremental revenue growth in the coming fiscals will be driven by aggressive store additions across all segments (lifestyle, grocery, white goods, fuel, connectivity). Extensive use of omnichannel (i.e. a blend of online and brick-and-mortar retail) will be important in widening the market reach. Therefore, top-line traction is expected to be intact.  In the case of apparel and consumables, the share of private labels to annual turnover is likely to increase gradually too. Besides enhancing brand and product visibility, the move should aid margin accretion owing to economies of scale and lower procurement costs.  With more than 50 million customers already covered under loyalty programmes, a lot would depend on how Reliance Retail capitalises on its&nbsp;strengths to achieve higher conversion-to-footfall ratios. Should it succeed in this regard, the improved asset turns will have a positive rub-off on the financials.  In the case of fuel retailing, top-line growth will be volume-driven. Commissioning of new outlets, coupled with re-commissioning of existing ones, would be the factors to watch out for.  How big can Reliance Retail be?  Amid economic uncertainties at the domestic and international level, consumption theme, being the most secular in nature, has been the Street&rsquo;s favourite. Unsurprisingly, valuations of most retail stocks, even after witnessing sharp corrections of late, continue to trade at elevated multiples.  In the context of Reliance Retail, this fact assumes even more importance considering its huge revenue base, large store count, growing contribution to Reliance Industries&rsquo; consolidated sales in the recent past and an ambitious plan going forward.    Its target is to open more than 6,000 outlets across the nation with a top-line potential of approximately $20 billion by FY20-end.&nbsp;If this goal is achieved, Reliance Retail could capture roughly 5 percent of India&rsquo;s fast-growing retail market.  Given Reliance Retail&rsquo;s growth pace in the past, this objective seems achievable. In the last 5 years, it has been consistently expanding at the rate of more than one new store each day and footfalls at outlets have nearly doubled every 2 years. It also enjoys the first-mover advantage in many cities.  If the recent quarterly results of Reliance Retail are anything to go by, its margins could, at the very least, be in the range of 4.5 to 5 percent by the end of FY20.  Reliance Retail has been valued using the market cap to sales methodology to understand its significance to the parent company (i.e. Reliance Industries). We considered the median market cap to sales multiple of India&rsquo;s leading retail names for our analysis.  Using a market cap to sales multiple of 3, we derive the value of Reliance Retail at Rs 3,73,668 crore, which is close to 56 percent of&nbsp;Reliance Industries' current market capitalization.    If we exclude the retail portion, Reliance Industries&rsquo; market cap stands at approximately Rs 4,13,826 crore. Reliance Retail&rsquo;s valuation, in this case, would be almost similar to all the other segments of Reliance Industries put together.  So, if Reliance Retail is able to earn better margins, its market cap to sales multiple will witness a re-rating. This could be a major game changer for Reliance Industries and drive its valuation upward.  What also sets Reliance Industries apart from the rest is its increasing focus on futuristic businesses. The company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired 12.7 percent stake in SkyTran, a high-speed public transportation (through magnetic levitation) company.  In due course, we see a lot of steam in Reliance Industries on the back of initiatives undertaken by it in synergistic domains (stake acquisitions in Den Networks and Hathway), consumer-oriented consistent growth verticals (Reliance Retail, Reliance Jio) and differentiated technologies (SkyTran). Investors should, therefore, keep a close eye on how developments pan out on the organic and inorganic fronts.

",,"Business, India, Podcast",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/podcast-|-editor39s-pickday-â-why-reliance-is-onacquisition-spree_11565261.html,"Rakesh Sharma Moneycontrol News  The second quarter results of Reliance Industries are out and the response to the earnings has been mixed to say the least. Despite registering its highest-ever quarter profit, Reliance was one of the major drags on the Sensex today. What else is also out is the news that RIL has been making a few new deals.    Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), acquired 12.7 percent shareholding in SkyTran Inc. A US-based technology company, SkyTran aims to solve traffic congestion by introducing personal rapid transit systems. The news of this Reliance alliance with SkyTran comes close on the heels of two strategic investments that RIL made in Den Networks and Hathway Cable and Datacom. RIL made an investment of Rs 2,290 crore for 66 percent stake in Den and Rs 2,940 crore for 51.3 percent stake in Hathway. What these alliances mean for Reliance will be the major talking point on this edition of our Pick of the Day. My name is Rakesh Sharma, and you are listening to Moneycontrol.  Nitin Agrawal, writing for Moneycontrol, goes on to note, &ldquo;In recent times,&nbsp;Reliance Industries (RIL) has shifted its focus from traditional to futuristic businesses driven by advanced technology that could improve quality of life and make the business relevant for the future.&rdquo;  Jio, launched last year and quite possibly the biggest disruptor in the mobile technology space we have seen in recent times, is driven by VoLTE technology, an advanced technology to transfer calls over data networks. It is in the same vein of future-forwardness that this acquisition of 12.7 percent shareholding (on fully diluted basis) in SkyTran can be seen. RIL also has the option to further invest up to $25 million in convertible notes, subject to approval from SkyTran&rsquo;s board.  Anyone stuck in Bangalore traffic, or for that matter, LA traffic, knows only too well what a menace intense road traffic can be to a good quality of life, and indeed economic development across the globe. SkyTran is a company that aims to address this all too familiar, all too global, problem by creating a transport option that is high-speed, scalable, and low-cost. Commenting on the investment, Akash Ambani, Director, Reliance Jio, said, &ldquo;Our partnership with SkyTran reflects our commitment to invest in futuristic technologies. Reliance is well-poised to capitalize on its existing business portfolio and capabilities to accelerate the development of SkyTran across the world and especially in India.&rdquo;  John Cole, Founder and CEO at SkyTran, said, &ldquo;We are excited to be working with Reliance. Reliance brings tremendous infrastructure and technical expertise and the ability to execute at the largest scale. We believe our partnership with Reliance has the potential to improve the lives of people in India and across the globe.&rdquo;  SkyTran, which has partnered with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the US and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in Israel, has developed magnetic levitation (MagLev) technology for implementing personal transportation systems aimed at solving the problem of traffic congestion globally.&nbsp;MagLev is a technology some of us are familiar with &ndash; the fastest speeds achieved for a train &ndash; 603 kmph &ndash; was in Japan by JR Central's L0 superconducting Maglev on 21 April 2015.  SkyTran has 8 approved patents and 40 plus patents are pending approval, globally, including in India. The proposed SkyTran network would consist of &ldquo;computer-controlled passenger pods running on its patented Passive Magnetic Levitation technology and would use IT, Telecom, IoT and Advanced Materials technologies to transport passengers in a fast, safe, green, and economical manner.&rdquo; Following this investment, Reliance said it will work closely with SkyTran to develop pilot implementations followed by implementation of its network in India at scale. Reliance would also play an active role in further advancing the SkyTran solution, especially in Telecom (4G/5G/IoT/Giga Fiber), Digital Platforms and Services, Advanced Materials &amp;amp;amp; Electric Batteries areas. Reliance would also nominate a director on the Board of SkyTran.  Reliance is not the first big name to be interested and investing in SkyTran. The company has received funding from well-known names like Google Chairman Eric Schmidt. Even the US Department of Transportation has provided funding to SkyTran.  The SkyTran partnership with RIL in India aims to address the burgeoning personal and economic problem of road congestion by building a rapid transit system. Run on non-polluting technology, this partnership also aims to address the increasing levels of pollution in modern India. From the perspective of Reliance, the partnership with SkyTran is an indication of a growing willingness to participate in the technology of tomorrow, and position the petrol-to-telecom giant as a leading figure in adapting to the ways of a fast-changing world. Considering the alarming report from the UN IPCC, it is about time that behemoth corporate houses that rely on non-renewable sources not just for their own profits but also as the fuel for nation-building, start thinking of ways to race towards zero emission, and this may well be seen as a token step in that direction. How practical it will be, and if it will ever take off, or levitate shall we say, is anyone&rsquo;s guess.  Recent acquisition spree by alliance  Reliance, being Reliance, does not need the excuse of Diwali and Dussehra to go on a shopping spree. It has been on one for the past year or so. As of July this year, the company had struck at least 12 deals over 12 months with an estimated tab of about Rs 28,900 crore ($4.21 billion), according to calculations by Jefferies Group LLC and Bloomberg. Ten of these are related to Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s consumer business. Ambani has also capitalized on India&rsquo;s ongoing bad-debt issues with purchases of distressed or insolvent companies including a local textile-maker, a carbon-fiber firm and the wireless assets of an indebted telecom company, reported Mint earlier in July this year.  The acquisitions also point to a certain pattern, according to industry-watchers. To build an integrated digital offering around the emerging crown jewel of the Reliance family, Jio. If pre-2017 was the era of petrochemicals and building massive refinery complexes, it seems post-2017 is going to be a new big chapter in the Reliance saga with Jio as its protagonist with all these other acquisitions and deals in one way or other lending a supporting role to the hero, Jio Ambani. Jio Ambani also hopes to be the leader of the new tech space. Last month, RIL invested $8 million in San Diego-headquartered NetraDyne Inc., an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up. In June,&nbsp;RIIHL&nbsp;had invested $16 million in the start-up that focuses on fleet management, automotive, security and surveillance.&nbsp;The company&rsquo;s latest investment translates into a 37.4 percent equity stake in the firm, RIL said in an exchange filing.  In the past year alone, RIL and its subsidiaries, have been acquiring stakes in various ventures that can one way or other be linked to the bouquet offerings that Jio hopes to be &ndash; in terms of boosting digital content for Jio, there are partnerships with The Indian Film Combine, Eros International, and Saavn.  In order to enhance the artificial intelligence arm of Jio, in addition it to its venture with NetraDyne, Reliance has pumped in $180 million in Bangalore-based Embibe, which uses data analytics to deliver personalised learning outcomes to students. KareXpert, another venture that RIL has invested in, is developing a one-stop digital health platform. Earlier in June, Reliance acquired Oregon-headquartered Radisys Corporation, which it said would help accelerate Jio&rsquo;s global innovation and technology in areas of 5G, IoT and open-source architecture adoption.  Considering it&rsquo;s Navratri, I am tempted to think of Durga with her ten arms, each wielding a different weapon. Jio seems to be morphing into a similar entity &ndash; godly or not &ndash; with each of these ventures arming it with new qualities. The businesses that established RIL as a gargantuan force will, no doubt, continue to play a role in the company&rsquo;s evolution into the 21st century, but the lead will be taken over by the new digital kids on the block &ndash; Jio and JioGigaFiber &ndash; currently in prep school, acquiring all that they need to be the new (and hopefully green) leaders of the Reliance family, and therefore by extension, 21st century India.

Although slightly soft compared to the preceding quarter, gross refining margins were substantially above the Singapore benchmark. The overall strong performance was majorly driven by growth in the petrochemical, digital and retail segments. Consumer business maintained its momentum.  Jio continued to impress with quarterly performance. Despite strong competition, operating revenue increased and the company was able to sustain operating margins as well.    Segment wise performance       Petrochemical &ndash; robust performance  As expected, the petrochemical segment reported a robust performance and contributed to overall profitability. The 56 percent topline growth was driven by a mix of higher prices and higher volume, especially in the new products of paraxylene (PX) and refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC). EBIT growth of 63 percent was driven by higher volumes with the stabilisation of the ROGC, its downstream units and the new PX facility. Better margins in the integrated polyester chain also helped improve segment profitability though gains were partially offset by softer polymer margins  Refining - sequentially soft    Gross refining margin at $9.5 per bbl was way above the benchmark Singapore GRM of $6.1 per, but slightly soft sequentially. While revenue increased by 41.6 percent year-on-year (YoY), the segment EBIT declined by 19.6 percent YoY. The performance was affected by substantially higher crude oil prices, soft gasoline margins, and tighter light-heavy differential. The shutdown of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCC) also impacted the segment's performance.  Upstream segment - performance remained weak  Volumes in the upstream oil and gas business saw a natural decline which led to an almost 12 percent contraction in revenue, despite higher prices of crude and gas. Production from both the domestic business and US operations fell 25 and 31 percent, respectively.  Reliance retail &ndash; strong traction  Accelerated store additions and traction across all consumption brackets led to strong revenue growth in the retail segment. Around 138 new stores and 535 Jio Points were added during the quarter. Reliance Retail operated 9,146 stores with an area of over 19.50 million square feet and 512 petro outlets.  Operating leveraged aided a margin expansion of 155 basis points YoY to 3.8 percent.  Going forward, revenue growth will be predominantly driven by network expansion across all verticals (Reliance Trends, Reliance Fresh, Reliance Smart, Reliance Digital, Jio Points).  In the grocery and apparel segments, the emphasis is on improving the private label brands portfolio, developing the omnichannel network and leveraging the loyalty programme customer base of over 50 million customers. In fuel retailing, re-commissioning of fuel outlets and volume growth will be the factors to watch out for.  Jio &ndash; adding to the muscle  Jio&rsquo;s net revenues rose 13.9 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 9240 crore. Growth was driven by a net addition of 37 million subscribers during the quarter. Subscriber addition was higher than all competitors put together and the base has touched 250 million within 25 months of its commencement of services.  Jio&rsquo;s ARPU (average revenue per user) witnessed a marginal dip of 2.1 percent on QoQ basis to Rs 131.7 per month.    Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA margin was flat compared to the preceding quarter. Interest cost outlay increased by 29.7 percent leading to 11.3 percent increase in profit-after-tax (PAT), lower than the growth in EBITDA.  Jio plans to launch JioGigaFiber and reach 50 million homes across 1,100 cities. To expedite this, it has bought a strategic stake in Den Networks Limited (Den) and Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited (Hathway). This will also help Jio access &nbsp;local cable operators, content producers and the companies.  Outlook   RIL has completed most major planned capital expenditures and the units have started stabilizing. With projects starting to deliver, the company is likely to see steady cash flows during the year which would enable further operating efficiencies and higher returns. The overall macro environment is also conducive for the various verticals where the company has exposure.  With full commissioning of the ROGC and PX units, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business.  The company is now focussing on aggressively expanding the retail consumer business presence. The segment has been delivering stellar growth and we expect this to continue and margins to improve further with increasing volumes.  We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of significant capacity, latest 4G technology, rollout of JioGigaFiber, partnership with Den and Hathway and huge unmet potential available in India.

Good petrochemical and telecom businesses offset lower other income and weak refining business.  Consolidated revenue during the quarter grew by 11.3 percent to Rs 1.43 lakh crore driven by growth across segments QoQ.  Profit on year increased 17.35 percent and revenue jumped 56.66 percent in second quarter.  &amp;quot;Company delivered robust operating and financial results for the quarter despite macro headwinds, with strong growth in earnings on YoY basis,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  Read the latest updates on Reliance Industries here.  World-class petrochemicals assets contributed record earnings; endorsing benefits of diversified feedstock, integration and superior product portfolio, he added.  Petrochemical business during the quarter grew by 8.6 percent sequentially&nbsp; (up 56.2 percent YoY) to Rs 43,745 crore due to increase in volumes and price realisations.  Petchem EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) rose 3.3 percent QoQ (up 63.7 percent YoY) to a record level of Rs 8,120 crore in Q2. The growth was driven by strong YoY volume growth led by successful stabilisation of the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC, its downstream units and new PX facility.  Sharp increase in segment performance also reflects improvement in the integrated polyester chain margins partly offset by the softer polymer margins, Reliance said.  Refining segment revenue during the quarter increased 3.25 percent QoQ (up 41.6 percent YoY) to Rs 98,760 crore with its EBIT growing only 0.13 percent QoQ (down 19.6 percent YoY) to Rs 5,322 crore.  Refining and marketing performance was impacted by significantly higher crude price (up 47 percent&nbsp;YoY), tighter light-heavy differential and adverse movement in light distillate cracks on Y-o-Y basis and shutdown of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCC), the company said.  Mukesh Ambani Group company further said gross refining margin for the quarter stood at $9.50 a barrel,&nbsp;outperforming Singapore complex margins by $3.4 a barrel.&nbsp;GRM for June quarter was&nbsp;$10.5 a barrel.    On the operational front, company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) grew by 2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 21,108 crore. Margin for the quarter stood at 14.7 percent against 16 percent in June quarter.  Other income during the quarter declined nearly 30 percent sequentially to Rs 1,250 crore.  Mukesh Ambani said the financial performance of both Retail and Jio reflect the benefits of scale, technology and operational efficiencies. &amp;quot;Retail business EBITDA has grown three fold on YoY basis whereas Reliance Jio EBITDA has grown nearly 2.5 times.&amp;quot;  Jio has now crossed 250 million subscriber milestone and continues to be the largest mobile data carrier in the world, he added.  Reliance Jio  Reliance Jio's second quarter profit increased to Rs 681 crore in Q2FY19, a growth of 11.3 percent over Rs 612 crore reported in June quarter, driven by consistent addition in subscriber base.  Revenue during the quarter grew by 13.9 percent sequentially to Rs 9,240 crore, the company said, adding subscriber base was 252.3 million as of September 2018.  Average revenue per user for the quarter stood at Rs 131.70 against Rs 134.5 in previous quarter.  Jio's EBITDA in second quarter increased 13.5 percent to Rs 3,573 crore QoQ.  Strategic Investments  Reliance Industries announced strategic investments in and partnership with cable television service operators Den Networks and Hathway Cable.  Hathway Cable  Jio will acquire 51.34 percent stake in&nbsp;Hathway Cable by investing&nbsp;Rs 2,940 crore through a preferential issue.  Hathway Cable will issue 90.8 crore shares to Jio at Rs 32.35 per share.  Den Networks  Reliance Jio will acquire 66.01 percent stake in Den Networks by investing Rs 2,045 crore via a preferential issue and also through a share purchase agreement of Rs 244 crore with the existing promoters.  SkyTran Inc  Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries, acquired 12.7&nbsp;percent shareholding in SkyTran Inc, a US incorporated venture-funded technology company developing state of the art technology in the field of Personal Rapid Transit Systems.  Retail Segment  Retail business registered a healthy 25.3 percent sequential growth (up 121.5 percent YoY) at Rs 32,436 crore in Q2.&nbsp;Accelerated store expansion, strong value proposition and focus on customer experience across all consumption baskets has resulted in this robust growth, RIL said.  Retail EBIT rose 16.4 percent QoQ (up 272.5 percent YoY) to Rs 1,244 crore for the quarter ended September 2018.  Reliance said the outstanding debt as of September 2018 was Rs 2,58,701 crore compared to Rs 218,763 crore as of March 2018. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 2018 were at Rs 76,740 crore against Rs 78,063 crore as of March 2018, it added.  The stock rallied 29 percent during the quarter and gained 26 percent year-to-date. It has, though, corrected nearly 12 percent since August 28, when the market touched record high.  The stock closed at Rs 1,148.90, down Rs 14.75, or 1.27 percent ahead of quarterly earnings announced after market hours.

Macquarie said the primary benefit of this deal would be gaining access to the last mile, and the deal will strengthen the&nbsp;bargaining power of Hathway and Den with regard to broadcasters.  According to CNBC-TV18 reports on October 16 which quoted unnamed sources, Reliance is likely to announce the&nbsp;acquisition of Hathway Cable and Den Networks on October 17.  The board meetings of both companies Hathway Cable and Den Networks is to be held separately on Wednesday, to consider a proposal for raising funds by issuance of equity shares through one or more methods including further public issue/ADR/GDR/qualified institutional placement/preferential issue.  Even the board meeting of Reliance Industries is scheduled Wednesday to announce earnings for the quarter ended September 2018.  Sources told CNBC-TV18 Reliance may buy stakes via fresh equity issuance, which is likely to trigger an open offer for both companies.  The deal will help boost Reliance Jio's GigaFiber services as it expands its subscriber base and this deal is going to add premium customers for Jio improving their ARPU, above mentioned sources said.  CLSA said the absolute investment for acquisition would be small compared to its telecom capex. Reliance invested $35 billion for capex in its telecom business.  The acquisition will help get permissions, but still investment in laying last mile fibre is required, it feels.  Macquarie said the blending of Hathway and Den's cable operations with Jio&rsquo;s plans will be key monitorable going forward.  The research house feels the deal will strengthen the&nbsp;bargaining power of Hathway and Den with regard to broadcasters, but put pressure on urban-focussed DTH operators like Tata Sky and Airtel.

Weakening rupee combined with a surge in the crude oil prices continue to weigh on the market sentiment.  Though it made an attempt to recover in the middle&nbsp;but the decline in global indices worsened the situation in the following session. The final session brought in some relief as participants took note of recovery in rupee and softening crude oil prices on Monday.  All eyes will be on earnings season as some of the big names like Reliance Industries, Infosys, Hero MotoCorp and ACC will announce their numbers during the week along with several others.  We expect further rebound in markets but the upside also seems capped. The Nifty may face hurdles in the 10,550-10,700 zone while 10,100 would continue to act as crucial support.  Having said that, a lot depends on how earnings pan out. Besides, movement in the rupee and performance of global markets will remain on traders&rsquo; radar. We advise investors to keep hedged positions and focusing more on the stock selection.  Here is a list of top three stock which could give 5-8 percent return in the next 1 month:  Lupin&nbsp;: Buy| Target: Rs 950| Stop loss: Rs 845| Return: 7.9 percent  In line with other pharma majors, Lupin also witnessed some decent profit taking and retraced closer to its immediate support around Rs 830.  After spending nearly a week around that zone, it has surged strongly on Monday and completed the formation of fresh buying pivot. We advise initiating fresh longs within Rs 870-880. It closed at Rs 886.8 on October 15, 2018.  Tata Global Beverage&nbsp;: Buy| Target: Rs 248| Stop loss: Rs 220| Return: 6.8 percent  After a strong rally from Rs 110 to Rs 320, Tata Global has been witnessing a correction for the last nine months or so. It has formed a short-term reversal pattern and is likely to witness a breakout from the declining trend line as well.  The positioning of confirmation indicators is also in favour of further surge. We advise using any dip in the range Rs 228-232. It closed at Rs 234.9 on October 15, 2018.  Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro&nbsp;: Sell Futures| Target: Rs 1,155| Stop loss: Rs 1,265| Return: 5.7 percent  L&amp;amp;amp;T has been consolidating in a broader range of Rs 1,200-1,400 for the last eight months and is currently hovering around the lower end of the range.

Revenue is expected to grow robustly at more than 20 percent but due to margin headwinds and extended provisioning requirements of corporate lenders, bottom-line improvement is slow.  For Q2FY19, we expect Nifty companies to report EPS growth of 10 percent. IT, Consumers and global cyclical expected to report healthy numbers while PSU banks, auto and infra to report muted results this quarter.  Automobiles: Revenue growth of 14 percent YoY is expected. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margin is expected to drop on account of rising raw material prices and rupee depreciation. Capacity constraints in 4-wheeler space and competitive intensity in 2-wheeler are added negative.  Infrastructure and capital goods: Slow execution, tightening liquidity and high-interest rates causing stress on working capital of companies. Infrastructure companies may report 25-30 percent sales growth,&nbsp;though&nbsp;the profits may grow by a mere 11 percent.  For capital goods, net profit&nbsp;is expected to decrease by 4 percent, though sales growth of 15 percent is expected for the quarter.  Cement: Volume growths could be at 7 percent for pan-India players and 13-15 percent for companies based in southern India. Petcoke and diesel prices have raised by 5 percent QoQ and imported coal by 9 percent QoQ. These costs will keep net profits growth muted at negative single digit for the industry.  Consumer: Efforts on increasing distribution network will come into play yet again. Volume growth will be backed by sustained rural demand, urban demand recovery and new product launches. Sales growth is expected at 12 percent,&nbsp;EBITDA at 15 percent and profits at 16 percent for the quarter  Healthcare: US sales are expected to stabilise on account of new product launches. Overall sales growth is expected to be at 8 percent while the net profit is expected to decline by 5 percent.  Metals: Buoyant prices will keep sales high,&nbsp;though the volatility in earnings may persist. Sales may grow at 20 percent while net profit is expected grow at 44 percent for the quarter. We expect ferrous companies to report better performance on account of better pricing.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas: Inventory gains and marketing margins are expected to stay healthy. City gas distributors to report a healthy 21 percent sales growth. Reliance may report 52 percent YoY sales growth. ONGC and OIL are expected to witness 45-60 percent growth in EBITDA due to higher realizations.  Technology:&nbsp;The depreciation in rupee will be positive for tech firms. Companies are expected to report an average 22 percent sales and net profit growth for the quarter.  Financials: We may see a&nbsp;healthy advance growth of 25 percent and pre-provisioning profit growth of 12-14 percent&nbsp;in these companies. Though, provisions remain the key component to monitor.  Axis Bank, SBI, Coal India, ONGC, Reliance and Sun Pharma are key contributors to Nifty earnings growth for FY19 and FY20 and thus are the key results to track.

Large telecom operators often borrow funds from the market by issuing bonds of various maturities. If bond yields rise, they would need to pay more interest on the securities they issue.  Since a lot of these companies also borrow from overseas markets&nbsp;regularly,&nbsp;the weakening of the rupee will increase their cost of borrowing in those markets, thereby eroding the benefit they enjoy of raising money from abroad.  &amp;quot;The days of freebies for mobile consumers may be finally coming to an end as the high cost of money is definitely hurting telcos and putting pressure, particularly on the incumbents, which should lead to some tariff hikes in the next two quarters,&amp;quot; Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice-President, Markets and Corporate Affairs, IIFL, told&nbsp;the paper.  Industry experts also believe that mobile tariffs may go up in the next two quarters given that consumption is surging, the cost of diesel is rising and the rupee is weakening.  However, Rajan Mathews, Director General of the Cellular Operators Association of India, observed that fierce competition&nbsp;will likely force telcos to keep tariffs largely unchanged for the next two-to-three quarters.  Reliance Industries-controlled Reliance&nbsp;Jio Infocomm,&nbsp;which has kept tariffs largely unchanged since January, entered the market in September 2016 with competitive prices, pushing other telecom operators to drop rates, analysts told the paper.  While the move benefited subscribers, it weeded out smaller carriers and to consolidated the industry&nbsp;to three large private players -- Vodafone&nbsp;Idea, Bharti Airtel and&nbsp;Jio -- making it an ideal market situation for pricing power to return over time, they said.  Telecom operators may now have to redesign some of their less-popular bundled offers and induce customers to upgrade to higher-value deals for the same amount of data and free voice calls,&nbsp;Bhasin was quoted as saying.  He added that operators could also 'selectively ring in modest increases in monthly rentals of some bundled packs' to boost overall revenue.

Timely apt decisions (a series of them) from the govt/RBI could help in turning around the sentiments in the bond and equity markets even as one hopes that the global situation does not worsen much in the near term.  While the Indian markets are now much cheaper than a month back, analysts will have to rework their earnings estimates based on the recent developments locally and across the globe.

However, oil consumption will still increase to 480 million tonnes by 2040 as the renewable push will not completely halt oil demand growth, he said, citing official statistics.  To meet that consumption, India has been boosting its overall refining capacity with first production from its upcoming West Coast refinery expected in 2022.  India has plans to add 190 million tonnes per year of refining capacity over the next 10 years to its existing 228 million tonnes per years, he said.  &amp;quot;Over a period of time, some additional refining capacity would also come and some of the exports which are happening through the private sector will probably get curtailed and would get consumed in the country itself,&amp;quot; he said.

",,"Business, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance-permanently-shuts-down-ma-oil-fieldkg-d6-block_11452361.html,"Reliance Industries Friday said it has permanently shut down its only oil field in the flagging KG-D6 block after production declined to nil. Reliance Industries (RIL) had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.  &amp;quot;This is to inform that MA (D26) field in Block KG-DWN-98/3 (KGD6), which is being operated by RIL as an operator of the joint venture consisting of RIL (60 per cent), BP (30 per cent) and NIKO (10 per cent), has ceased production on September 17, 2018,&amp;quot; the company said in a regulatory filing.  Post-cessation, activities related to the safe shutdown of the field are underway.  &amp;quot;Production from the field had been under natural decline and facing continuous challenges due to high water production and sand ingress. The field has cumulatively produced about 0.53 trillion cubic feet of gas and 31.4 million barrel of oil and condensate and had no remaining reserves,&amp;quot; the company said.  For Q1 FY19, MA field contributed less than 0.1 per cent in terms of revenue at RIL consolidated level.  RIL said the Dhirubhai-26 (D26) oil, gas and condensate deep-water discovery was made in 2006. The discovery was developed and put on production in September 2008.  This was India's first deepwater development (water depth up to 1,250 metres), with seven wells tied back through a sub-sea production system to a purpose-built, state of the art dis-connectable turret moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) production facility.  &amp;quot;Relevant governmental agencies have already been informed,&amp;quot; it added.  The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).  Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in April-June quarter this year.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic meter per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 and D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.  Output, thereafter, has only declined.  KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 and D3 and MA fields.The shutdown of the MA field coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a FPSO unit, which processes output from the field.  Reliance is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.  RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.  The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.

The box will provide about 600 channels along with other contents such as movies, songs, etc. The box will connect to large-sized televisions and will be capable of dishing out contents in ultra-high 4K resolution.  Why is Jio GigaFiber so important?  Although Reliance Jio is not the first to provide broadband connection through optical fibre cables, it is one of the first to provide the last mile connectivity.  To explain in simple terms, majority of existing internet service providers (ISPs) who provide optical fibre-based broadband services are either FTTB (fiber-to-the-building) or FTTP (fiber-to-the-premises) where the optical fibre reaches only a common distribution node (box) in the building or premises. Hereafter, data is transmitted to the user's house using traditional copper cables which severely cripple high speed data transfer abilities.  However, with FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) broadband service, Jio GigaFiber will ensure that even the last few metres, colloquially known as last-mile, will be connected using fibre optic cable, thereby ensuring a user receives high broadband speeds at all time.  Moreover, Jio is a known disruptor and one can rest assured that Jio GigaFiber will bring broadband services at never-seen-before prices. In fact, various reports speculate Jio GigaFiber will provide broadband data at nearly 50-75% cheaper rates than what the existing ISPs are offering.  How to register for Jio GigaFiber?

In perhaps one of its kind intervention in a deepsea field, RIL-BP has, through the use of a combination of complex techniques, kept the wells flowing at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3) gas fields in the Krishna Godavari basin block KG-D6, they said.  RIL-BP want to keep the system live till the R-Series and Satellite fields in KG-D6 block are ready to produce. The due plan to use existing facilities to produce 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of peak output from R-Series, Satellite, and MJ fields.  The D1 and D3 fields, the first of the one-and-a-half dozen gas discoveries in KG-D6 that were brought to production in April 2009, will cease to produce by end-2019.  This shutdown will coincide with upgradation, modification, and preparation of facilities and operating system to connect new fields, sources said adding the R-Series is likely to give first gas in mid-2020 while Satellite and MJ field may begin output in 2021 and 2022.  The partners, they said, have spent over Rs 7000 crore in sustaining production from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields, which otherwise would have ceased to produce much earlier. D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 witnessed higher than anticipated and sooner than expected sand and water ingress that led to choking of wells after wells since the second half of 2010.  D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 are at the tail-end of their production life and they are being kept alive to preserve the facility for use by the new production from the three projects, sources said.  Besides costing money to first preserve the facilities in case of an early shut-down and later reuse it, a shutdown could have created problems as the system would be idle for too long in the deepwater, they said adding inlet pressure has been delicately reduced to levels where multiple wells could be kept flowing.  Besides, surfactant is being used to lift water from the wells and gas from MA field is being recirculated to keep the line packed and help lift the gas from the remaining fields.  This, they said, can last for only another year -- at which point the quantity of gas will be so low, water production will be beyond what the system can manage, and the pressure will be depleted that no more gas can be produced.  Reliance had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. D1 and D3 fields went onstream in April 2009.  MA field cessation expected by September 2018, sources said, adding that the field at its peak had produced 1,08,418 tonnes of oil in May 2010.  Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in the April-June quarter.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 mmscmd in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.  Output thereafter has only declined.  KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 and MA fields.  RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.  RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.  The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum of 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

The three member panel by a majority of 2-1 also awarded USD 8.3 million compensation to the three partners, Reliance said in a regulatory filing.  &amp;quot;An international arbitration panel has issued an award in favour of Reliance, BP &amp;amp;amp; Niko (Consortium) rejecting completely the claims of the Government of India against the Consortium in respect of migrated gas, by a majority of 2 to 1,&amp;quot; it said.  All the contentions of the Consortium have been upheld by the majority with a finding that the Consortium was entitled to produce all gas from its contract area and all claims made by the Government of India have been rejected, it said adding the Consortium is not liable to pay any amount to the Government of India.  &amp;quot;The Tribunal also awarded costs of USD 8.3 million (Rs. 56.44 crore) to be paid by the Government of India to the Consortium,&amp;quot; reliance said.  The panel headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Lawrence Boo rejected the government's demand that Reliance and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources pay for &amp;quot;unfairly&amp;quot; producing natural gas belonging to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).  Boo, a professor at universities in China, Australia and Singapore, and head of the Singapore-based Arbitration Chambers, was last year appointed as president of the tribunal by its two other members -- government's arbitrator and former Supreme Court Judge G S Singhvi and Reliance-appointed arbitrator, former English High Court Justice Bernard Eder.  The oil ministry on November 4, 2016, slapped a demand of USD 1.47 billion on Reliance-BP-Niko combine for producing in seven years ending March 31, 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from ONGC's blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal.  After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on Reliance, BP and Niko.  At the time, Reliance disputed the government's demand as being based on a &amp;quot;misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC,&amp;quot; and it said that such a demand was without precedent in the oil and gas industry. It on November 11, 2016, slapped an arbitration notice.  Reliance is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources.  The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee. The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016, report, concluded that there has been &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to the production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML.  It relied on a report produced by petroleum industry consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton which concluded that gas had migrated from ONGC-controlled parts of the sea floor and the geological formations beneath it into areas controlled by the private companies. But Reliance had at that time stated that the methods were flawed.  The government, sources said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from Reliance-BP-Niko for &amp;quot;the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained&amp;quot;.  So, a notice was sent, they said, adding that the government is also pressing Reliance to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than the target.  The cost recovery issue is being arbitrated separately.  Originally, ONGC had sued Reliance for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of Reliance.  Under the direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah, however, said the compensation should go to the government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.

As of the June 2018 quarter, the Mukesh Ambani-led company had an outstanding debt of Rs 2,42,116 crore, which rose from Rs 2,18,763 crore from March 2018, while cash in hand marginally rose to Rs 79,492 crore.  The company had spent around Rs 22,000 crore in capex during the quarter mostly into the still cash-burning telecom venture, and reported a net income of Rs 9,459 crore.  Its outstanding debt has been rising as its fledgling telecom business continues to drain cash.  &amp;quot;We are planning to raise USD 2.7 billion in forex debt through the course of the fiscal 2019. The money will be raised in multiple tranches and will be used to refinance some of our existing high cost forex debt,&amp;quot; a senior company official told PTI over the weekend refusing to reveal more information.  More than half of Reliances around USD 34 billion debt is due for repayment by 2022, while around USD 13 billion is maturing from 2018 through 2020. Most of the outstanding debt is denominated in foreign currencies.  Reliance has sought shareholders approval to issue redeemable non-convertible debentures at its July 5 AGM, it said in its annual report.  Due to the high rating at BBB+ (by S&amp;amp;amp;P Global Ratings) which is two notches higher than the sovereign rating, Reliance can raise cheaper funds. Moodys has a Baa2 rating on the company, a notch above the governments rating.  Reliance is the only private sector company in the country that has issued perpetual bonds to foreign investors a few years back. The only other domestic entity to tap the perpetual bond market is the state-run State Bank of India.  According to investment bankers, Reliances repayments from 2018 through 2020 will be its biggest for any three-year period in the past and include about USD 8.14 billion term loans, USD 3.52 billion bonds and a USD 300 million revolver loan. It also has about USD 1.65 billion in interest payments.  In the June 2018 quarter its finance cost jumped more than threefold to Rs 3555 crore on an annualised basis.  The retail-to-refining giant debt has trebled over the past five years as it invested a whopping USD 37 billion in a telecom venture and to bolster its traditional petrochemicals business which included a pet coke gasification unit and in expanding petrochemicals capacities.  Telecom is still cash burning having sucked in around Rs 22,000 crore in the June quarter.  During the recent AGM, the billionaire owner Ambani, who is the richest Asian, said his vision for the group was to become a consumer company over the next decade. Already, 31 per cent of its revenue is coming from retail and telecom business as per its June quarter numbers.  In the June quarter, Jio, was launched just two years ago, had reported a net income of Rs 612 crore, while the market leader Airtel had plunged into a whopping Rs 980 crore loss from its domestic operations. Jio with it loads of cheap data offering, entry has crippled the once-sun-shine telecom market.  The record net income in the June quarter was led by bumper earnings from retail business, improved profitability of telecom arm and near-doubling of earnings from petrochemical business offset lower margins from oil refining business.  Consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore was 17.9 per cent higher than Rs 8,021 crore that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate had netted and exclude a Rs 1,087 crore exceptional income from the sale of a stake in Gulf Africa Petroleum Corp. Revenue rose 56.5 per cent at Rs 1,41,699 crore thanks to the spike in oil prices.

Reliance had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009.  &amp;quot;MA field cessation expected by September 2018,&amp;quot; the company said in an investor presentation post announcing first-quarter earnings.  The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from the upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).  Output has been declining since then it produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in April-June quarter, Reliance said in the presentation.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 &amp;amp;amp; D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic meter per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.  Output thereafter has only declined.  Reliance said KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This was made up of production from both D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 and MA fields.  In April the company had stated that &amp;quot;adhering to Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted Bank Guarantee for Decommissioning activity for existing producing fields&amp;quot;.  While the company had not provided any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields then, it has now said MA field would shut in September.  The shutdown coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field.  Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 percent interest, while BP plc of UK holds 30 percent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 percent.  The government's Site Restoration Guidelines provide for a one year notice for decommissioning of facilities.  Reliance had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of USD 8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest USD 2.234 billion, which was scaled down to USD 1.96 billion in 2012.  The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decades time.  RIL in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries -- R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in the KG-D6 block at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak output. Initial gas will start flowing from 2020.

Refining margins were soft, in line with global trends, but record volumes in the petrochemical segment more than compensated for it. Retail too saw yet another quarter of robust growth.  Jio continued to post strong revenue growth, along with an improvement in operating profitability during the quarter.    Segment wise performance      Petrochemicals &ndash; record performance   Petchem segment reported record earnings with a 58 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in realizations and a stellar 95 percent YoY uptick in profitability. Margins improved 370 basis points YoY. The strong performance was driven by 1) robust 35 percent increase in volumes 2) improved realization with uptick in crude 3) commissioning and stabilization of the refinery of gas cracker unit (ROGC) and its downstream units 4) improved polyester margins 5) stable polymer margins 6) rapid growth in domestic demand for petchem products 7) globally improving product prices  Refining &ndash; lower refining margin in line with global trend    Refining contributes more than two third of the group&rsquo;s revenues. Performance was slightly tepid during the quarter with gross refining margins (GRM) at $10.5 per &nbsp;barrel (bbl) (Q1FY18: $11.9/bbl). However, the softness was in line with weak global GRMs, but a good $4.5/bbl above the Singapore benchmark margins. While revenue increased 43 percent YoY, earnings before interest and taxes (excluding exceptional items) declined 17 percent due to 1) weakness in gross refining margins 2) lower crude throughput 3) adverse movement in Brent-Dubai differentials 4) weak gasoline prices due to higher inventory across the globe and higher exports from China due to low internal growth.  Retail downstream oil business reported strong growth during the quarter with 25 percent YoY increase in gasoline volumes. The company now plans to re-commission fuel outlets in order to drive further volume growth.  Oil and Gas &ndash; earning erosion continues  The upstream oil and gas segment saw improved realization with an 8 percent YoY growth in revenue due to rapid uptick in the oil and gas prices globally. However with declining volumes in both domestic (down 11.8 percent) and US shale (down 26.6 percent), the segment EBIT continued to be negative. Incremental production from the CBM block neutralized the dip in production from the KG D6 basin. The company now plans to start monetizing its KG D6 block and drilling work has started in July.  Retail &ndash; expanding rapidly  Rapid store expansion, coupled with improved customer engagement processes across all segment, helped the retail segments top-line grow 123 percent YoY during the quarter, despite a high base last year. Margins improved 160 basis points led by emphasis on cost control initiatives and benefits of operating leverage owing to additional stores.  &nbsp;Fashion - Aggressive store expansion, loyalty programmes, tie-ups with leading foreign apparel brands, foray into the mothercare category, online sales (through AJIO), and higher contribution of private labels should help RR consolidate its strengths better.  Grocery &ndash; The quarter saw robust growth across all sub-segments (home and personal care, staples, fruits, vegetables). We believe improved brand visibility with store additions will attract more footfalls and increase volumes.  Reliance Digital &ndash; The company plans to undertake integration of its existing 305 physical digital stores with new &lsquo;Jio Points&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reliance ResQ&rsquo; (the service arm) centres which would help further widen the customer base in the upcoming quarters.  Jio &ndash; continues capturing the market  Jio&rsquo;s operating revenues revenue rose 13.8 percent YoY to Rs 8,109 crore (up 13.8 percent quarter-on-quarter). The division added 28.7 million net subscribers over the last quarter, expanding the subscriber base to 215.3 million at the end of June 2017. Jio achieved a subscriber base of 200 million within 21 months of starting operations.  Despite strong competition, Jio&rsquo;s ARPU (average revenue per user) witnessed a marginal dip of 1.9 percent QoQ. (Airtel posted a decline of 9.5 percent).    Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA margins expanded 100 bps to 38.8 percent, a commendable achievement. This was helped by a reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 15 percent of revenues from operations to 13 percent in this quarter (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) cut interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).  Outlook   Post the end of an aggressive capex cycle, RIL is now in a sweet spot. Most of its projects are in the monetization phase, and this will boost cash flows in quarter ahead, in turn improving operating efficiencies. The overall macro environment is also quite conducive for the various verticals where the company has exposure.  With full commissioning of the refinery off gas cracker plant, the petchem segment reported a strong growth which is expected to continue and further grow given the rapidly growing domestic demand. With higher vertical integrations, we expect margins in this segment to expand.  The company is now focused on aggressively expanding the retail consumer business presence. We expect the stellar performance to continue and margins to improve further with increasing volumes.  We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of significant capacity, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India.

Also, net profit on Jio was also a beat because most of the experts were anticipating a profit figure of sub-600.  &ldquo;The stocks will get re-rated and I would not be surprised if it even surpasses Rs 1200 on Monday,&rdquo; he said.  Here is a list of top 10 takeaways from RIL Q1 results:  Net Profit:  The Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas major, RIL reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,485 crore for the quarter ended June 30 which was slightly lower than a CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 9,570 crore.  Total Revenue:  Consolidated revenue during the quarter increased 10.1 percent sequentially to Rs 1.29 lakh crore, backed by growth across the board.  Increase in revenue is primarily on account of higher realizations of refining and petrochemical products led by 49 percent YoY increase in Brent oil price. &ldquo;Increased revenues also reflect higher volumes with start-up and stabilization of petrochemicals projects,&rdquo; said the release.  Operating Profit:  Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 64.6 percent to Rs 20,661 crore ($ 3.0 billion) from Rs 12,554 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Record operating performance was led by 33 percent volume growth and significant margin improvement in petrochemicals business, said the release.  GRMs:  Gross refining margin, or what the company earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, came in at $10.5 per barrel which was in-line with a CNBC-TV18 poll of $10.85/bbl.  Reliance Jio:  Reliance telecom venture Reliance Jio reported a net profit of Rs 612 crore for the quarter ended June which was higher than a CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 567 crore. Reliance Jio reported a net profit of Rs 510 crore in the previous quarter.

The net subscriber addition for the Company during the past twelve months has been 92 million, which was the highest in the industry by a substantial margin.  Petrochemical Business:  1Q FY19 revenue from the Petrochemicals segment increased by 58.2 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 40,287 crore ($ 5.9 billion) due to 35 percent increase in volumes and about 24 percent higher realizations. Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level of Rs 7,857 crore ($ 1.1 billion) supported by strong YoY volume growth led by successful stabilization of the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC, its downstream units, and PX-4.  The sharp increase in segment performance also reflects improvement across polyester chain margins and stable polymer margins said the press release posted by RIL on exchanges.  Refining Revenue:  1Q FY19 revenue from the Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing segment increased by 42.9 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 95,646 crore ($ 14.0 billion) while Segment EBIT declined by 16.8 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 5,315 crore ($ 776 million).  Lower crude throughput due to the planned turnaround of one Crude distillation unit and softer refining margins led to decline in Segment EBIT on YoY basis. R&amp;amp;amp;M performance was also impacted by higher flat price and adverse movement in Brent-Dubai differentials on a YoY basis.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas Business:  Q1 FY19, revenue for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment increased by 8.2 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 1,432 crore. The increase is predominantly due to higher gas and oil price realisation.  Segment EBIT stood at (447) crore was impacted by lower volumes due to natural decline. On a YoY basis, domestic production declined by 11.8 percent to 17.9 Bcfe and production in US Shale operations declined by 26.6 percent to 28.7 Bcfe.  Organised Retail Business:  Revenue for Q1 FY19 grew by 123.7 percent YoY to Rs 25,890 crore from Rs 11,571 crore. Rapid store expansion along with superior customer value proposition across all consumption baskets supported revenue growth.  The benefits of a strong focus on cost control, scalability and operating leverage is reflecting in 3x EBITDA growth on a Y-o-Y basis. Retail EBIT margin expanded YoY to 4.1 percent.

Financial results of Q1FY19 underscore the strength of the petrochemicals we have reinforced over the last investment cycle,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries said.  Reliance posted gross refining margin for the quarter at $10.50 a barrel against $11 per barrel in the March quarter and $11.9 a barrel in Q1FY18.  &amp;quot;We do not see GRM to be impacted going forward,&amp;quot; Alok Kumar Agarwal, CFO said.  Refining business during the quarter increased 2.3 percent sequentially to Rs 95,646 crore but its EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) fell 5.2 percent to Rs 5,315 crore.  Petrochemical segment in June quarter showed a 5.7 percent sequential growth at Rs 40,287 crore with its EBIT growing sharply by 22.1 percent to Rs 7,857 crore.  Ambani said petrochemicals business generated record EBITDA with strong volumes and an upswing in polyester chain margins. &amp;quot;Refining business performance remained steady despite the seasonal weakness in cracks. Continuing strength in global demand for oil products and implementation of more stringent environmental norms for marine fuels augurs well for our refining business.&amp;quot;  The revenue from its oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment increased 92 percent QoQ to Rs 1,432 crore with narrowing EBIT loss at Rs 447 crore against loss of Rs 600 crore.  Outstanding debt at the end of June quarter stood at Rs 2,42,116 crore ($35.4 billion) compared to Rs 2,18,763 crore as on March, 2018 while its cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 79,492 crore ($11.6 billion) compared to Rs 78,063 crore QoQ.  Consumer Business  Mukesh Ambani said consumer businesses continued to scale new highs and now account for nearly 21 percent of consolidated segment EBITDA.  Retail business revenues have more than doubled and EBITDA has trebled on a YoY basis and Jio added a record number of subscribers, highlighting the compelling technology and value proposition that Jio offers vis-a-vis other networks, he added.  Jio continued its momentum with profit growing 20 percent sequentially to Rs 612 crore for the quarter ended June. Its profit in the March quarter stood at Rs 510 crore.  Revenue from operations grew by 13.8 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 8,109 crore in Q1FY19 with EBITDA rising 16.8 percent to Rs 3,147 crore and margin expansion of 100 basis points at 38.8 percent.  Jio has seen net additions of 28.7 million subscribers during the quarter (which was 8.3 percent higher compared to 26.5 million additions in the March quarter), taking total subscriber base to 215.3 million.  &amp;quot;215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world,&amp;quot; Ambani said, adding the continued strength in financial results of Jio despite competitive intensity reinforces the customer uptake of its services and its strong operating leverage.  Average revenue per user for the quarter came in at Rs 134.50 against Rs 137 in the previous quarter  Voice consumption in Q1 stood at 744 minutes per user per month and average data consumption per user per month was 10.6 GB.  Reliance said digital services revenue during the quarter increased 14.6 percent sequentially to Rs 9,653 crore with its EBIT growing 14.7 percent to Rs 1,715 crore.  Retail business registered a 7.1 percent sequential growth at Rs 25,890 crore with its EBIT rising 12.4 percent to Rs 1,069 crore.  &amp;quot;I don&rsquo;t think anyone expected this kind of EBIT margin and sequential growth. In fact, if one negates deferred tax from the profit before tax (PBT), the numbers are excellent, specifically on the organised retail front. Both petchem and retail are a blast for the company,&rdquo; SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18.  Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital Management feels the stock would get rerated soon and it may start the next week above Rs 1,200.  On Friday, the stock price closed at Rs 1,129.60, up Rs 19.25, or 1.73 percent ahead of earnings announced after market hours.  The scrip price gained 22 percent in 2018 on top of 70.5 percent upside seen in the previous year, majorly backed by Jio performance, stable refining business and consistent growth in petrochemical segment.

Brokerage houses expect the company's petrochemical business to post strong results. Also in focus would be its telecom business Jio.  RIL's stock has rallied 21 percent in 2018 on top of a 70.5 percent surge in the previous year. It is Rs 28 away from its record high of Rs 1,138.25 touched last week.  Here are key factors to watch out for in June quarter earnings:  Profit  Brokerages expect the Mukesh Ambani-owned conglomerate to report stable growth in standalone profit but consolidated profit is expected to get a boost from the Jio business.  &amp;quot;We expect standalone net income to remain stable, as gains from a weaker rupee and modestly higher petchem volumes/margins will likely be offset by lower refining margins,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  The research house expects a&nbsp;modest increase in consolidated profit driven by higher contribution from Jio.  Prabhudas Lilladher expects standalone earnings at around Rs 8,570 crore due to weak refining margins; factored in $11 a barrel. &amp;quot;We have factored in refining thruput at 16.9MTPA (Q4FY18 16.7MTPA). However, firm petrochemical spreads and higher volumes will support petrochemicals earnings.&amp;quot;  Standalone PAT is expected to increase by 6.1 percent YoY to Rs 8,696 crore as the impact from lower GRM will be mitigated by higher petchem volumes and weaker rupee, HDFC Securities said.  Refining business  Gross refining margin (GRM) is expected to be in the range of $10-11 a barrel for the quarter against $11 a barrel in Q4FY18.  The Singapore Complex GRM was down 6 percent YoY (down 13 percent QoQ) to $6 per barrel in Q1FY19 versus $7 per barrel in Q4FY18 and $6.4 per barrel in Q1FY18.  Crude oil price continued to trend upward in April-June quarter Average Brent crude price was up 48 percent YoY and 11 percent QoQ to $74.5 per barrel during the quarter.  Motilal Oswal expects RIL to clock GRM of $10.3/bbl due to slightly weak benchmark (premium of $4.3/bbl) while HDFC Securities expects GRM of $10.8 per barrel during the quarter.  Petrochemical business  All brokerage houses feel the petrochemical business will do well in the quarter.  &amp;quot;Petchem segment is expected to do better, led by healthy petchem deltas and strong volume growth,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said.  Edelweiss said petchem earnings are likely to grow by 6 percent as new capacities ramp up. &amp;quot;We expect continued benefit from US ethane imports and recently commissioned offgas cracker.&amp;quot;  Higher petchem earnings are due to ramp in production from ROGC and Px plants, HDFC Securities feels.  Petrochemical business in Q4FY18 grew by 13 percent QoQ and its EBIT by 11.9 percent QoQ.  Jio  Jio, which clocked standalone net profit at Rs 510 crore in the March quarter, is expected to show good growth again in June quarter.  Kotak estimates Jio's reported profits to increase to Rs 600 crore in Q1FY19 while HDFC Securities expects a revenue growth of 5.4 percent QoQ which would be led by 15 percent subscriber growth to 21.5 crore subscribers and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to grow by 3.4 percent QoQ.  Jio in Q4FY18 had clocked 3.5 percent revenue growth and 3.8 percent EBIT growth QoQ.

The liability is to be split between the three companies in proportion to their stake in the fields. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has 40 percent interest while RIL and Shell hold 30 percent each.  In a written reply in Rajya Sabha, Pradhan said that based on the Final Partial Award (FPA) dated October 12, 2016, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had on May 25, 2017, raised demand for USD 3.8 billion on ONGC, RIL and Shell towards government of India share of profit petroleum and royalty.  RIL and Shell challenged the FPA before the High Court in London. ONGC was not party to the arbitration.  &amp;quot;The High Court, London rejected the petition filed by RIL and Shell on April 16, 2018, except on one issue which was remanded to the Arbitral Tribunal,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;For enforcement of the FPA, Government has filed a petition before the Delhi High Court.&amp;quot;  In December 2010, BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Ltd, which was subsequently acquired by Shell, and RIL, initiated an arbitration against the Government of India (GoI) after a dispute over the state's share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast.  The Arbitration Tribunal gave its FPA on October 12, 2016. RIL and Shell initiated proceedings under English Arbitration Act 1996 to challenge the arbitration award before the English Commercial Court in November 2016.  On May 2, 2018, the Court delivered its final judgment, remitting a significant issue for redetermination by the Tribunal within three months while disposing of eight other issues, RIL had said on May 24.  The Arbitration Tribunal has scheduled a hearing to determine the remitted issue and will thereafter deliver an award, it had said.  It had insisted that before taking up the issue of quantification of liability, the Tribunal has to decide the issue which is remitted by the English court to it.  BG-RIL propose to file an application to the Tribunal for the increase of Cost Recovery Limit which they are entitled to do under the Production Sharing Contracts.  &amp;quot;Tribunal can consider the issue of quantification of liability (if any) only after these two issues are decided,&amp;quot; RIL had said. &amp;quot;Several issues relating to the claim made by GOI are subject to pending arbitration proceedings.&amp;quot;  Pradhan said out of the four arbitration initiated by RIL in respect of its Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6, only two are under adjudication.  The firm has withdrawn the arbitration against a delay in notifying a gas price and the one against taking away of some area in the KG-D6 block after the expiry of stipulated timeframe.  The arbitrations under adjudication include one against the government disallowing certain costs for KG-D6 output not meeting the targets because of non-drilling of stipulated wells, he said.  The second arbitration is against the government seeking compensation from RIL and its partners for producing natural gas belonging to state-owned ONGC, he added.

However, some 60 percent of the August volumes were considered off-specification as the grade does not meet the requirements of the petrochemical industry standard, the traders added.  It is unclear why Reliance's naphtha contains more oxygenates than usual. Reliance officials were not available for immediate comment.  Reliance had offered the long-range tanker size cargo for end-August loading from Sikka Port in western India through a tender which closes on Wednesday.  But the cargo contains 100 parts per million (ppm) of total oxygenates, twice the acceptable amount for making petrochemicals.  The fuel, however, could still be used but only if buyers have the means to lower the oxygenates levels.  Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in western India, has already sold one such cargo with 100 ppm oxygenates to Vitol for early August loading at discounts to Middle East quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.  Traders said the off-specification cargoes came at a time when European naphtha arriving next month in Asia was lower versus July.

The GAs cover 24 percent of the country's area and 29 percent of its population.  The round is likely to attract investments of Rs 70,000 crore, according to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB).  The government is targeting to raise the share of natural gas in primary energy basket to 15 percent from 6 percent at present, within a few years.  The bid round is also aimed at meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of giving piped cooking gas connection to 1 crore households, roughly triple the current size, by 2020.  The CGD licenses on offer are for Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh; Ahmednagar in Maharashtra; Ludhiana and Jalandhar in Punjab; Barmer, Alwar and Kota in Rajasthan; Coimbatore and Salem in Tamil Nadu; Allahabad, Faizabad, Amethi and Rai Bareli in Uttar Pradesh; Dehradun in Uttarakhand and Burdwan in West Bengal.  Prior to the 9th round, 91 GAs were awarded to firms like Indraprastha Gas Ltd and GAIL Gas Ltd, which are serving 240 million population, 42 lakh domestic consumers and 31 lakh CNG vehicles.  Of these, 56 GAs were awarded through bidding rounds and the rest on government nomination.  The bid round is being held on changed parameters after one paisa bids spoilt the initial auction rounds.  Bidders have been asked to quote the number of CNG stations to be set up and the number of domestic cooking gas connections to be given in the first eight years of operation.  In the previous eight rounds, bidders were asked to quote only the tariff for the pipeline that carries gas within the city limits. These bidding criteria did not include the rate at which an entity would sell CNG to automobiles or piped natural gas to households using the same pipeline network, leading to companies offering one paisa as the tariff to win licenses.  In the new guidelines, maximum weightage of 50 percent has been given to the number of piped gas connections proposed in eight years from the date of authorisation, as compared to 30 percent earlier.  The number of CNG dispensing stations proposed to be set up has been assigned 20 percent weightage. Length of the pipeline to be laid in the GA and the tariff proposed for city gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has been assigned 10 percent weightage each.  Also, a floor tariff of Rs 30 for city gas and Rs 2 per kg for CNG has been put in order to deter bidders from quoting unviable tariff of 1 paisa per unit.  Companies having a net worth of not less than Rs 150 crore can bid for cities with a population of 50 lakh and more while the same for cities with the population of 20 lakh to 50 lakh has been proposed at Rs 100 crore.  The net worth eligibility goes down with population, with a Rs 5 crore net worth firm being eligible to bid for cities that have less than 10 lakh population.  Last few rounds of CGD have evoked a lukewarm response. The fourth round was altogether canceled, while the fifth saw a sparse response.  The sixth round of bidding for 34 cities in 2015 got bids for only 20. The seventh round of bidding done to set up CGD infrastructure in 11 smart cities under smart city mission received only 1 bid.  Seven cities were offered in the 8th round last year but not all cities have been awarded so far.

The numbers bear out Ambani&rsquo;s words. In just a year, the contribution of RIL&rsquo;s consumer-facing businesses of retail and telecom jumped to 13 percent at the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) level from a mere 2 percent.  Given RIL&rsquo;s wherewithal and its unmatched ability to play the game of scale, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Ambani&rsquo;s announcements on fixed line broadband and new commerce platform are added to its list of game-changing executions.  RIL arm Reliance Jio Infocomm now has 215 million customers with 25 million of them also using its JioPhone. All this within 22 months of its launch. What Jio has accomplished in telecom in a small period of existence will be a subject for historians and economists alike to study in years to come.  Technology will be at the core of RIL&rsquo;s transition, spelt out several times by Ambani in his over-an-hour-long speech at the company&rsquo;s 41st&nbsp;annual general meeting today. In doing so, the company also looks set to disrupt not just one industry this time but several &ndash; retail, direct-to-home, cable TV, fixed line broadband, home accessories and what have you.  Come July 21 and customers would be able to buy a JioPhone for just Rs 501 in exchange for their old feature phone. And August 15 will see at least a couple of launches.  JioPhone2, an affordable high-end smartphone, will be available from the day of India&rsquo;s independence. But this could just be a precursor to a launch that could revolutionise India&rsquo;s fixed broadband market where the country ranks 134 in the world.  Jio, from August 15, will start taking booking for its fixed-line broadband services, dubbed JioGigaFiber. The offering, relying on Jio&rsquo;s vast fiber optic cables spread over thousands of kilometres, will bring to users broadband speeds in excess of 1 Gbps, something unheard of in India.  The company will also launch JioGigaRouter and JioGiga Set Top Box to bring over 600 TV channels to consumers. If calling on WhatsApp is still a matter of surprise for you, wait for Jio to bring TV-to-TV calling. That too will be a reality soon, promised Ambani&rsquo;s daughter Isha who also addressed the audience.  The company also has plans to launch various smart devices to control the lighting and appliances in your homes.  RIL also aims to combine the best of the technology that it has deployed -- 4G VOLTE &ndash; with the sheer physical magnitude of its retail business.  Reliance Retail now has over 7,500 stores across 4,400 cities &ndash; 4,000 of those outlets coming up only in the year gone by. Its stores recorded 35-crore footfalls last year. Reliance Trends, India&rsquo;s largest fashion retailer, sells over 33,000 garments every hour. Reliance Fresh sold over 500,000 tonnes of groceries in 2017-18. Reliance Retail has the largest portfolio of 41 international brands.  Reliance now aims to combine the physical and digital marketplaces under what Ambani called Bharat-India Jodo enterprise &ndash; helping 3 crore small merchants and shopkeepers come on its digital platform.  &ldquo;We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio's digital infrastructure and services&hellip;We see merchants and small shop owners as critical customer interaction and fulfilment points, who will share a mutually beneficial win-win relationship with us,&rdquo; Ambani said.  RIL aims to deploy merchant point of sale for small shop owners, enabling them to do everything that large enterprises and large e-commerce players are able to do.  The small shopkeepers will be able to manage inventory, keep digital records and file returns, improve working capital management, retain and upgrade customers, access new customers, run promotion and loyalty programmes, link to RIL&rsquo;s highly efficient supply chain, and much more.  These may be announcements or stated intentions for now. But trust RIL to concretise them. Some facts Ambani stated bear that out again.  While a major part of Ambani&rsquo;s speech was devoted to Jio, he also spoke on how RIL&rsquo;s traditional businesses of refining and petrochemicals continue to set records.  The company has successfully commissioned and stabilised the world's largest paraxylene complex at Jamnagar. Today, Reliance is the second largest paraxylene producer in the world and Jamnagar has the distinction of being the largest manufacturing facility of paraxylene in the world with 4.2 million tonne capacity. At 2 billion units, it is also the largest recycler of PET bottles in India.  &ldquo;All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business,&rdquo; Ambani said. Surely, when record-setting in cut-throat businesses is so predictable at RIL, the predictability that an annuity business will bring can only be welcomed.

Having made India the largest data consumer in 2017, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries has now set his sights on putting India among the top five fixed broadband markets in the world. India currently ranks 134 in fixed line broadband services with the quality and speed of services leaving much to be desired.  Addressing the shareholders at the 41st annual general meeting of India&rsquo;s largest private sector company, Ambani said RIL arm Reliance Jio Infocomm would, August 15 onwards, begin to take bookings for its soon-to-be-launched superfast fixed line broadband service. Interested users can register their names via Jio.com or MyJio app.  The company will roll out JioGigaFiber services in 1,100 cities simultaneously with the number of registrations in a given city deciding the priority of launch, Ambani said.  JioGigaFiber will have speeds in excess of gigabits per second. Existing broadband service providers struggle to provide broadband at 20 Mbps in the national capital though some claim to have speed of 100 Mbps. 1 Gbps is equal to 1,000 Mbps. The company is targeting 5 crore JioGigaHomes in the first phase.  Clearly, JioGigaFiber could disrupt the fixed broadband market and its pricing in much the same manner that Jio&rsquo;s 4G VOLTE mobile services did, making voice calls almost free and taking data prices to one-tenth of their then prevailing levels.  After announcing the launch of JioGigaFiber, Ambani stepped aside for a while to let his daughter Isha, son Akash and Reliance Jio Director Kiran Thomas address the audience. Isha said the three most popular apps&nbsp;&mdash; WhatsApp, YouTube and Facebook&nbsp;&mdash; will be available on JioPhone from August 15.  She also announced the launch of JioPhone2, a premium version of the popular smartphone JioPhone that has already notched up 25 million users.&nbsp;JioPhone2 will be an affordable high-end mobile with a horizontal screen display. It will be retailed for Rs 2,999 from August 15.  Aiming to increase the affordability of JioPhone and bring it to more users, Isha said users will be able to buy new JioPhone by exchanging their existing feature phone for a mere Rs 501 from July 21. The company has called the scheme &lsquo;JioPhone Monsoon Hungama&rsquo;.  Ambani has set a target of 100 million JioPhone users in the &ldquo;shortest possible time&rdquo;.  Delivering the superfast broadband services to homes would be the JioGigaRouter. JioGigaFiber services will also allow TV-to-TV calling within the comfort of homes. The company will also launch JioGigaRouter to deliver over 600 channels to TV.  In the world of Netflix, all this will undoubtedly cause major disruption in the not-so-flexible direct-to-home and cable TV markets and not just the fixed line broadband segment.  The company will also launch Jio Smart Home Accessories like sensors to detect and regulate water leak, temperature, lighting and electrical appliances.

RIL, or Reliance Industries Limited, led by Mukesh Ambani, shared its numbers today.  The company announced a host of new decisions that could impact many sectors across the economy.  Let&rsquo;s do a quick check on what has been said so far.  Reliance Industries Limited held its 41st Annual general meeting today. Mint had noted last year that RIL&rsquo;s annual shareholder meetings have always seemed like a big fat Indian wedding.    Everyone wants to go and grab a bite. Considering that RIL is credited with kicking off an equity culture in India that seems a fair assessment.  Besides, Reliance has rewarded shareholders generously over the years. Mr Ambani noted at last year&rsquo;s AGM that if a person had invested Rs 1,000 invested in his company back in 1977, that amount would have been worth Rs 16.5 lakh in 2017.  And since this is Reliance, let&rsquo;s look at the scale of the meeting. RIL has approximately 2.4 million retail shareholders. 33 years ago, in 1985, 12,000 shareholders attended the Reliance AGM in Mumbai. In 1986, that number shot up to 35,000. Last year, 2000 people attended while most people watched the proceedings over the internet, especially the chairman&rsquo;s speech. Also, shareholders received a 1:1 bonus offer.  RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani noted the conglomerate&rsquo;s continued success and remarked that it is going through a golden decade. Ambani said, &ldquo;...profits are up by 20.6% to Rs 36,075.crore (for FY18). Reliance has reached an inflexion point.&amp;quot; He mentioned that Jio and the Retail business&rsquo; share in overall EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization, has risen from 2% to 13%.  In last year&rsquo;s AGM, telecom arm JIO took centre stage, with Ambani&rsquo;s heirs, son Akash and daughter Isha launching the new Jio phone. There was a near spectacle, with a display of the trailer for the film Bahubali 2 thrown in as well.  This year, the company continued with its trend of making big announcements related to telecom. Jio, which was launched in 2016, has taken the Indian mobile telephony market by storm. Jio&rsquo;s with attractive offers, or outrageous if you are the competition, forced massive price revisions by rival companies.  The newcomer made a profit of approximately Rs 510 crore for the fourth quarter. It had logged a profit of Rs 504 crore in the October-December quarter.  In today&rsquo;s meeting, Ambani noted that Reliance Industries is India's largest payer of GST, excise and customs duty as well as income tax. He claimed Reliance Jio has doubled its customer base in less than two years to 215 million users, a feat he said no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world. Voice usage data shows that Reliance Jio clocks 530 crore minutes per day.  He made another announcement that could well trigger another price war: the commercial launch of JioGigaFiber. This is RIL&rsquo;s fiber-based broadband connectivity on which the company made an investment of Rs 2,50,000 crore. Isha Ambani, daughter of the chairman, summed it up thus: &ldquo;Gone are the days of Mbps, now it will about Gbps.&rdquo;  What&rsquo;s more, RIL is calling this FTTH, or Fiber to the home. In simpler terms, your fiber internet connection reaches only till the premises, after which copper cables are used for the last stretch of the connection.  his affects your connection speed. RIL claims it will provide fiber all the way to your individual building. Reliance will make its GigaFiber service available in 1,100 cities and towns across the country and will be adding new users starting August 15th. If you are one for beta-testing such a network, well, Reliance is currently running beta trials on &lsquo;tens of thousands of homes for the JioGigaFiber.&rsquo; If you want to sign up, head over to Jio.com.  Not surprisingly, Dalal Street saw some heartburn as shares of cable TV service providers fell when Reliance announced the launch of JioGigaFiber. Bloomberg noted that Hathway Cable fell 4.13 percent, Den Networks went down 5.4 percent and SITI networks was down 2.9 percent.  And that&rsquo;s not all regarding data. Looks like Reliance is betting big on data consumption. Mukesh Ambani shared that data usage increased to 240 crore GB per month from 125 crore. Video consumption increased to 340 crore hours per month from 165 crore hours per month.  The other marquee announcement today was the Jio Phone 2. The new phone will be higher-end compared to last year&rsquo;s Jio phone. It will feature horizontal screen viewing and a QWERTY keypad. The phone will cost Rs 2,999 and will also feature Facebook, YouTube and WhatsApp.&nbsp; Existing Jio users, who now number around 25 million, can upgrade to the new phone by paying just 501 rupees.  Mukesh Ambani added that, &ldquo;All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business.&rdquo;  With the showpieces done, the AGM moved to other RIL businesses like retail, entertainment and hydrocarbon.  Speaking about Reliance retail, the group&rsquo;s chairman said &amp;quot;Reliance market has been creating value for small merchants.&amp;quot; Over 350 million footfalls were received by 7,500 Reliance retail stores over the last year.  And more than 4,000 new stores were launched last year. He claimed Reliance Trendz is the largest apparel seller in India while the ubiquitous Reliance Digital has become the largest retailer of electronics and digital products in India.  He also spoke about leveraging Jio&rsquo;s success to help grow Reliance&rsquo;s retail business. The Bharat-India Jodo programme is expected to integrate Reliance Retail with Reliance Jio. Ambani said, &ldquo;We see the maximum scope in creating a unique online-to-offline platform. This will be done by combining the resources of Reliance Retail and Jio's digital infrastructure.&rdquo;  He also added that Jio has enabled the company reinvent itself as a tech platform. These, he said, have become new age factories. The hybrid model, it is claimed, will offer value for money to consumers and integrate pharmacies, small groceries etc.  Moving to the entertainment sector, Mr Ambani said Reliance Industries now runs one of the country&rsquo;s largest media and entertainment networks - One in five internet users in India are on Network18's websites and one in two people watch its TV channels.. He added that it is the partner of choice for any foreign media company operating in India.&nbsp; Ambani also said digital tools will predict and anticipate customer needs.  Speaking about RIL&rsquo;s hydrocarbon and refinery businesses, the chairman said the group has commissioned the largest paraxylene complex in the world with a capacity of 4.2 million metric tonnes. Reliance is the second largest paraxylene producer in the world and Jamnagar in Gujarat is its largest facility. Speaking about the year ahead, Ambani said RIL is committed to becoming one of the largest recyclers of plastic and polymers, for instance PET bottles.  Another big move the RIL is looking at is the commissioning of the world's largest coke gasification project. This is geared towards eliminating its dependence on imported natural gas. He also spoke about the RIL-BP joint venture seeking opportunities to market gas in India. The company has set itself a target to begin gas production by 2020 and reach full production of 30-35 MMSCMD gas production in India by 2022.  The impact of Reliance&rsquo;s 41st AGM remains to be seen. But, as of now, Bloomberg reports that shares of the company erased gains and fell 0.98 percent to Rs 980.40 after the shareholders' meet ended.

Most analysts&rsquo; feel the same way about the stock price as well, which rose a little over 7 percent in 2018.  As the Golden Decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses, Mukesh Ambani said addressing the shareholders.  Reliance continues to be India's largest exporter accounting for 8.9 percent of India's total merchandise exports with a value of Rs 176,117 crore with access to markets in 113 countries.  The speech has something for everyone. The big takeaway is that most of the business of RIL are contributing to its growth story and plans to foray into e-commerce business in agriculture, education, and healthcare.  The big announcement of advanced fiber-based broadband connectivity service called JioGigaFibre sent shivers in the telecom as well as Cable TV space. Mukesh Ambani says the new fibre service will redefine 24/7 emergency help for all homes across India.  The stock has risen a little over 7 percent in 2018 but analysts&rsquo; feel that there is plenty of growth left for the long-term investors. Although it may remain in a range in the next 12 months or so.  &amp;quot;RIL's profits are up by 20.6 percent to Rs 36,075.crore in FY18. Reliance has reached an inflection point,&amp;quot; Ambani said addressing shareholders at the 41st AGM. He added that Reliance Jio and Retail's share in overall EBITDA has gone up from 2 percent earlier to 13 percent now.  Jio has doubled its customer base to 215 million users within 22 months since the official launch of the network which is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world.  &ldquo;RIL provided a detailed presentation on Jio citing its vision for Jio over the next few years. Significant growth in subscriber base to 215mn and robust jump in data and voice usage are commendable,&rdquo; Sudeep Anand, Head-Institutional Equity Research at IDBI Capital told Moneycontrol.  &ldquo;The company&rsquo;s strategy to go aggressive on FTH (Fibre-to-home) business along with connecting enterprise business are likely to drive growth for the company. The company is targeting 100 mn Reliance Jio phone users, 5mn FTH subscribers and 50mn households with broadband and other services,&rdquo; he said.  Also, Reliance disclosed its plan for e-commerce business in 3 main platforms 1) agriculture, 2) education and 3) healthcare. Though it provides a positive outlook but difficult to pen any numbers as of now, but Anand is quite optimistic about the future of Jio and RIL as a whole. IDBI Capital maintains a buy rating with a target price of Rs1,150.  In the last one year, Jio has achieved unprecedented growth starting with an already existing large base. The data usage has grown from 125 crore GBs per month to more than 240 crore GBs per month.  Jio is the world's largest mobile data network last year and the gap from the others has only widened in the last 12 months. The voice usage on the network has grown from 250 crore minutes per day to more than 530 crore minutes per day.  RIL plans to foray into three new platforms vis. Agriculture, education, as well as healthcare. Mukesh Ambani further added that as India starts on its high growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period.  &ldquo;Launch of Jio was just a trailer, the array of services which Reliance now wants to deliver/cross-sell to the last mile consumers are huge and varied across many sectors which hitherto are serviced by brick and motor establishments,&rdquo; says Jimeet Modi, Founder &amp;amp;amp; CEO, SAMCO Securities &amp;amp;amp; StockNote who has a target of Rs 1050-900 on RIL for next 12 months.  &ldquo;These will now be catered through Jio&rsquo;s digital platform. The philosophy of forwarding integration in data is the next mission of Jio. This will truly bring in digital revolution if they are able to implement and execute the same,&rdquo; he said.  Reliance started with backward integration in Refinery by later venturing into hydro carbon sector, but in digital it is the reverse.  Hydrocarbon Business:  RIL has successfully commissioned and stabilized the world's largest Paraxylene complex. Reliance is the second largest PX producer in the world and Jamnagar has the distinction of being the largest manufacturing facility of PX in the world with 4.2 million MT of capacity.  Speaking at the AGM, Mukesh Ambani said that we commissioned the largest off-Gas cracker complex in the world. Using our Refinery off-gasses as feedstock, this cracker is the most cost competitive ethylene cracker, globally.  &ldquo;This positions us uniquely, as one of the most efficient producers of Polymers in the world. I am proud to report that both these projects have been completed in a record time frame, at world-beating capital productivity and commissioned flawlessly,&rdquo; he said. &amp;quot;Both the Paraxylene and Cracker complexes are already running substantially higher than their design capacity.&amp;quot;  &ldquo;The core downstream projects are largely on track with Paraxylene and RoGC already running above the design capacity and petcoke gasification project now fully stabilized. We have Buy rating on Reliance Industries,&rdquo; Abhijeet Bora, analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

He was addressing the company&rsquo;s shareholders at its 41st Annual General Meeting.  The oil-to-telecom conglomerate posted consolidated revenues of Rs 430,731 crore in 2017-18 and a profit after tax of Rs 36,075 crore.  &ldquo;As India starts on its high growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period.

Key takeaways from CMD Mukesh Ambani's speech  The contribution of RIL&rsquo;s consumer businesses of retail and mobility rose to 13 percent at the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) level, up from 2 percent in merely a year.  The company is banking on telecom, retail and the online-to-offline new commerce platform to achieve its target of doubling revenues in 8 years.  Addressing his shareholders, Ambani laid out a vision for the company which he said would transition to become a technology platform company.  He said the company would ride on technology to also spearhead initiatives in agriculture, education and health, the three key sectors that he had also mentioned in his last AGM speech.&nbsp; Ambani said the company would create more such platforms to create societal value.  RIL AGM Highlights: Looking to shift from a cyclical to annuity business, says Mukesh Ambani  &ldquo;Our digital connectivity platform has served as the foundation on which we are building our new commerce platform, our media and entertainment platform, education platform, healthcare platform and agriculture platform. Going forward, we shall build more such platforms,&rdquo; he said.  Ambani also reaffirmed the group&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the environment. He said environment regulation is now a global imperative, a fact reflected in the company being the largest recycler of PET in India. The company recycles over 2 billion PET bottles annually.  &ldquo;We are committed to becoming a leader in the emerging circular economy and to become one of the largest recyclers of plastics in India. All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business,&rdquo; Ambani said.  JIO DIGITAL  A major part of Ambani&rsquo;s speech was devoted to Reliance Jio. The RIL Chairman said the company would continue to increase the affordability of its digital network for the common man.  After disrupting the mobile call and data market in less than 22 months, Ambani said the company is now set to cause ripples in the fixed-line broadband market. The RIL Chairman said he aims to put India among the five largest consumers of fixed-line broadband services.  Full text of&nbsp;speech&nbsp;by Mukesh Ambani  The company has been credited with making India the largest consumer of mobile data services in the world in 2017, jumping from 150th rank in less than a year.&nbsp; Reliance Jio now has 225 million users, a feat achieved within 22 months of its launch.  RIL is looking to increasingly become a part of everyday life. The company also announced that it will launch Jio Smart Home Accessories like sensors to detect and regulate water leak, temperature, lighting, electrical appliances.  INDEPENDENCE DAY LAUNCHES  Ambani said the company will start taking bookings for its much-awaited fixed line broadband &lsquo;JioGigaFiber&rsquo; services from August 15. People can register for the services via Jio.com and MyJio app. The service will not just bring high-speed broadband services but also will enable homes to become smart, allowing devices to communicate with each other.  The company will roll out JioGigaFiber services in 1,100 cities simultaneously with the number of registrations deciding the priority of launch in a given city, Ambani said. The company is targeting 5 crore JioGigaHomes in the first phase.  He said the company does not need to make fresh investments in its soon-to-be-launched JioGigaFiber services, having already invested Rs 250,000 crore to create a world-class digital infrastructure that spans 4G LTE and optic fiber network for mobility and fixed-line broadband businesses.  After announcing the launch of JioGigaFiber, Ambani stepped aside for a while to let his daughter Isha, son Akash and Reliance Jio Director Kiran Thomas address the audience. Isha said the three most popular apps &ndash; Whatsapp, YouTube and Facebook &ndash; will be available on JioPhone from August 15.  She also announced the launch of JioPhone2, a premium version of the popular smartphone JioPhone that has already notched up 25 million users.    JioPhone will be retailed for Rs 2,999 from August 15. Aiming to increase the affordability of JioPhone and bring it to more users, Isha said users will be able to buy JioPhone by exchanging their existing feature phone for a mere Rs 501 from July 21. The company has called the scheme 'JioPhone Monsoon Hungama'.  &ldquo;With the added functionalities, our wider network reach across India and strong retail presence across India, the goal that I have now set for our Jio team is to enable 100 million users on this JioPhone platform in the shortest possible time,&rdquo; Ambani said on his return to address his over 2.2 million shareholders.  NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM  Ambani also spoke passionately about creating a hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform.  &ldquo;We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio's digital infrastructure and services,&rdquo; Ambani said.  The platform will bring together the 35 crore customer footfalls at Reliance Retail stores, the 21.5 crore Jio users, the targeted 5 crore Jio Giga Homes and the 3 crore small merchants and shop-keepers all over India who provide the last-mile physical market connectivity.  &ldquo;Hence, we will integrate the physical and digital marketplaces in a uniquely collaborative Bharat-India jodo enterprise,&rdquo; the RIL CMD said.

The AGM will begin at 11 am&nbsp;at Birla Matushri Sabhagar, 19, Sir Vithaldas Thackersey Marg, near Bombay Hospital&nbsp;and&nbsp;Medical Research Centre, in Mumbai.  For the last few years, RIL has made massive Jio-related announcements during the AGM and the trend is expected to continue. Not to forget, the highly-anticipated JioPhone was launched at the same event last year, which was made available for a refundable deposit of Rs 1,500.  Reports suggest that RIL could well announce the commercial launch and prices for its broadband venture, JioFiber service.  So what is JioFiber and how is it different from other broadband connections?  JioFiber is the latest offering from Jio for your home. It offers ultimate broadband experience to surf, stream, game and work, because of its ultra-fast upload and download speeds&nbsp;and&nbsp;effective functioning in merely &amp;quot;milli seconds&amp;quot;.  JioFiber connectivity comes directly to your home unlike in most cases where the fiber reaches only until the building and the last few meters of end connectivity is done using the traditional cable which drastically reduces the speed and user experience due to patches and inferior cable qualities of such patch up.  The current offer as listed on the Jio website is the JioFiber preview offer which gives you ultra high-speed internet up to 100Mbps for 90 days along with a monthly data quota of 100 GB and a complimentary access to a host of Jio's premium apps.  Highlights from March quarter results:  Reliance Industries reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,459 crore for the March quarter, up 17 percent compared to the same quarter of the previous year.  Consolidated quarterly revenues stood at Rs 1.29 lakh crore, up 39 percent quarter on quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 5 percent, QoQ, to Rs 18,469 crore, and the operating margin was 15.8 percent.  Jio has continued its strong subscriber growth trend with net addition during the quarter of 26.5 mn and its total count reached to 186 million. Higher competition has capped ARPU to Rs 137 which resulted in lower revenue of Rs 8,421 crore.  Most brokerages have highlighted that the results have largely been in line with estimates, but have raised target prices up to Rs 1,200.

The owner of world's largest oil refining complex will also make low-cost and high-volume composite products like modular toilets, homes and composites for windmill blades and rotor blades.  Without giving investment details, Reliance in its latest annual report said it has developed capabilities for 3D printing of wide-range of plastic and metals products.  Reliance is developing new business verticals in the petrochemicals business to capture Rs 30,000 crore composites market and has plans to produce graphene, enhanced plastics and elastomers, fiber reinforced composites which can replace steel.  A composite is an engineered material made from two or more ingredients with significantly differing properties, either physical or chemical. One of the most common forms of composite in use today is carbon fiber.  It is made by heating lengths of rayon, pitch or other types of fiber to extremely high temperatures in an oxygen-deprived oven. The resultant rayon strands are spun into a thread, then woven into sheets and mixed with hardening resins to form the various components needed.  &amp;quot;RIL is investing in India's first and largest carbon fiber production line with its own technology &ndash; to cater to India's aerospace and defence needs as well as the specialty industrial applications,&amp;quot; it said.  It had last year acquired the assets of Kemrock Industries to enter the composites business and is focusing on thermoset composites such as glass and carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRPs).  &amp;quot;The ability to deliver exceptional strength (similar to or better than steel) at a significantly lower weight is a critical performance attribute of FRPs. Additionally, FRPs can withstand harsh weather, have a long life with minimal maintenance, are corrosion resistant and can be moulded into any shape,&amp;quot; it said.  Composites are used in a wide range of markets and applications: industrial, railways, renewable energy, defence and aerospace.  &amp;quot;RIL expects the newly launched Reliance Composites Solutions (RCS) business to be the No. 1 composites player in India,&amp;quot; the company said.  Stating that it will focus on design and specifications driven markets and applications that have the potential to grant better returns, it said the focus areas include wind mill blades and parts for railways and metros, which have exacting standards of performance and safety (especially fire retardant).  Also on the radar are carbon wraps to rehabilitate/refurbish India's old infrastructure &ndash; bridges, buildings (for improved seismic performance) and pipes.  &amp;quot;RCS will design and administer low-cost and high-volume products such as modular toilets and homes to support the Swachh Bharat Mission, disaster relief measures and Housing for All programmes initiated by the Indian Government,&amp;quot; the annual report said.

Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day &amp;quot;wind-down&amp;quot; period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day &amp;quot;wind-down period&amp;quot; ending on Nov. 4.  India has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions but companies with links to the U.S. financial system could be liable to penalties if they do not comply.  Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others.  Reliance, whose modern refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, has told officials of the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) that the firm would stop oil imports from Tehran in October or November, one of the sources said.  A second source said the company could halt imports from Iran earlier than that if European nations and Tehran failed to salvage the nuclear deal.  This source said that some insurance companies have asked Reliance to end exposure to Iran before November.  Global insurers have already warned about doing business with Iran while some shipping lines have said they would not take new bookings for Iran.  The United States has threatened to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran.  In the interim period until it stops buying Iranian oil, Reliance has asked NIOC to supply Iranian oil in vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), the sources said.  The sources did not wish to be identified as the matter is sensitive. Reliance did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.  In 2017, Reliance's oil imports from Iran surged by about 45 percent to 67,000 bpd, according to ship tracking data. In Jan-April 2018, the company has imported about 96,000 bpd.  RETHINKING DEALINGS  Washington's withdrawal from the nuclear deal has spurred global insurers and other companies to rethink their dealings in Iran as they await further guidance from the United States and European Union.  Earlier this month French energy giant Total said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions.  Italy's Eni, which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, has said it had no plans for new projects in Iran.  Reliance, which deals with some of the top-notch foreign bankers with huge exposure to the U.S. financial system, exports fuel to the United States and imports ethane from there for its petrochemical plants.  Trade sources have said Reliance recently bought up to 8 million barrels of U.S. crude.  After a gap of six years, Reliance resumed purchases from Iran in 2016 when Western powers eased restrictions on trade with Iran in return for the OPEC member agreeing to end its disputed nuclear programme.  During previous sanctions NIOC waived a condition for its oil buyers to open letters of credit.  Since the lifting of sanctions, it has been selling oil in euros, a move that has allowed companies to temporarily continue dealing with Iran, despite the U.S. move to reimpose sanctions.  Iran is also offering deep discounts on sales to recoup market share in Asia, lost to key rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq.  The company's global depository receipts are traded in the U.S. market. It is also the first Asian company to float 50- and 100-year bonds on the U.S. debt market, according to its annual report.

The approval, given based on the recommendations of an expert panel, is subject to compliance of certain conditions, the official said.  The proposal is to expand the gas cracker and downstream plants located at Nagothane village in Raigad district by way of debottlenecking, expansion and change of fuel in captive power plant (CPP) along with expansion and rebuilding of residential township.  The cost of the proposed project, expected to be commissioned in stages, is estimated to be Rs 2,338 crore, the official added. As per the proposal, no additional land and manpower is required for the proposed project.  It has 744 hectare land and 1,794 manpower at present. The company manufactures wide range of products such as Ethylene Oxide, Ethylene Glycol, Linear Low Density High Density Polyethylene (LLHDPE), Hexene-1 and others along with a gas-based CPP.  Presently, RIL Nagothane uses a mixture of ethane and propane to produce downstream products and by-products. The proposal is to modify its feedstock ratio in its gas cracker plant owing to availability of imported shale gas ethane.  With the proposed change in feedstock mixture resulting in higher production of ethylene, the company wants to expand the capacities of downstream products/by-products to accommodate the increased ethyelene production.  That apart, the company has proposed to enhance CPP capacity from 85 mw to 100 mw by way of refurbishing and also use ethane as a fuel owing to its economic viability and availability. Further, the proposed project also includes expansion of the existing township with additional residential apartments within the township area.

We believe the company is strongly placed after the aggressive capex done by it.  Most of its projects have started delivering which would give a boost to its cash flow boost in upcoming years along with improved return ratios. We would look it as a long-term India story of diversification rather than watching its results on&nbsp;QoQ basis.  We like the performance shown by the company in FY18 and especially petchem segment and JIO operations. In a short span of time, the company has gained 45 percent subs market share in mobile broadband segment. Jio, which with 186.6 million subscribers is the world's largest and fastest growing mobile data network, saw profits rise to Rs 510 crore, up 1.2 percent over third quarter earnings.  Though Jio started operations in September 2016 with free voice and data offering, 2017-18 was first full year of its financial reporting. Despite low-cost mobile services, Jio posted the highest average revenue per user in the industry at Rs 137.1 per month during the reported quarter.  Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Airtel reported average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 116 for the quarter, down by 26.7 percent from Rs 158 it had registered a year ago. We believe, Jio will play a crucial role in earnings growth.  In Q4FY18, the company&rsquo;s revenue stood at Rs 129120 crore, an increase of 39 percent compared to Rs 92889 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Exports (including deemed exports) from India during the January-March 2018 quarter were higher by 32.5 percent at Rs 51295&nbsp;crore (USD 7.9 billion) as against Rs 8718&nbsp;crore in the corresponding period of the previous year due to higher volumes and product prices in refining and petrochemical business.  Increase in consolidated revenue was primarily on account of volume increase with starting up of petrochemicals projects and oil price-related increase in realisations for refining and petrochemical products.  Higher interest and depreciation charges with the commissioning of projects across businesses, however, resulted in relatively lower growth in profit after tax (PAT). The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9435 billion for the quarter ending March 31 (Q4) on the back of improved performance of its petrochemical and retail businesses.  The profit was largely in line with street estimates and represents a 17.3 percent increase over Rs 8046 billion reported in the year ago quarter. Earnings from the refining and marketing business took a hit, with a 10.9 percent year-on-year decline in its earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) for the March 2018 quarter.  The company said, the fall was largely on account of reduced crude throughput and adverse move in Brent-Dubai crude oil price differentials.  The company&rsquo;s petrochemical segment witnessed robust performance which improved overall profitability. Petchem business registered a topline growth of 13 percent led by a mix of higher prices for products along with higher volumes especially in paraxylene and ROGC (refinery of gas cracker). EBIT growth of 12 percent was driven by strong margins from polypropylene, PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and downstream polyester products. With the full commissioning of the refinery off cracker plant, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business which is already posting good growth.  Reliance Jio Infocom reported its second quarterly net profit at Rs 510 crore, marginally up from the preceding quarter ended December when the telecommunications subsidiary showed a profit for the first time at Rs 504 crore. For 2017-18, the Jio operations reported a PAT Rs 723&nbsp;crore against a loss of Rs 3.1 crore in 2016-17.  RIL&rsquo;s gross refining margin (GRM) was down marginally at USD 11 a barrel for the quarter from USD 11.6 in the previous quarter.  For the full year of 2017-18, RIL recorded consolidated revenue of Rs 4,30731 crore, an increase of 30.5 percent, compared to Rs 3,30180&nbsp;crore in the previous year.  The company&rsquo;s topline was also boosted by robust growth in the retail and digital services businesses. Robust growth of 134 percent in its retail business and continuing growth momentum in wireless subscriber additions for digital services business supported its topline. The company&rsquo;s plans to further expand its consumer retail presence in every format which would further drive profitability in the coming years.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, RIL, said, &ldquo;The year (2017-18) was a landmark year for Reliance, where we established several records on both operating and financial parameters. Reliance has become the first Indian company to record PBDIT (profit before depreciation, interest and tax) of over $10 billion with each of our key businesses &mdash; refining, petrochemicals, retail and digital services achieving record earnings performance. Substantial synergies, productivity gains and production growth in our energy and materials business have allowed us to perform at very competitive levels despite the uptrend in oil prices through the year.&rdquo;  Increase in petroleum product prices were led by 18 percent year-on-year increase in brent oil price to USD 57.5 a barrel. The company also announced that it plans to shut oil and gas production at its main fields in KG-D6 block in the coming months and begin complying with the government&rsquo;s guidelines for decommissioning facilities in the Bay of Bengal block where output has hit its lowest ever.

While we expected a healthy performance from petrochemicals (petchem) and digital segments, what came as a surprise was the phenomenal topline and profit growth from retail.

Also Read: Top 10 takeaways from Reliance Industries' Q4 results&nbsp;  While the fiscal had started on a slow note, Q2FY18 saw strong traction driven by high growth in the polymer and polyester demand which helped the company touch its highest-ever production levels. With all major projects now fully commissioned, the upcoming year is expected to witness strong growth with high volumes and management has guided to stability&nbsp;in margins.    Though substantially outperforming the benchmark Singapore GRM of USD 7 per billion barrel (bbl), the GRM at USD 11 per bbl remained slightly below expectation. Higher crude prices facilitated the 30 percent increase in the&nbsp;top line,&nbsp;however, the adverse move in Brent-Dubai differentials and reduced crude throughput led to a decline in the segment EBIT. Volumes grew almost 42 percent in the 1,313 fuel outlets across the country.  Oil demand grew on the back of global demand upswing led largely by the aviation, gasoline and diesel verticals. Domestic demand remained close to 1.6 million barrels (mbl) per day during FY18, much above the expected levels of 1.3 mbl. In FY19, demand is expected to stay steady around 1.5 mbl, which would facilitate growth in the segment and improve margins.  Organized retail &ndash; a positive surprise  The results from the organized retail segment came as a positive surprise with a phenomenal 134 percent topline growth during the quarter along with almost a 300 percent growth in EBIT led by expanding scale, and operational efficiencies. Volumes grew across consumer baskets and traction in this segment marks the overall expanding presence of the company&rsquo;s consumer portfolio. RIL plans to further expand its consumer retail presence in every format which would further drive profitability in the coming years. Strong traction in this high-margin business will be worth watching out for.  Upstream Oil segment &ndash; less erosion with high crude prices  Upstream performance remained near flattish with an overall decline in production. The crude oil price continued its upward trend in 4QFY18, up 24 percent YoY, which helped to make up for a portion of the loss. Ramping up of the CBM operation and the commencement of the upstream gas production would be some key developments in the future.  Jio &ndash; keeping strong  Jio reported revenue from operations of Rs 7,128 crores (up 3.6 percent quarter on quarter) and added 26.5 million net subscribers over the last quarter, bringing the subscriber base to 186.6 million at the end of March 2017.  The company continued to follow its strategy of capturing subscriber base aggressively even if it meant lower ARPU (average revenue per user). The strategy resulted in a strong sequential growth of 16.6 percent in its net subscriber base whereas its ARPU declined by 11 percent and stood at Rs 137.1 per month, still much better than what Bharti Airtel, the market leader, reported (Rs 116).    In terms of operating margin, Jio reported a minor contraction of 40bps in its EBITDA margin, which came at 37.8 percent, respectable nevertheless. The contraction was primarily due to the&nbsp;reduction in tariff to maintain the price difference with the incumbents. This got partially offset by the reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 15.7 percent of revenues from operations to 15.0 percent in this quarter (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) reduced interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).  What next?  After the end of an aggressive capex cycle, RIL now stands at a sweet spot where most of its projects have started delivering. The company is likely to see a big cash flow boost in upcoming years along with enhanced operating efficiencies and an uptick in the return ratios. The overall macro environment also stands quite conducive to the various verticals where the company has exposure.  With the full commissioning of the refinery off cracker plant, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business which is already posting good growth.  We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of significant capacity, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India.

The consolidated net profit rose by 17.3 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 9,459 crore or $1.14 billion which was almost similar to a CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 9,498 crore.  The stock which rose to a record high ahead of the results closed 2.1 percent higher to Rs 996.30. It hit a record high of 1011 and a low of 985.50. The stock rose nearly 6 percent so far in the year 2018 and by about 39 percent in the last one year.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman, and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said: &ldquo;FY 2017-18 was a landmark year for Reliance where we established several records on both operating and financial parameters. Reliance has become the first Indian company to record PBDIT of over US$ 10 billion with each of our key businesses - Refining, Petrochemicals, Retail and Digital Services achieving record earnings performance.  &amp;quot;Substantial synergies, productivity gains and production growth in our energy and materials business have allowed us to perform at very competitive levels despite the uptrend in oil prices through the year,&amp;quot; he said.  We have collated a list of top 10 takeaways from RIL Q4 results:  Total revenue:  RIL achieved revenue of Rs 129,120 crore ($ 19.8 billion), an increase of 39 percent as compared to Rs 92,889 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Increase in revenue is primarily on account of volume increase with the start-up of petrochemicals projects and oil price related increase in realizations for refining and petrochemical products.  The increase in consolidated revenues reflects the robust growth of 134% in Retail business and continuing growth momentum in wireless subscriber additions for Digital Services business.  Operating Profit:  Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 51 percent to Rs18,469 crore ($ 2.8billion) from Rs12,233 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  The strong operating performance was driven by growth in Petrochemicals, Retail, and Digital Services businesses. This was partially offset by the reduced contribution from refining due to lower crude throughput, and lower volumes in upstream oil &amp;amp;amp; gas.  Outstanding Debt:  Outstanding debt as on 31st March 2018 was Rs218,763 crore ($ 33.6 billion) compared to Rs196,601 crore as on 31st March 2017.  Reliance Jio:  Jio has continued its strong subscriber growth trend with net addition during the quarter of 26.5 million (as against 21.5 million in the previous quarter). The standalone revenue from operations stood at Rs7,128 crore, which translates into a growth of 3.6 percent on a QoQ basis. The standalone net profit of Rs510 crore.  Organized Retail Business:  Revenue for 4Q FY18 grew by 134.1 percent on a YoY basis to Rs24,183 crore from Rs10,332 crore. Reliance Retail witnessed stellar performance across all consumption baskets during the period.  The business delivered strong PBDIT of Rs1,086 crore in 4Q FY18 as against Rs352 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. During the quarter, Reliance Retail added 86 stores across various store concepts and strengthened its distribution network for consumer electronics.  Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing Business:  Revenue from the Refining &amp;amp;amp; Marketing segment for 4Q FY18 increased by 29.8 percent on a YoY basis to Rs93,519 crore led by 24.2 percent YoY higher crude oil prices during the quarter.  Segment EBIT declined by 10.9 percent on a YoY basis to Rs5,607 crore ($ 860 million), largely on account of reduced crude throughput and adverse move in Brent-Dubai differentials.  Gross Refining Margins (GRMs):  GRM, a gauge for regional refining margins for the year was at a 9-year high of $11.6/bbl as against $11/bbl in the previous year. GRM is the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products  RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex margins by $4.4/bbl. As at the end of the year, RIL operated 1,313 petroleum retail outlets in the country.  Petrochemicals Business  Revenue from the Petrochemicals segment in 4Q FY18 increased by 43.9 percent on a YoY basis to Rs38,113 crore due to higher volumes and prices. Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level of Rs6,435 crore supported by strong volume growth, higher margins for Polypropylene, downstream polyester products and fibre intermediate products.  This was partially offset by lower deltas in elastomers and Polyethylene. Volume growth was led by successful stabilization of the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC and its downstream units.  Oil and Gas (Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production) Business:  Revenue for the Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas segment for 4Q FY18 decreased by 43 percent on a YoY basis to a Rs746 crore. Segment EBIT was at (600) crore as against (486) crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  The segment performance continues to be impacted by declining volumes. Domestic production was lower at 18.4 Bcfe, down 17.5 percent on a YoY basis whereas production in US Shale operations declined by 13.6% to 32.4 Bcfe.  KG-D6:  KG-D6 field produced 0.167 million barrels of crude oil and 13.7 BCF of natural gas in 4Q FY18, both were lower by 41 percent on a year-on-year basis. Fall in oil and gas production was mainly on account of natural decline coupled with underperformance and shutdown of wells due to water and sand ingress.

The company&nbsp;&nbsp;is expected to report a net profit of Rs 9,635.2 crore for the March quarter, an increase of 2.25 percent quarter-on-quarter and 19.8 percent year-on-year, according to average of estimates of analysts polled by Reuters.  Reliance, India's second largest company by market capitalisation, will&nbsp;&nbsp;report its fourth quarter earnings&nbsp; on April 27.  Apart from petrochemical and refinery businesses, the telecom segment is closely watched by the Street. The telecom segment had posted a profit in the December quarter.  Ahead of earnings Thursday, the stock price closed half a percent higher at Rs 975.35 amid high volumes. The shares shed 4 percent in the last quarter of FY18 after a 17 percent rally in the preceding quarter and a 34 percent rally in the whole of FY18.  The Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani Group company is also going to consider and recommend dividend on equity shares on Friday.  Here are&nbsp;the key factors to watch out for in its earnings:  Reuters Poll  Profit after tax for the quarter is expected at Rs 9,635.2 crore, an increase of 2.25 percent quarter-on-quarter and 19.8 percent year-on-year. Operating income is seen rising 2.6 percent QoQ and 38.2 percent YoY to Rs 18,043.6 crore.  Petrochemical Business  Petrochemical business, which contributed 24 percent to gross revenue and reported 20.5 percent sequential growth in Q3 (more than 47 percent growth YoY), is likely to continue to perform strong in the March quarter as well due to capacity expansion and higher volumes, analysts said.  &amp;quot;Petchem segment is expected to do better due to healthy deltas and strong volume growth in the segment,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said in a report. Broker KR Choksey also expects the petchem segment to perform well owing to improved margins supported by a strong volume growth in production at 8.1 MMT (up 30.6 percent YoY, 1.3 percent QoQ).  Edelweiss Securities said petchem earnings are likely to improve 11 percent as new capacities ramp up in addition to robust cracker and polymer margins. It expects continued benefit from US ethane imports and off-gas projects.  Petchem revenue stood at Rs 33,726 crore in the December quarter against Rs 27,999 crore in September quarter, with EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) growth of 16 percent QoQ (up 73 percent YoY) at Rs 5,753 crore in Q3FY18.  &amp;quot;Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level supported by strong volume growth, higher margins for Polypropylene and downstream polyester products. The volume growth was led by the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC coming on-stream along with downstream LDPE, LLDPE and MEG plants,&amp;quot; RIL had said in its filing.  Refinery Business  Gross refining margin (GRM) is another key point to watch out for in the March quarter.  &amp;quot;Singapore complex GRM stood at USD 7 a barrel in Q4FY18 versus USD 7.3 a barrel in Q3FY18 and USD 6.4 in Q4FY17. We expect marginal inventory gain during the quarter. Average Brent crude price was up 24 percent YoY and 9 percent QoQ to USD 67 a barrel,&amp;quot; Motilal Oswal said while expecting the Reliance to clock GRM of USD 11.4 a barrel, led by strong benchmark (premium of USD 4.4 a barrel).  Analysts have&nbsp;factored a GRM in the range of USD 11 to USD 11.6 a barrel in their expectations. KR Choksey's estimate of USD 13.7 dollar is an outlier.&nbsp;The broker has&nbsp;a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,600 per share.  Gross refining margin was USD 11.6 a barrel in December quarter 2017 against USD 12 a barrel in September quarter and USD 10.8 a barrel in December quarter 2016.  Refining business, which contributed more than 50 percent to total revenue, grew by 8.7 percent QoQ and 23 percent YoY to Rs 75,865 crore in December quarter with EBIT falling 6.9 percent QoQ and 0.5 percent YoY.  Telecom  Analysts will also be closely watching the performance of the telecom arm Jio, after the business reported its first ever quarterly profit within six months of starting commercial operations. Segment profit stood at Rs 504 crore in the December quarter against loss of Rs 271 crore in September quarter.  Reliance Jio added around 190 million subscribers in March quarter against 160 million in December quarter.  Motilal Oswal said positive developments in the telecom business would drive growth further for the company and core segment performance is expected to be strong going forward.  Operating revenue of its telecom business increased 11.9 percent sequentially to Rs 6,879 crore with EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 82.1 percent at Rs 2,628 crore and with margin improvement of 1,470 basis points at 38.2 percent in Q3FY18. Its EBIT grew by 453.1 percent QoQ to Rs 1,436 crore.  Other Factors  Also of interest will the retail business, which contributed 13 percent to gross revenue. This segment it had reported 28.3 percent sequential growth (up 116.4 YoY) in revenue in December quarter with EBIT growing 45.8 percent QoQ and 110.8 percent YoY.  &amp;quot;Retail business is also doing well with high double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA,&amp;quot; Sharekhan said.  Overall the performance of shale gas business (that had reported loss in December quarter), petchem margins, progress on remaining core expansions and update on telecom business will&nbsp; be monitored by the Street.

The research body has done a deep study of the socio-economic impact of the Reliance Industries subsidiary. In its 34-page study, the agency points out how prior to Jio&rsquo;s entry in September 2016, the internet usage in India remained low even as its penetration rose.  Talking about the internet usage since 2000, the study says that while global internet traffic in peta bytes per month increased at an annual average growth rate of 30 per cent, the country&rsquo;s internet consumption lagged with a 21.7 per cent rise. But come Jio and all that changed as the company launched affordable data plans besides making voice free on its 4G LTE network.  &ldquo;It is a significant feat for a country that was ranked 155 in terms of mobile broadband penetration in 2015 to become the highest mobile broadband data consumer globally in 2017,&rdquo; the report says.  The escalation in data demand has mainly occurred because of an increase in its affordability. The price of 1 GB of data, which was Rs 375 in 2012 had merely halved to Rs 152 in 2016. But Jio&rsquo;s entry and enhanced levels of competition took prices down by 15 times to Rs 10 in 2017. The data implosion has been to the extent that India now uses 100 crore GB of data each month as compared to 20 crore GB earlier, the study reveals.  &ldquo;It can, thus, be said that Jio has reinvented and reimagined the entire telecom market with its innovative product offering,&rdquo; the Institute says commending the RIL unit.  The launch of the Rs 1,500 JioPhone last year has only accelerated the pace of increase in data usage as increased affordability brings internet to more people.  Institute for Competitiveness goes on to reveal a startling impact of Reliance Jio on the country&rsquo;s economy. It pegs the yearly savings of the entire economy due to a rise in affordability of data prices at a whopping $10 billion.  The study credits Jio&rsquo;s direct physical presence in all 29 states and partnerships with telecom infrastructure companies for its feat. The company&rsquo;s &ldquo;most sophisticated, efficient and largest LTE network&rdquo; covers more than 18,000 urban and rural towns and over 2,00,000 villages in the country.  The company has undertaken extensive research to build the network and filed 54 global patents over the course of this development.  &ldquo;Using the network, Jio aims to usher in an era of &ldquo;visuality&rdquo;, where video will replace voice as the new communication medium. Therefore, Jio has successfully boosted the productivity all across its value chain beginning with infrastructure development to product delivery to consumer usage itself,&rdquo; the research outfit says in its report.

BP India is expecting nearly 10 percent of BP's global earning to flow from India considering the growing energy demand and plans to&nbsp;invest in cutting-edge renewable and alternate energy technologies,&nbsp;Sashi Mukundan, BP Group&rsquo;s regional president and head of India told the paper. The firm's total earning in FY17 jumped more than double from the previous year to stand at USD 6.2 billion. The company has been investing in the Indian market. BP has invested more than USD 8 billion in India in the past seven years. Nearly 95 percent of its investment, or USD 7 billion, has been directed towards exploration and production. BP India is also working to boost&nbsp;its production along with its partner Reliance Industries (RIL) to produce 10 percent of India&rsquo;s total gas demand by 2022. The company partners RIL in four hydrocarbon blocks in the country which include &mdash; KG D6, R-Series, D55 and NEC 25, in the Mahanadi basin. &amp;quot;By 2022, we will have all three projects (KG D6, R-Series, D55 ) up and running and we should get to our peak production by 2023 with around 30-35 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd). That&rsquo;s a billion cubic feet of gas a day and if you look at the forecast for gas demand in India, that is about 10 percent of India&rsquo;s gas demand by 2022,&amp;quot; Mukundan said. India is the&nbsp;third largest energy consumer in the world after China and the US, however, the energy demand is likely to rise. With the economic expansion in the country, more people would gain access to power, cooking gas and personal transport that would push&nbsp;India&rsquo;s energy demand. To meet&nbsp;the increasing energy demand, India is planning to increase the proportion of gas usage in its energy mix to 15 percent from the current 6.5 percent. The world, on an average, consumes 24 percent of gas in the total energy consumption.  Both the firms &mdash; BP and RIL &mdash; will be starting natural gas production from the R-Series gas field in the KG-D6 block, where BP holds 33.33 percent stake, in Bay of Bengal by 2020. They are also planning to start&nbsp;gas production from other fields will start by 2021. In 2017, both the firms had announced plans to invest over Rs 40,000 crore in their hydrocarbon blocks. &ldquo;With the government having allowed a higher gas price of USD 6.78 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) for gas finds in deep water, RIL and BP have decided to work on developing these blocks. This rate is better than the current rate of USD 3.06 per mBtu for fields producing currently,&rdquo; an analyst tracking RIL told the paper on condition of anonymity.

The current trend is largely due to the move we have seen in last week.  The positive close last week with a reversal pattern on weekly chart concluded the ground for short-term term bulls. The follow-up buying has now provided short-term term support with price action establishing itself above 200 days MA and this is the half battle done.  With previous week the sentiments pertaining to the overall global trade war fear that may further push markets down was seen cooling off and breadth was one important indicator that improved lately.  Despite domestic cues turning to be all against the banking sector, we have seen a decent short covering in PSU and private banks. There may be some short-term swings but the overall structure for leading indices looks bullish.  A break of the channel on a closing basis in short-term will give us further confirmation of the upward momentum on a sustainable basis. With that, we are also witnessing 50 percent retracement to be providing the psychological support.  We expect next upside resistance to be around 10,350 and 10,380 which comes to be our immediate short-term targets. Bank Nifty is also showing some positive signs of reversal and as far as we are above 24,200 in that index, we expect prices to retrace higher.

This was revealed by Ambani, the richest Indian, in his acceptance speech last night after his oil-to-telecom conglomerate, Reliance Industries was presented with the 'Drivers of Change' award at the Financial Times ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards.  Since the idea first cropped up, Reliance, which owns and operates the world's largest single location refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat, has spent more than USD 31 billion to break into India's mobile-phone market. The 2016 upstart, called Jio, dislodged rivals and has emerged as the nation's No. 4 carrier by offering call services free for life and data transmission at dirt cheap rates.  Jio is also gearing up for newer data-heavy services that can connect homes, businesses, and cars to the internet.  Ambani said with super-abundant youthful talent, India is poised to become the third largest economy in the world by 2028 -- within just a single decade.  &amp;quot;The idea of Jio was first seeded by my daughter, Isha, in 2011. She was a student at Yale (in the US) and was home for holidays. She wanted to submit some coursework &ndash; and she said, 'Dad, the internet in our house sucks',&amp;quot; he recalled.  Ambani said Isha's twin brother, Akash, at that time stated that in the old world, telecom was voice and people made money on calls but in the new world everything is digital.  &amp;quot;Isha and Akash belong to India's young generation that is far more creative, far more ambitious and far more impatient to become the best in the world. These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age and India cannot be left behind,&amp;quot; he said.  India at the time was suffering from poor connectivity and a severe scarcity of the most critical digital resource &ndash; data. Data was not only scarce, but it was priced artificially high to make it unaffordable to a majority of Indians, he said.  Jio transformed all of this by making data abundant and affordable and available in every part of the country.  &amp;quot;We launched Jio in September 2016. And today Jio has already become the biggest game changer in India,&amp;quot; he said.  Ambani said while the United States pioneered 1G mobile network, Europe ushered in 2G, and China leapfrogged with 3G, Jio has created the largest greenfield 4G LTE-only data network in the world.  &amp;quot;This will make India a leader in 4G in 2019,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It took the combined Indian telecom industry 25 years to build a pan-India 2G network. Jio took just three years to build a 4G LTE network, which is much larger and far more advanced. And it is also 5G-ready today.&amp;quot;  Jio has made voice-calling free for life and has also made high-quality data available at the lowest price in the world - at almost one-tenth the prices in the US, he said, and the firm acquired more than 100 million customers in just 170 days of launch.  This was more than one-and-a-half times the population of the United Kingdom.  For the 500 million Indians still using a feature phone and not a smartphone, Jio brought out the &amp;quot;world's most affordable 4G LTE smartphone&amp;quot; that is available for free for use with a deposit of Rs 1,500, he said. &amp;quot;The result has been stunning: 3 lakh to 5 lakh Indians are daily migrating to Jio Phone. And for the same Rs 200-300, they benefit through access to the high-speed internet with their existing voice needs are completely free.&amp;quot;  As the internet becomes accessible to all Indians, the country will be among the first to graduate to the Internet of Everything, he said.  &amp;quot;Within the next few years, Jio will empower the equivalent of two-thirds of Europe's population to enjoy world-class digital services in India,&amp;quot; he said, adding because of Jio, India has jumped from the rank of 155 to number one in the world in mobile broadband data consumption in less than two years.  &amp;quot;Jio has already grown to be the biggest start-up in India's history,&amp;quot; he said.  The previous honorees for the 'Drivers of Change' award include DeepMind Technologies (2016), FANUC (2015), HBO (2014), Alibaba (2013), MONDRAGON Corporation (2012), Amazon (2011), Apple (2010), Fiat (2009) and Ryanair (2008). RIL won it for its &amp;quot;exceptional commitment to innovation-led, exponential growth within the areas of hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and 4G digital services.&amp;quot;  Stating that his late father Dhirubhai Ambani was the original 'Driver of Change' in India's business history, he said the legendary industrialist founded Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 1966 with a meager capital of Rs 1,000 (about USD 130 at that time).  RIL, which today is an over USD 50 billion group, has doubled shareholder money every two-and-half years since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1977, he said. &amp;quot;During the same period, Reliance has contributed more to India's national wealth than any other business group.&amp;quot;  Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd."

So keeping stop loss there on upsides around Rs 1,300-1,310, one can go short in this stock. It is possible that the stock can dip towards Rs 1,200 in the coming days.

The target for establishing BS-VI emissions as the norm across the country were revised&nbsp;for 1 April 2020 from an earlier target of 2022.  Another prominent order by the Supreme Court was banning the sale and registration of vehicles that are not Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) compliant, passed on 31 March 2017.

The index in the process maintained its tendency of taking a breather after rallying for five to seven weeks as seen since CY&rsquo;17. The subsequent corrective decline has typically lasted for two-three weeks.  In the present scenario, with almost two weeks of fall already in place, we expect supportive efforts to emerge near the key value area of 10300-10100 region.  Therefore, investors should utilise ongoing correction as an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks in a staggered manner. The sharp recovery during current week&rsquo;s panic low of 10,300 indicates presence of buying support at lower levels.  Going forward, we expect Nifty to hold the key support zone of 10100-10300 and lead a pullback towards 10,750-10,800 levels in February 2018 as it is the Confluence of 50% and 61.8% retracement of recent decline (11171-10276) is placed at 10725-10830 and the breakdown level and Budget low is placed at 10880 levels.  The index is likely to consolidate and form a base formation in this broad range, which is likely to act as a foundation for next leg of rally in line with long-term bullish price structure  We expect the Nifty to hold its key support zone of 10100-10300 in the current decline. The key support is marked by the confluence of:  * 80% retracement of December 2017 &ndash; January 2018 rally (10075-11171) at 10295 which was held in current week&rsquo;s panic decline  * The strong base formation in November 2017 and a panic low of Gujarat election result day is placed in the 10033-10075 region  * Long-term 200-day rising moving average is placed at 10033 levels  Here is a list of two stocks which could give up to 20% return in the next 6 months:  Zee Entertainment: BUY CMP &ndash; 581| Target Rs698| Stop Loss Rs540| Return 20%| Time Frame 6 months  The share price of Zee Entertainment managed to topple its CY2000 peak in late 2016. Since then, it has been in a consolidation mode thereby discounting the disruptions created by key reforms like demonetisation and implementation of GST.  Recently, the stock has moved above its 2016 high and is seen consolidating above the breakout area in the last one-month signalling positive bias and resumption of a fresh uptrend.  The share price corrected from its October 2016 peak of Rs589 to anchor around Rs430 in December 2016. The subsequent 12-month period witnessed a basing pattern wherein the stock discounted a host of headwinds while maintaining a higher bottom formation.  The entire price action during this period has taken the shape of a contracting symmetrical triangle, which is a continuation pattern.  The consolidation, which is viewed as a secondary corrective phase within the primary uptrend, has rested upon long-term 52-week EMA. In early December 2017, the share price resolved higher out of a triangle pattern signalling end of corrective bias and resumption of the uptrend.  The aforementioned technical observations make us believe the consolidation phase that lasted over 12 months has come to maturity, in turn, giving a fresh entry opportunity.  We expect the stock to move higher towards the projected target of Rs710 in the medium term being the measuring implication of the triangular pattern breakout.  Reliance Industries: BUY at CMP Rs894| Target Rs1070| Stop Loss Rs810| Return 20% Time Frame 6 months  The share price of Reliance industries has been consolidating between the range of 970 and 870 in the last four months thus forming a base for the next up move.  The stock is currently placed near the lower band of the recent consolidation thus providing fresh entry opportunity to ride the next up move in the stock  The overall positive structural trend still remains intact as the five weeks of a rally during September to October 2017 from Rs785 to Rs960, went through nine weeks&rsquo; time wise correction, got retraced by 50% of the entire leg of up move.  The limited price wise correction corresponding to elongated time correction shows inherit strength and foretell positive momentum, going ahead.  Among the oscillators, the daily stochastic has generated a bullish crossover above its nine period&rsquo;s average thus supports the positive bias in the stock in the short term.  The above-mentioned technical evidence suggests the four months&rsquo; consolidation is likely to conclude, in turn, giving a fresh entry opportunity.  We expect the stock to move higher towards the projected target of Rs1070 in the medium term being the price equality of the last leg of up move from Rs779&ndash; 958 as projected from the recent trough of Rs895.

Several global brands including Mango, Forever 21 and Sephora have shift hands from DLF Brands in the Indian retail market. The local franchisee rights of Mango was acquired by online fashion retailer Myntra.com last year, while Forever 21's India business was acquired by the Aditya Birla Group in 2016.  DLF Brands had bought the franchise rights of Mothercare for 15 years in 2009.&nbsp;Currently, Mothercare operates through dozens of outlets and department store chain such as &nbsp;Shoppers Stop in India.  FirstCry.com was interested in acquiring Mothercare's distribution rights in India to mark its presence in the growing kids product market. The UK-based multinational specialises in products for expectant mothers and children up to 6 years old.  The market for baby and mother care products is growing on account of urbanisation, which has led to a rise in the number of nuclear families with both parents working.&nbsp;As a result, per capita expenditure on mother and child care has increased.  According to RNCOS, a business consulting service firm, India's baby care market is expected to post a CAGR of over 15 percent during 2015-2022.  In 2017, Mothercare's international sales during the crucial Christmas trading period declined 3 percent year-on-year, while like-for-like sales in the UK fell 7.2 percent and online sales dropped 6.9 percent.  The retailer reduced its total number of stores and discounted heavily in its end-of-season sale in its home country, according to reports.

Niko had in mid-2015 chosen to withdraw from the NEC-25 block and relinquish its interest to the remaining stakeholders.  RIL is the operator of the block with 60 per cent interest while BP of the UK has the remaining 30 per cent stake.  The 10 per cent stake has been split between RIL and BP in proportion to their equity stake.  Gas discoveries in North-East Coast block NEC-0SN-97/1 (NEC-25) hold recoverable reserves of 1.032 trillion cubic feet.  The Canadian company has been facing cash problems and had even put up for sale its interest in NEC-25 as well as 10 per cent stake in RIL's Krishna Godavari basin oil and gas producing block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6. It could not find a buyer though.  Last year, RIL had stated that the block oversight panel, called Management Committee (MC), has reviewed the declaration of commerciality (DoC) of gas find D-32 in the block.  MC is headed by upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), which had previously refused to give formal recognition to the D-32 and D-40 discoveries in the block due to absence of its mandated confirmatory tests.  The DGH had also previously not approved a USD 3.5 billion plan for developing gas discoveries in block NEC-25 in the absence of its prescribed Drill Stem Test (DST) to confirm two of the finds.  Thereafter, the partners decided to go for the DST test on one of the finds and relinquish or give up the other.  The presentation did not say if the partner have submitted a revised field development plan (FDP).  RIL in March 2013 had submitted a USD 3.5 billion Integrated Field Development Plan for producing 10 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the discoveries D- 32, D-40, D-9 and D-10 in NEC-25 by mid-2019.  The DGH, the nodal technical arm of the oil ministry, however refused to bring the development plan to the Management Committee for approval, disputing commerciality of D-32 and D-40 in the absence of Drill Stem Tests (DSTs).  RIL-BP-Niko decided to relinquish D-40 and conduct DST on D-32.  According to RIL, D-32 and D-40 hold an in-place reserve of up to 663 billion cubic feet capable of producing 170 million standard cubic feet per day.  RIL has so far made eight gas discoveries in the block.  MC reviewing the commerciality of D-32 paved the way for re-submission of the field development plan (FDP) and its consideration by the committee, sources said.

Call unwinding and fresh Put writing also signifies the positive momentum.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;So one can buy with a stop loss of Rs 957 and expecting it to head towards Rs 1,000 plus kind of levels.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Second trade is a buy on LIC Housing Finance. This stock has been a laggard, but it seems that it is bottoming out. We have seen strong momentum in Indiabulls Housing Finance and other NBFC companies, and LIC Housing Finance is surpassing its falling supply trend line. It has seen the positive divergence on the charts, so, some buying interest and the better risk reward ratio could attract the upside move in the counter.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;One can buy with a small stop loss of Rs 565 for the target towards Rs 595-600 zone.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Third trade is buy on Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;amp;amp;T).

",,"Companies, Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries, reliance jio, Result Analysis, RIL",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/result-analysis/petrochem-volumes-drove-compelling-reliance-q3jio-stoleshow_10381501.html,"Ruchi Agrawal and Nitin Agrawal Moneycontrol Research  Reliance Industries (RIL) reported a stellar quarter with strong performance across segments.&nbsp;While refining margins witnessed slight softness, in line with global trends, the earnings were substantially driven by a robust increase in petrochemical volumes. The retail segment threw a positive surprise with a more than doubling of revenues and profits.  However, what stole the show was the performance of the telecom venture, Jio, which in addition to a strong EBIDTA (earnings before interest depreciation and tax) posted its first quarterly after-tax-profit.    Segment wise performance      Refining: Slight softness but above the Street's expectation  Despite a slight sequential softness, gross refining margins (GRM) at USD 11.6 per billion barrels (bbl) were up 7.4 percent year on year (YoY) &ndash; USD 4.4/bbl above the benchmark Singapore refining margins. While revenues were up 23 percent YoY, EBIT (earnings before interest &amp;amp;amp; tax) slipped by 0.5 percent YoY due to the resumption of supplies after the hurricane season in the United States, which led to some softness in gasoline margins.  However, lower diesel cracks, positive naphtha cracks, weaker fuels and oil cracks and lower Arab light and heavy differential helped in sourcing and improved the overall complex refining margins.  The company now aims to expand its downstream presence, which stands at 1,291 outlets, with a simultaneous increase in overall throughput for petrol and diesel.    Petrochemicals &ndash; frontrunner in driving profitability  Petrochemicals segment stood as the frontrunner in driving the consolidated profitability with a record performance during the quarter, driven by an increase in volumes and a favorable product mix. Revenues increased by 47 percent while EBIT was up 73 percent YoY.  Production volume swelled by 7 percent at 8 million tonnes on the back of MEG and polyethylene production along with demand expansion in all major polymer products. The record EBIT was driven by higher margins in polypropylene and downstream polyester products  Upstream segment flattish  While the revenues saw a YoY increase of 34 percent, the profitability remained near flattish despite an increase the crude oil prices during the quarter. The uptick in revenues was largely due to commencement of CBM production and higher oil and gas price realizations. Domestic production declined 15 percent while US shale gas production fell by 14 percent YoY.  Jio  Jio reported revenue from operations of Rs 6,879 crores (up 11.9 percent qoq) and added 21.5 million subscribers over the last quarter bringing the subscriber base to 160.1 million at the end of December 2017. This gets translated into average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 154 per month (down 1.5 percent qoq), much better than its peers.    In terms of operating margin, Jio reported a significant expansion of 1472.5 bps in its EBITDA margin, which came at 38.2 percent. The expansion was primarily due to reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 34.8 percent of revenues from operations to 15.7 percent in this quarter. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had cut interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).  Additionally, the management attributes this performance to use of efficient 4G technology and significant addition of the paying customers for the quarter.  Organized retail  With the base of the demonetization quarter last year, the retail business delivered an impressive performance across all retail lines. The revenues and EBIT at Rs 18,798 crore and Rs 487 crore more than doubled YoY during the quarter. The company opened 72 new stores and aims to further expand retail presence in coming quarters.  Refinery off-cracker plant fully commissioned  The company has recently completed the full commissioning of the refinery cracker plant at Jamnagar which will use the refinery residue as a feedstock for the petrochemical business thereby ensuring cost advantage with vertical integration. This would help in further improving margins for the petrochemical business.  What next?  Post the end of an aggressive capex cycle. With a net capex at Rs 17,300 crore during the quarter RIL now stands at a sweet spot where most of its projects have started delivering and the company is likely to see a big cash flow boost in upcoming quarters with an uptick in the returns.  With the commissioning of the refinery of cracker plant we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business, which is already posting aggressive growth.  We believe that Jio would continue to maintain growth momentum on the back of a smart business strategy, latest 4G technology and huge unmet potential available in India. All this is likely to lead to further value unlocking from the telecom venture.

The stock, which is trading near record highs, closed 1.2 percent higher at Rs 931 on the NSE.  Tracking the results, most analysts expect the stock to open higher when trading resumes on Monday and possible rally to a fresh record high in the coming week.  The stock is just 3 percent short of its record high of Rs 959.50. RIL has already rallied nearly 80 percent in the last one year.  Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL in an interview to CNBC-TV18 said that GRMs at USD 11.6/bbl is largely in line. Overall, the numbers are in-line and ahead of estimates what we calculated.  Commenting on the stock, Bhasin said that if something can take you to 11,000 on the Nifty, I think it will be RIL. The IUC cut has been very poorly received by Bharti Airtel and Idea but will be a big blessing for Jio. Going forward, RIL will not be a laggard and if Nifty hits 11,000, RIL will be at Rs 1000, which could happen in next 3 days or a week, but is definitely on cards.  SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com in an interview to CNBC-Tv18 said that no analyst would have thought that Jio would report PAT in FY18 which we have seen in case of Q3. Having posted an EBITDA of Rs 2,628 crore with a Rs504 crore is a blast for Reliance Jio and will cheer markets going forward.  Commenting on the stock movement, Tulsian said that I will not be surprised to see the share moving into four digits ahead of the Budget or maybe in the coming week.  We have collated top 10 takeaways from RIL Q3 results:  Net Profit  RIL reported a consolidated net profit of Rs9423 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, up 16.2 percent QoQ compared to Rs8109 crore reported in the previous quarter and Rs7533 reported in the year-ago period. On a standalone basis, RIL reported a net profit of Rs8454 crore.  Net Revenues  RIL achieved revenue of Rs109,905 crore (USD 17.2 billion), an increase of 30.5 percent as compared to Rs84,189 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  The increase in revenue is primarily on account of volume increase with the start-up of petrochemicals projects and increase in prices in refining and petrochemical businesses.  The increase in consolidated revenues reflects robust growth of 116% in Retail business and continued enhancement in Jio&rsquo;s wireless operations.  Operating Profit  Operating profit before other income and depreciation increased by 52.0 percent to Rs17,588 crore (USD 2.8 billion) from Rs11,574 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Strong operating performance was driven by growth in petrochemicals, retail and digital services businesses along with firm refining margins.  Cash on Books  Cash and cash equivalents as on 31st December 2017 were at Rs78,617 crore (USD 12.3 billion) compared to Rs77,226 crore as on 31st March 2017. These were in bank deposits, mutual funds, CDs, Government Bonds and other marketable securities.  Capital Expenditure  The capital expenditure for the quarter ended 31st December 2017 was Rs17,336 crore (USD 2.7 billion) including exchange rate difference capitalization.  Capital expenditure was principally on account of Digital Services business, the balance of expenditure for projects in the petrochemicals and refining business at Jamnagar and in Organized Retail business.  Refining  Revenue from the Refining and Marketing segment for the quarter ended December 2017 increased by 23 percent on a YoY basis to Rs75,865 crore (USD 11.9 billion) aided by 24 percent higher Brent oil prices.  The segment EBIT marginally decreased by 0.5 percent on a YoY basis to Rs6,165 crore (USD 1.0 billion).  GRMs  Gross Refining Margins (GRM) for 3Q FY18 stood at USD 11.6/bbl as against USD 10.8/bbl in 3Q FY17. RIL&rsquo;s GRM outperformed Singapore complex refining margins by USD 4.4/bbl.  Petrochemicals Business  The revenue from the Petrochemicals segment for the quarter ended December 2017 increased by 47.6 percent on a YoY basis to Rs33,726 crore (USD 5.3 billion) due to higher volumes and prices.  Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at a record level of Rs5,753 crore (USD 901 million) supported by strong volume growth, higher margins for Polypropylene and downstream polyester products. The volume growth was led by the world&rsquo;s largest ROGC coming on-stream along with downstream LDPE, LLDPE and MEG plants.  Reliance Jio  Reliance Jio posted a Q3 profit at Rs 504 crore and EBITDA grew by 82 percent to Rs 2,628 crore QoQ. Jio continues its rapid ramp-up of subscriber base and as of 31st December 2017, there were 160.1 million subscribers on the network.  This makes it India&rsquo;s largest wireless data subscriber base, with the gap widening from the other operators. With gross additions of 27.8 million during the quarter, Jio continues to have a dominant share of all the new LTE smartphones sold in the country.  Reliance Retail  Revenues from the retail segment for the 3Q FY18 grew by 116.4 percent on a YoY basis to Rs18,798 crore compared to Rs8,688 crore reported in the year-ago period.  PBDIT for 3Q FY18 grew by 82.0 percent on a YoY basis to Rs606 crore from Rs333 crore reported in the year-ago period.

Reliance Jio, which has subscriber base of 16.01 crore, clocked its first-ever profit at Rs 504 crore for the December quarter against loss of Rs 271 crore in previous quarter.  &amp;quot;The interconnection usage charges (IUC) cut has been very poorly received by Bharti Airtel and Idea but will be a big blessing for Jio,&amp;quot; Bhasin said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  At operational level, Jio's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) grew by 82 percent sequentially to Rs 2,628 crore in Q3 and margin expanded by 1,470 basis points to 38.2 percent compared to previous quarter.  &amp;quot;Jio&rsquo;s strong financial result reflects the fundamental strength of the business, significant efficiencies and right strategic initiatives.

As of December 31, 2017, there were 16.01 crore subscribers on its network with gross subscriber addition of 2.78 crore and net subscriber addition of 2.15 crore during the quarter.

Kotak models RIL&rsquo;s consolidated net income at Rs 8,710 crore (EPS of 14.7) in 3QFY18, factoring in modest profit of Rs 48 crore from Jio as compared to loss of Rs 270 crore in 2QFY18 led by reduction in IUC costs, which will be offset by likely &lsquo;accounting&rsquo; of higher operating costs.  Sharekhan:  Sharekhan expects GRM of Reliance Industries (RIL) to decline on a sequential basis to USD 11.6/bbl in Q3FY2018 compared to USD 12/bbl reported in Q2FY2018.  The same would get offset by strong performance of the petrochemicals segment, which we expect to benefit from higher volumes (on account of ramp up of the recently commissioned petchem expansion projects) and feedstock benefit from U.S. ethane imports.  Overall, Sharekhan expects Q3FY2018 earnings of RIL to increase by 5.5 percent on a YoY basis (+2.4 percent q-o-q) to Rs 8,465 crore.

",,"Business, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance-declares-30-higher-refinery-capacity-at-export-plant-says-ppac-report_10363221.html,"India's Reliance Industries has declared a 30 percent increase in the installed capacity of its export-focused oil refinery, a government report showed, increasing the size of the world's largest refinery complex.  India's Petroleum Planning &amp;amp;amp; Analysis Cell (PPAC) in its October report showed 35.2 million tonnes a year as the installed capacity of Reliance's refinery in the special economic zone (SEZ) at Jamnagar, in northwest India. That is up from 27 million tonnes, or 540,000 barrels per day (bpd), as of April 1 that PPAC reported in an August 2017 report.  The new capacity is the equivalent of 704,000 bpd of crude processing.  Reliance built its first refinery at Jamnagar with an installed capacity of 660,000 bpd in 1999. This refinery sells most of its fuels in the local market. The SEZ plant was added in 2008 and turned the entire Jamnagar complex into the world's largest oil processing site.  Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed that Reliance has declared the increased SEZ capacity, which they said the company attributed to debottlenecking, or a by streamlining the processes at the plant.  &amp;quot;They have declared enhanced capacity,&amp;quot; said one of the sources by telephone, without providing details on how the company raised the capacity.  Reliance has been consistently operating its export-oriented refinery at a rate higher than the nameplate capacity  Reliance had no immediate comment on the increase when contacted by Reuters.  Although most of the products from the SEZ plant are meant for overseas market, some like cooking gas are sold in local markets.  Reliance's refineries are among the most complex in the world and have facilities that can maximize the production of diesel and gasoline from so-called heavy, or higher density, crude oil that typically sells for less than other crude grades.  Reliance, in a presentation to India's Center for High Technology (CHT), said it wanted to raise the capacity of its Jamnagar complex to 100 million tonnes a year by 2030, sources last year told Reuters.  CHT is a unit of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that evaluates projects and assesses their technological requirements.

In a report, CLSA said stabilisation of just-commissioned refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) and petcoke gasification projects would boost EBITDA.  The downstream expansions called J3 are likely to fully stabilise in early 2018 and should allow almost a full year of benefit to flow in FY2019.  RIL, which completed its capital expenditure cycle, yesterday announced commissioning of the world's largest refinery off-gas cracker complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. ROGC will use refinery process residue to produce feedstock used to make petrochemicals.  It is in the advanced stage of commissioning a petcoke gasification plant, which will convert coal and coke, the lowest-cost fossil fuels, into gas.  CLSA said the monetisation of the two plants will boost the operating income of the company but all the benefits will come only in the next financial year.  &amp;quot;Although it has indicated potential annual benefit of USD 2-2.5 billion, we model a smaller amount of USD 1.8 billion from these two projects. Stabilisation of these projects would give a big boost to oil and gas earnings over 12-15 months,&amp;quot; it said.  RIL's telecom venture, Jio, has achieved critical mass with a subscriber base of around 160 million. It has also cornered nearly 80 percent of the 4G smartphone base.  The 4G smartphone base will expand as users replace their existing smartphones. &amp;quot;We expect Jio to get to 100 million 4G feature phones by March 2019,&amp;quot; CLSA said.  It expects the company, which stormed the telecom world with its offer of free voice calls and cheap data, to monetise Jio's customers by gradually increasing average revenue per user, ramping up 4G feature phones, launch of home broadband and start enterprise solutions."

The company has now commissioned one of its most profitable core projects, a USD4.5bn off-gas cracker (ROGC), which is estimated to generate EBITDA or USD1.2bn (8% of FY19E EBITDA) and healthy project RoCE of 21%. The project is one of the most competitive globally with feedstock advantage and 33% lower capital costs. Similarly, its other oil-leveraged mega project, ethane imports from US, is already generating high returns and petcoke gasification (USD5bn) project should commence operations shortly. Maintain &lsquo;BUY&rsquo; with revised TP of INR1,151 (INR1,104 earlier), amongst the highest on the Street, as we rollover to FY20E.  Outlook With commissioning of mega core projects, we expect RIL&rsquo;s FCF to turnaround, RoE to increase and profit to double in 4 years.
