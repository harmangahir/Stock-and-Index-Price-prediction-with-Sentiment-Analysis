Kotak Mahindra Bank has also been the top all-round wealth creator, the brokerage firm said.  The Annual Wealth Creation Study further revealed that Tasty Bite Eatables has been the fastest wealth creator In the last 5 years while Reliance Industries has been the biggest and Pidilite has been the most consistent in the same period.  Besides, Ajanta Pharma, Alembic Pharma, Astral Poly Tech, AU Small Finance and Bajaj Finance are among the 'potential 25 wealth creators for the next 25 years', said the brokerage firm.    The brokerage firm on December 22 announced the Motilal Oswal 25th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2020.  For the last 25 years, the firm has been releasing a wealth creation study every year. Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman of Motilal Oswal Group, commissions&nbsp;the study every year.  In this year's study, the brokerage firm attempted to shortlist 25 stocks likely to deliver handsome returns over the next 25 years.  As per the brokerage firm, it made a list of 150 mid-cap companies i.e. companies that are ranked 101 to 250 by current market cap.  It preferred consumer-facing, secular business models and eliminated cyclical businesses like auto ancillaries, capital goods, chemicals, oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and realty which reduced the list of companies from 150 to 114.  To ensure the chosen firms are very profitable, the brokerage firm said it&nbsp;picked companies with last 5-year average RoE greater than 15 percent. This reduced the list from 114 to 63.  Next, it judged the business potential and management potential of the companies, and selected only those which qualified on both counts. This reduced the list from 63 to 28.  After that, the brokerage firm flagged off market leaders from the 28 companies to arrive at a list of 13 companies. Apart from these 13 companies, the brokerage chose 5 such companies from the list of 28 that are beneficiaries of value migration. In situations of value migration, all companies benefit irrespective of market leadership.  Now, the total shortlisted stocks were 18.  The brokerage firm said it chose only large-caps for financials and picked 6 leader names for the portfolio, now taking the total to 24.  At last, it opted for a pure digital play, even if it didn&rsquo;t meet some of the above filters, taking the total to 25.  &amp;quot;We believe in the very long run, valuations matter less. So we ignored the same in the shortlisting process,&amp;quot; said Motilal Oswal.

The conversation on Day 1 of the two-day Facebook-hosted event revolved around opportunities in India, the way digital can accelerate economic progress, and how small businesses will be a key part of the global recovery going forward.  Read the full transcript of the conversation between Mukesh Ambani and Mark Zuckerberg below:&nbsp;  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I am sorry that we can't do this together in person, but we're excited to host the first-ever Facebook Fuel event in India. India is a very special and important country for us. Millions of people here use our products every day to stay in touch with friends and family. Whether it's a WhatsApp message, or a Facebook post, or photos on Instagram. And millions of small businesses across the country use WhatsApp business and Messenger to reach customers, manage orders, and grow their businesses. And in fact, we actually test some of our new features here first, before rolling them out globally. And speaking of tests, we just announced that we are hosting India&rsquo;s tour of Australia on demand on Facebook Watch. I am not exactly a sports guy myself, but I understand that that's quite a big deal here. And what I do know is that India is home to a lot of incredibly talented people. Now we see that in the folks that we recruit in our offices, both in India and at our headquarters, back in California. But this is more than just about Facebook because what happens in India here is important for the whole world as well. Prime Minister Modi's Digital India Vision, has opened up opportunities for the industry to partner with the government to accelerate growth and development through technology. And India is building local capabilities and tech capacity, to power innovative new business models and provide Indian citizens access to digital and financial inclusion. So, decisions that are made here, shape the global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people. And a lot of Indian organizations are leading the way, and using technology to build safer communities and more inclusive financial systems. Whether it's in social commerce, or education or financial services, there is a lot of innovation that happens here, and we are proud to partner with some of the teams that are working on these important challenges. There's a very entrepreneurial culture here, that's quite remarkable. It's a great example of how access to better tools can unlock more opportunity for people, and we see that not just in the tech start-up scene, but millions and millions of small businesses that recognize the value that all these tools can provide. So, at Facebook, we like to say that we are in the business of serving small businesses. And nowhere is this more true than in India. This is especially important because small businesses here will be a key part of the global recovery going forward. And we are focused on making sure we build the best tools for them. So, this is part of a much broader conversation about how we can all make sure that tech delivers for everyone. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to partner with Jio, which has played such a key role in giving hundreds of millions of Indians access to the benefits of the internet, everything that it can provide, and fostering this entrepreneurial culture. And with that, I am really glad to welcome Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, to talk about where things stand in terms of the country's digital transformation, and what we should expect in the years ahead. Mukesh, thank you very much for being here and let's get started.  Mukesh Ambani: Mark, first of all, congratulations to you and your team for organizing this Facebook Fuel for India event. I am sure this event will provide a lot of fuel of ideas to fire India&rsquo;s growth engine as you just described. The most powerful idea that can propel India&rsquo;s growth is that young people can create great enterprises and new businesses. And all the young Indian people see an inspiring young icon in Mark Zuckerberg. They are motivated when they see how in just 14 years, Facebook has become the face of a digitally connected India. So, let me begin by conveying my best wishes to the success of your dreams for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, I appreciate that. You know, so maybe today we should start with a topic that I know is top of mind for a lot of us, that is COVID-19 and the impact that it has had on all of our lives and communities. So, I am curious from your perspective, how is India doing right now? And when do you expect things are going to return to normal? And I know that Reliance has taken a number of big steps to help the community and help the country, and it's been a big year for you. So I am curious to hear, how did your company adapt to help move forward in the midst of this pandemic?  Mukesh Ambani: The sheer magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic, like everybody else in the world, did startle all of us in India. But then I think it is not in India&rsquo;s DNA to be deterred by a crisis. I firmly believe that a crisis is too precious to be wasted. Every crisis presents an opportunity for new growth, and India has faced the COVID crisis with enormous resilience and resolve. Prime Minister Modi has led India from the front, and while we are not as rich a country as some of our western counterparts, being fiscally prudent, he has taken steps to take care of our vulnerable. We have given free food for right up to December of this year, to over 800 million Indians. 200 million citizens in India are getting direct cash transfer of Rs. 1500 in their bank account - that is the digitally connected India. And now we are ready and pretty much at par with the world, to roll out one of the largest vaccine programs in the first half of 2021, under Prime Minister's leadership. We at Reliance and Reliance Foundation, have also taken steps. As you know, Reliance has over 350,000 employees across the length and breadth of India and we have taken steps to protect over 2 million in our family and the community around them. In Mumbai, we have built a hospital just dedicated to COVID-19. We have Life Sciences as part of our business, so we have tested up early on - we have really ramped up testing, and we believe that testing helped in tracing and isolation, and at least reduced fatalities in our communities to a very low level. We have produced PPEs. We are in the textile business in Reliance, and India did not have&hellip;we used to import all our protective gear from the external world. In a matter of months, we at Reliance, produced a hundred thousand PPE's, and we are now exporters from India and this happened during the COVID time. And most importantly in the early days, when we were little stuck, we at the Reliance Foundation, distributed 55 million, one of the largest meal distribution programs for the vulnerable, in all the states and villages. So, we have played our part. And as far as Jio is concerned, we had our own dedicated team. And I could tell you that, we had never imagined that we would all work from home and the network traffic grew multiple percentage and none of us stepped out. But we could maintain 99% availability, so that Indians could work from home, shop from home, study from home, and remain connected to the rest of the world. You know, Mark, sometimes I wonder that if the pandemic had struck India just four or five years earlier, we would not have been in as good a shape as what we are today, with all the connectivity we have. The credit for that must go to our Prime Minister's Digital India vision, where he motivated the entire industry to roll out broadband in the first five years of his first term. And during the pandemic, India has attracted the largest foreign direct investment in its history. Mark, we have our own example of how Jio and Facebook concluded our partnership right in the middle of lockdown. And let me tell you with utmost sincerity, that we at Reliance and Jio, immensely value our partnership with Facebook. Thank you for your faith in Jio. Thank you, Mark, for your faith in India. I have no hesitation in going on record, that it is your investment that set the ball rolling. Not only for Jio but for the Indian FDI which has been the largest-ever in its history. And our partnership between Jio and Facebook will actually demonstrate that it is great for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses. And I believe Mark, that our actions will speak louder than our words in the coming months and years.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you. So, you know, one of the big opportunities that I see with this Facebook and Jio partnership is the role that we can play together in supporting the millions of small businesses in India, especially now with the impact that COVID is having, in accelerating the move of businesses from physical storefronts to digital ones in this digital future. So, I am curious what role do you see technology playing in this post-COVID world, especially as it relates to all of these small businesses. I know you share a passion with me that it is just critical that we serve them.  Mukesh Ambani: Absolutely, Mark. And let me point out a very unique feature about our partnership. Perhaps not many people have understood this. Because, before this partnership I believe that each one of us was mainly a communication platform. Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses. And I firmly believe that technology, all the digitisation steps that India has taken will democratise wealth and value creation for individuals and small businesses. And let me explain this very simply. WhatsApp has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio Mart, which is our retail service, has the aspiration of serving tens of millions of small shopkeepers in India, who are the bedrock of employment. So what does this mean? This means Jio brings digital connectivity, WhatsApp now with WhatsApp Pay brings digital interactivity, and the ability to move to close transactions and create value and Jio Mart brings the unmatched online and offline retail opportunity, that gives our small shops which exist in villages and small towns in India, a chance to digitize and be at par with anybody else in the world. To my mind, more wealth creation means more employment and more business. And together with our platforms and the tools that we will provide to small businesses and to individual consumers, I believe will drive India to a 5 trillion economy and will make a much more equal India, with more equal wealth growth at the bottom of the pyramid. You know, Mark, I firmly believe that in the next two decades, India will grow to be among the top three economies in the world. But more importantly, it will become a premier digital society. It will be a modern society with young people driving it, with young businesses driving it. And our per capita income will go from eighteen hundred - two thousand dollars per capita, to five thousand dollars per capita. Our mid-income or the middle class in India which is about 50% of its total number of households, will grow to three to four percent per year. And I think that Facebook, Jio, and a lot of other companies and entrepreneurs in the world, have a golden opportunity to be in India, to be part of this economic and social transformation, that we are witnessing and that will accelerate in the coming decades.  Mark Zuckerberg: I completely agree, and your company has already done so much to help fuel this. Reliance brought about the 4G revolution in India, and I know that 5G now is another big focus for you. But what your company has done here I think, has been truly remarkable in helping to bring hundreds of millions of people onto the internet and bringing opportunity. And I&rsquo;m curious, as you look ahead to the future in India, what other technologies or developments are you excited about now? And where do you see the country in the next five to ten years?  Mukesh Ambani: Well, as I mentioned to you Mark, I really see India accelerating as a premier digital society. I see us integrating both 5G&hellip;and just yesterday, our Prime Minister has said that, he wants every village and every gram panchayat&hellip;India has 680,000 villages, and we have a population of 1.3 billion people, and he wants everybody to be empowered on the information highway with high speed fix broadband, and which is happening. We also think that compute and very low latency compute is real. I think that there is a great opportunity for really bringing education and health care. With the second-generation reforms that were done in the last six months, we have unique opportunities and as Jio we are connecting all the 1.9 million schools in India and the 58 000 colleges. At any point in time, we will have in the coming decades, about 200 million children or young adults, between the age of 3 and 18 in our education system. I think that in a span of 10 years, we can set for ourselves an objective really to reskill India and the talent that you talked about, can improve 10x. Today, you're just seeing the creamy layer, but that's what technology can do to really make a better India and a better world. The same thing we can do in health and all the emerging technology and integrations, where we can make sure that we deliver services, and we deliver good proactive health. We've learned that and I think we're going to use technology. We are working very closely with all the authorities to make sure that we provide the technology tools and backbone for even vaccination in the coming quarters using technology. So, I think health, education&hellip;.we've already&hellip; and I think that what India has done is in a sense, we have democratized value creation with the drive of our Prime Minister. And you can see it in payments, you will see it in terms of making sure that technology is easily available and we made it affordable, so that millions of millions of people, even at this lower per capita basis can use this in a large market. And with that finally, I really see the enterprise and the enthusiasm of young Indians, their aspirations, and their confidence that is really driving India. And that is why I think that the next two decades are going to be historic in terms of the social and economic transformation.  Mark Zuckerberg: That makes sense. You, of course, already talked about commerce and driving small businesses and entrepreneurship. It always blows me away that India has more than 60 million small businesses, and millions of people around the country rely on them for jobs and that's a big part of what I hope that our partnership can serve here. We support more than 50 million WhatsApp business app users globally every month already. And more than 15 million of these are in India. So you know with communities around the world now in lockdown there are a lot of these entrepreneurs who need digital tools that they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses. And now this is just something that I think that our partnership can really help with. And of course, beyond the impact on small businesses.I just think that this year has reminded us of how essential technology can be as a tool for people, to just connect with each other. Whether it's using the networks that your companies have established, or the tools that we've built to be able to have that human connection, and find important information. And as you said, I can't imagine going through the pandemic 10 years ago, two decades, when the internet was still nascent. It should have been a completely different experience. And technology, of course, is allowing us to make sure we can get accurate information out to people that has implications in health, like you're talking about, in education and helping serve people better. And I think it shows a lot of the promise for what's ahead and I think we've certainly fared better now, than we would have if the pandemic had hit us before.  Mukesh Ambani: I couldn't agree more, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: You know, going back to Reliance, one of the great business stories in history, your father founded Reliance Industries and he has this incredible legacy here in India. And now I&rsquo;ve read that, he once held up a postcard in his office and said, if every Indian could speak with each other at the cost of this postcard, where will India be? And now your father clearly had a vision for where things were heading in the country, and because today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard, and that's what we've tried to do with messaging&hellip;and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI system, which I think is just great. It's a tremendous public good that the government has put out there. But I am curious, before we get into UPI and more on that, what's the most important thing that you learned from your father and his legacy, that has helped you build these amazing businesses and get to where they are today?  Mukesh Ambani: So Mark, thank you for those kind words on my father. Just so that when he motivated us in 2000, in terms of saying, can you make voice at the cost of a postcard? In 2020, we're very proud that Jio has pioneered free voice. So, all the 400 million people are a tribute to his vision. They are on our network and have a free voice. And as you said, my father was a son of a school teacher. He came to Mumbai with just a thousand rupees in 1960 and established Reliance with a belief that I will invest in businesses of the future, and I will invest in talent. And, for all the young people at Reliance and across India, I repeat my learnings in terms of building Reliance, three basic tenets really. One is, for entrepreneurs, it's important to have courage and self-belief. There can be no better person to demonstrate that in the last couple of decades than you, Mark. So you know, all of us believe that we have to believe in ourselves. And all of us know as entrepreneurs that we don't succeed at the first attempt, and self-belief comes to you when you fail. And self-belief increases your confidence when you succeed. So, courage and self-belief is something that I always tell entrepreneurs, remember that it's important. The second piece that he started and he's instilled into all of us is that, while you succeed, it's important to always have empathy and creativity in everything that you do. And by empathy, I mean, put yourself in the other's shoe, and make sure that how you make them feel is how you would want to feel. At Reliance, we do that at many levels now - we care for our employees, our investors, society, environment, and above all national interests of India. You know, within creativity&hellip;.and I always give this example in terms of saying that, when Reliance needed to grow, capital markets were not there. It was the 1980s, and my father came up by saying, I will actually share shares of Reliance, which was never done in the private sector. In the 80s, the first AGM of Reliance was in a football ground, and we had 60,000 shareholders. You and I both do annual general meetings. And his AGM in the 1980s for Reliance was in a football ground and he said, my purpose is really to win investor&rsquo;s confidence. Since then, creativity and empathy are critical as you go along. And the final thing that I have learned from my father, is really the importance of relationship, trust, and loyalty. The whole of Reliance right now, with hundreds of thousands of people, is one big family. We're not related by birth, but we are really woven together by passion, purpose, and conviction. We have faith in one another. We are loyal to one another, to this large Reliance family. For us, it's always one for all, and all for one. And I hope that a lot of people around the world can relate to this. That's what we believe at Reliance and for all of us at Reliance, he will still be the founder, if we follow his vision in terms of investing in businesses of the future. Mark, now that brings me to questions for you. Mark, what made you believe in India and the Jio story? As I said, you started this FDI avalanche in India, and the world recognized when Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, in the middle of lockdown said, I am going to bet on India and I&rsquo;m going to make even in this uncertain times, one of the largest foreign direct investments in India. What do you think of the digital network that you are clearly&hellip;.I call you the architect of the digital network of the world. While I have built some connectivity and broadband connectivity in India, you've done that for the world. Please share with us your experience as the digital architect of the world, how your global Facebook has helped people in this crisis, and your perspective of the crisis, and where you see the world today, and where it is going after you just explain to us what you&rsquo;ve done in India?  Mark Zuckerberg: Your words are incredibly generous. And we started this to help give people a tool to stay connected with their friends, and then expand to friends and family and communities, and a lot of this just ends up being a universal human phenomenon. No matter what country you're in, you know everyone cares about their friends and family, and their communities, and wants to stay connected. And what we've seen is that, India is actually home to the largest communities in the world, across Facebook and WhatsApp and getting there on Instagram, as well. So, we see the vitality and the entrepreneurship, and the creativity of businesses, and how much people want to connect, and you see a tremendous number of people coming online, a lot of that&hellip;thanks to your investments, and the work that you've done to enable hundreds of millions of people to come online here. And I just see a very promising future in India. We talked briefly about how there's a big trend of financial inclusion ahead, and how the ease of payments is going to be such a big deal for commerce, and giving people self-reliance and control of their own destiny, and a lot of that. We just launched WhatsApp payments in India last month - now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp, as easily as sending a message. That was possible because of the UPI system that has been built in India. Unified Payments Interface, makes it easy for anyone to instantly accept payments across different apps. I think we're working with 140 banks or it's supported by 140 banks. India is the first country in the world to do anything like this. So, we're grateful to be able to support this kind of innovation and to help to work, to create more prosperity, and help achieve a more Digital India. And frankly, I think that a lot of other places around the world are going to be better off when they follow some of this lead that India has set, in creating public goods like this. So there's really a tremendous amount to be inspired by, with what is going on in India now. And we're just grateful to be able to serve our community here, and help people stay connected with the people they care about but also, create economic opportunity as well.  Mukesh Ambani: Thanks Mark, as you said, we are looking forward to your involvement and innovation in India, creating benefit for hundreds of millions of people and then taking this innovation to the rest of the world. I hope that the rest of the world learns from Indian policy, and what Facebook is able to achieve in India. And we as Indians will be very proud, if Facebook says we did it first in India, and then took it to 100 countries. And I look forward to working with you on that. Mark, all of us would love to know your views on how the world is changing, and what you and Facebook are thinking about it, and what you see the future as. Just give us your perspective, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: I think that there are a number of very important trends, but maybe I'll just talk about two. So, one is that, I think technology is giving individuals&rsquo; power and opportunities that were previously only held by large organizations. So, we've spent a lot of time today talking about small businesses, but one of the things that I think is so powerful about the internet is it makes it so that individual entrepreneurs and small businesses can now have access to the same kind of tools for reaching new customers and doing sophisticated analytics and communication that previously only bigger companies would have been able to build up the capacity to do that. And individuals can now share their ideas online, and get access to information in ways that previously only wealthier people or larger organizations would have had the capacity to share their ideas, or get access to information at that kind of scale. And overall, I think that just makes people's lives better. It's incredibly empowering and it's incredibly democratizing. India being the world's largest democracy, I think it really makes sense to lead there, because just empowering individuals, which I know is something that you believe deeply in as well, is just going to be a huge part of what will hopefully create a lot of prosperity, as you mentioned in the decades ahead. The other thing that I&rsquo;m excited about is more of a technological vision for the future. There are a lot of interesting technologies, but one trend that I focus a lot on is that as people we're always looking to connect with other people and share our experiences in the richest way that we can. So, if you look back to the beginning of the internet, most of the internet was text. We would text each other, chat, share our experiences but then connections got better. And then we got to photos being the primary way that we shared. And you know the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, a lot of sharing is through photos and we're now on the next step with 4G and coming 5G networks - video is really becoming the primary way that people share. Anyone can largely capture something on their phones and can share it or stream it, and increasingly, people are able to consume that. And video is just a lot richer of a medium than photos even can be. When my daughters took her first steps, I wanted to capture a video of that and share it, not just a photo. But I don't think video is the end of the line. So, a lot of what I am focused on is helping to create virtual reality and augmented reality. So that way we can share not only a video of an experience, but you can use virtual reality to go into an experience and feel like you're right there. You can have holograms of digital objects that can kind of be as realistic as the physical objects that are there. Maybe you know, in five or ten years, when we're having this conversation, just a hologram version of me will be sitting on the couch next to you, instead of having to do this over a screen. And it'll feel a lot more realistic. So, I just think that's going to be incredibly powerful. And the power of virtual and augmented reality is they deliver the sense of a presence. You feel like you're right there with another person, which really will be the ultimate in human connection, and it will give people the opportunity to work and to connect, no matter where they want to be. So that's something that we're very focused on and invested in. And I&rsquo;m just very excited for the future. And on that note, let me just wrap up and just say again how grateful I am for everything that you and your companies do, and for the partnership. I do think that in so many ways, not just Jio and the technology platforms, but the other businesses that you've built, you've had such a positive impact on improving the quality of lives for hundreds of millions of Indians. A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people. So, I just have a deep admiration for that. And I am really looking forward to working together over the coming years and decades to make sure we can serve the people in India as well as possible. And hopefully, a lot of those advances will be expanded outside of India as well, to help people around the world. But I am incredibly grateful for your partnership on this. Thank you for joining me for this inaugural Facebook Fuel event today.  Mukesh Ambani: Thank you very much, Mark. And thank you for sharing your awesome vision of the future. You started this with saying that on Facebook, you would see the India - Australia cricket match, I look forward to a day when Facebook will take me with everything that you explained on virtual reality, where I will be sitting in Mumbai and be in a stadium in Australia. And I&rsquo;m sure that day, with your digital architecture and leadership, is not far away. Thank you so very much for having me.

Here's what Ambani said during the virtual address:  Honourable Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupaniji, my fellow members of the Board, faculty, teachers, staff, students, parents, and my dear friends,  A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. I wish all of you good health and safety. I hope that you are all taking necessary precautions to keep yourself and your dear ones safe and protected.  India has entered a crucial phase in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot afford to let our guards down at this juncture.  We are extremely privileged to have the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Sh Narendrabhai Modi, as the chief guest for today&rsquo;s event. His passionate and dynamic leadership has made the world sit up and take notice of the emergence of a New India.  His confidence and conviction have inspired and galvanised the entire nation.  I am sure that the bold reforms introduced under his leadership will pave the way for India&rsquo;s swift recovery and rapid economic progress in the years to come.  Friends, all of us know that PDPU itself is a product of Honourable Prime Minister Narendrabhai's &amp;quot;Atmanirbhar&amp;quot; vision.  It is a vision he cherished even when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat...to make India self-reliant in the areas of Energy, Energy Education, Research and Innovation.  PDPU is only fourteen years old. Yet, it already ranks among the Top-25 in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements.  In terms of diversity, we attract international students from across the world. We have 284 international students from 39 countries.  And from a total of 132 students in the first convocation in 2009, we have 2,608 students, including 46 PhDs, graduating today.  From National Rankings, I am sure PDPU will soon earn a place in global rankings.  My dear teachers, PDPU has world-class physical infrastructure. But what gives me far greater joy is that PDPU has world-class faculty as well. Your dedication and commitment to excellence has been exemplary.  In the best practice of India's Guru Parampara, you have always gone beyond the call of duty. You have been friends, guides and mentors to your students. Let's take a moment to appreciate the leadership, faculty and all the staff of PDPU.  Friends, today I have a special reason to applaud PDPU. The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on the academic lives and careers of students across the world.  Precious hours of academic engagement, debate and research have been lost in lockdowns. Yet, our very own PDPU did exceptionally well even in these challenging times.  The flame of teaching and learning at PDPU shone brightest even during the darkest days of the pandemic. Our faculty continued to present award-winning research papers in national and international conferences. Our students continued to enjoy co-curricular and extra-curricular activities held digitally.  These facts make me proud of our university. But my heart swelled with greater pride when I learnt that PDPU also contributed to the nation's fight against COVID-19. Our teachers and students designed several medical equipment, including an ICU ventilator.  I salute the leadership of PDPU for combining Jnana with Seva. This combination is the greatest badge of honour for any educational institution.  Dear members of the PDPU Community, our accomplishments so far have been a source of joy.  However, we have to prepare ourselves to scale still higher summits of success.  The future of energy is being shaped by unprecedented changes. And these changes are impacting the future of humanity &mdash; indeed, the very future of our planet.  The most important question we face is this:  Can we produce the growing amounts of energy we need to sustain our economies without harming the environment?...Without failing to fulfil our climate change obligations? We must be prepared to answer this question with a CONFIDENT &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;!  By the middle of this century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today. In the next two decades, India&rsquo;s own per-capita energy needs will be more than twice as much as today.  Therefore, India is required to simultaneously pursue two goals: To become an economic superpower. To become a green and clean energy superpower.  To achieve these twin goals, we need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies. We need breakthroughs in new energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen. We also need great innovations in energy storage, saving and utilisation.  As a person from the energy business, I can assure the students and faculty of PDPU that you are entering an exciting future.  What makes it even more exciting is the synergy between the Energy Revolution and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. If we master this synergy, we will surely be able to make India one of the most prosperous nations in the world. An India that guarantees prosperity and wellbeing for all 1.3 billion Indians.  Honourable Chief Minister Shri Rupani ji, Gujarat is a trailblazer state. It has always shown the pioneer spirit. Today the entire world acknowledges that NEW GUJARAT has paved the path for NEW INDIA. The visionary leadership of Shri Narendra Modi ji that Gujarat received is now available to the nation.  I must compliment you and your team for making Vibrant Gujarat even more vibrant under the guidance of Shri Modi ji and Shri Amit Shah ji.  Here is our solemn assurance to you today. PDPU will continue to make its unique contribution to enhancing the reputation of Gujarat and India in energy education and research.  My dear Young Graduates, I see in you, 2,608 future builders of a strong, proud and vibrant India. My heartiest congratulations to you on your success. May all your dreams come true as you embark on a new journey in your life.  However, always remember an important life lesson. Learning is a constant and never-ending process of exploration, discovery and adventure. A true student never stops the pursuit of knowledge.  Therefore, here is my message to you, and I am only repeating Mahatma Gandhi's wise words: &amp;quot;Learn for life, Learn through life, and Learn throughout life&amp;quot;.  I have another message for you. When you step out of this beautiful campus, you will no doubt carry wonderful memories with you.  But perhaps you will also carry some concern, some uncertainty, some anxiety about the future.  This is only natural. The COVID situation will likely accentuate your thoughts and feelings.  Therefore, I would like to tell you with great emphasis today...venture out with supreme hope and confidence. The future is very bright for India, for you, and for all Indians.  This, our ancient nation, has faced many adversities in the past. And has emerged stronger each time. This is because resilience is in the very DNA of Indian people, Indian culture.  In the post-COVID era, I clearly foresee explosive and exponential growth in the Indian economy. Within a couple of decades, India will be among the top three economies in the world.  Growth will create unprecedented opportunities and possibilities for young and talented people like you. Indeed, most of these opportunities will be created by young entrepreneurs themselves. I see many amongst you as the creators of successful startups.  The world is waiting for you. Step out and take the plunge. Fail, if necessary, but in pursuit of your dreams. With passion, purpose and persistent effort, your dreams will indeed come true.  We, at PDPU, take pride in now calling you our alumni &ndash; our ambassadors. Make all of us at PDPU proud. Make your parents proud. Make India proud.  Once again, my hearty congratulations to the Class of 2019 and 2020. Good luck and God bless.  Thank you.

The mega transaction cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to its ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  Reliance Retail-Future Group deal: RIL unit adds Future Group&rsquo;s retail business to shopping cart for Rs 24,713 crore.&nbsp;  The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into Future Enterprises Ltd (FEL).  The announcement comes as a setback to Amazon.com which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.  Amazon had moved the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October and won an interim stay on the deal. The SIAC passed the interim order asking Future Group to hold its plans of selling its retail business to RIL on October 25.&nbsp;  Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into FRL after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owned a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.  Along with this, Amazon even wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI seeking a stay on the deal.  Later, Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) on November 7 moved the Delhi High Court against Amazon.com for interfering in its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL) by misusing the arbitration order passed by SIAC.

Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.  &amp;quot;India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,&amp;quot; he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions. This, he said, was &amp;quot;very, very compelling&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Why is India important, because it is India,&amp;quot; he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50 percent coal to 40 percent, while gas and renewables will grow. Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.  As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports.  RIL holds 51 percent in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49 percent. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49 percent stake. This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought a 30 percent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India. RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.  &amp;quot;Our production with Reliance will account for 15 percent of India gas production,&amp;quot; he said. Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.  GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that. When Goods and Services Tax (GST), which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products &ndash; petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.  This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel. He said BP has a &amp;quot;deep, trusting relationship&amp;quot; with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.  On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.  Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30 percent of the world average, offering huge potential. &amp;quot;We want to be an important part of India,&amp;quot; he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country.

In an interview with PTI, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said the intention is to become energy company of the country and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products.  IOC, which controls over 40 percent of India&rsquo;s diesel-dominated petroleum product market, recently introduced differentiated LPG for industrial users that gives flame temperature that is 80 percent higher than conventional cooking gas, thereby cutting down cooking time and saving 5-8 percent on fuel.  Also, the company has introduced hydrogen-spiked CNG that will give BS-VI (equivalent to Euro-VI) emissions from BS-IV vehicles, he said.  &amp;quot;Eventually we intend to become energy company of India and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products,&rdquo; he said.  &amp;quot;The world is changing. We intend to set up EV charging points and battery swapping stations at our petrol pumps alongside offering auto-LPG and conventional fuels. So it will be a bouquet of offering.&rdquo;  &amp;quot;Eventually we intend to become energy company of India and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products,&rdquo; he said.  IOC has already set up EV-charging points at 76 petrol pumps and battery-swapping facilities at 11 outlets.  It is also evaluating different advanced battery technologies and intends to set up a metal-air battery-manufacturing facility for EVs as well as for stationary applications.  Vaidya said being the biggest retailer, IOC faces the threat of losing market share to any new entrant.  &amp;quot;We understand that and so we are now focusing on the way we do retail,&rdquo; he said.  All the 29,800 petrol pumps of the company have been fully automated and their look and feel enhanced to match private-sector competition.  &amp;quot;Now, we are damn sure of giving Q&amp;amp;amp;Q, that is quality and quantity,&rdquo; he said.  &amp;quot;With automation done, we can guarantee that.

Public sector firms dominate India&rsquo;s fuel market but new entrants such as Nayara Energy have been chipping at their market share.  Vaidya said IOC has strong research and development (R&amp;amp;amp;D) that is bringing to market differentiated fuels.  The company has got encouraging response for its recently launched differentiated LPG and will now go for expanding its reach, he said.  &amp;quot;We have launched a differentiated LPG with the brand name Indane 'Xtra Tej&rsquo; last month for non-domestic customers. It will yield approx 5-8 percent savings in fuel consumption over normal LPG,&rdquo; he said.  Also, the company has introduced CNG spiked with 18 percent hydrogen that eliminates the need for replacing the old BS-IV fleet of vehicles as it gives emissions compliant with superior BS-VI grade, he said adding H-CNG is being dispensed from one outlet in the national capital and would soon be extended to others.  IOC has also established itself as the second-largest player in natural gas in India with a licence to retail CNG and piped cooking gas in 40 Geographical Areas.  &amp;quot;We are also aggressively promoting the use of compressed biogas, 2-G ethanol, and biodiesel produced from used cooking oil, besides integrating our refinery processes with biofuels production,&rdquo; he said.

But the fuel business is prone to volatilities that squeeze margins.  &amp;quot;This would de-risk the fuel business.

According to Ambani, during the third industrial revolution, when information technology came to prominence, India joined the race but still remained behind, trying to catch up with the leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;quot;As we step into the fourth industrial revolution, India has the opportunity, not just to catch up with the leaders but to emerge as a global leader itself,&amp;quot; he added.  Read the full text of Mukesh Ambani's speech below:  Distinguished Leaders and Attendees,   Greetings from India.  Let me first wish all of you, and your dear ones, the best of health and safety.  I want to thank Nik, Steffen and TM Forum for inviting me to talk about the journey of Jio and our vision for India&rsquo;s digital future.  Friends,  India missed out on the first two industrial revolutions and the changes brought about by them.  During the third industrial revolution, where Information Technology came to prominence, India joined the race but still remained behind, trying to catch up with the leaders.  As we step into the fourth industrial revolution, India has the opportunity, not just to catch up with the leaders but to emerge as a global leader itself.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution is driven by the convergence of digital and physical technologies&hellip; such as Digital connectivity, Cloud and Edge computing, IoT and smart devices, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Blockchain, AR/VR and genomics.  And the three foundational requirements needed to participate in this revolution are ultra-high-speed connectivity, affordable smart devices and transformational digital applications and solutions.  Jio was conceived for India to enable this journey.  Let me first talk about connectivity&hellip;  Before Jio, India was stuck with 2G technology&hellip;  And Jio wanted to end India&rsquo;s data misery and unleash a digital revolution.  We built a world-class, all-IP, future-proof digital network that delivers the highest speeds and the best coverage across India.  While it took 25 years for the Indian telecom industry to build its 2G network, Jio built its 4G network only in three years.  And to ensure widespread adoption of data, we launched with the lowest data tariffs in the world&hellip; and made voice services completely free for Jio users.  Second, let me talk about devices&hellip;  Before Jio&hellip; over half a billion Indians were left out of the digital movement because they couldn&rsquo;t afford smartphones and had to make do with 2G feature phones.  Our young and talented Jio engineers rose to the challenge of designing the world&rsquo;s ultra-affordable breakthrough device called the JioPhone.  That provided a window to the world of limitless possibilities for over 100 million Indians in less than a year.  Third, let me now talk about digital applications and solutions.  Right from day one, Jio offered a bouquet of mobile applications and solutions that offered our customers rich content&hellip; spanning Live TV, Movies, Music, News, Magazines&hellip; in addition to other apps that addressed collaboration, financial services, payments and so on.  When we combined digital connectivity, digital devices and digital applications and solutions &hellip; the results were amazing.  Adding customers at a mind-boggling rate of seven customers every second, Jio garnered 100 million customs in just 170 days of its launch.  And India&rsquo;s monthly consumption went up from 0.2 billion GB to 1.2 billion GB&hellip; a growth of 600%... and data consumption has been multiplying ever since.  Today, India consumes over 6 exabytes of data every month&hellip; more than 30 times pre-Jio levels, just four years ago.  We have gone from 155th in the world to number ONE in mobile data consumption&hellip; in JUST FOUR years.  The Jio movement shattered the widely held belief that India is not ready to adopt advanced technologies.  Today, I can say with utmost confidence that India will play a leading role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  To further extend our global leadership in connectivity, Jio is now rolling out a high-speed, low-latency optic fiber network to more than 50 million homes and premises across 2000 towns and cities in India.  Simultaneously, we are preparing for rolling out 5G services across India.  And Jio Platforms, our digital solutions arm with its growing portfolio of over 20 start-up has built significant capabilities in areas like Cloud and Edge Computing, Big Data Analytics, AI &amp;amp;amp; Machine Learning, Blockchain, AR/ VR and IoT.  Using these technologies, Jio Platforms is in the process of creating compelling solutions for multiple industry verticals and ecosystems spanning Telecom, Media and Entertainment, New Commerce, Financial Services, Education, Healthcare and Agriculture.  We believe that these will have a transformative effect on the social, economic and full development of India.  This is just the beginning for India.  Each of these solutions, once perfected in India and proven at India-scale will be well positioned to address similar needs in other parts of the world.  Clearly, exciting times lie ahead for India and Indians.  Friends,  The Fourth Industrial Revolution has presented us a unique opportunity to create unprecedented value and prosperity for everyone in all spheres of life.  We must invest in building next-generation technology assets.  We must root out inefficiencies across the digital physical ecosystem.  We must break silos and forge winning partnerships.  Only then can we build and sustain a truly digital society.  Jio has been founded on these very values.  It has been conceived not as a business, but as a digital movement.  It is on a mission of making Digital Life a reality for 1.3 billion Indians,  It is on a mission of creating digital platforms upon which 1.3 billion dreams will thrive and flourish.  It is committed to playing a leading role in India's transformation into a DIGITAL SOCIETY and one of the leading digital economies in the world.  It will continue to dream big, and march towards its goals with audacity and fervour.  Because&hellip; for those who dare to dream, there is a whole new world to win.  Thank you very much ladies &amp;amp;amp; gentlemen and my warmest wishes for a productive virtual conference ahead.

At present, COVID-19 RT-PCR test, which is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, takes up to 24 hours to give a diagnosis.  The sources said computational biologists at Reliance Life Sciences, a subsidiary of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries Ltd, analysed more than 100 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in India and designed unique RT-PCR primers for developing quantitative-Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) kit for COVID-19 detection. RT-PCR kit is so far considered as Gold standard.  The kit, developed by scientists at Reliance Life Sciences, is named R-Green Kit (SARS COV2-real-time PCR) and has been technically validated by ICMR for satisfactory performance, the sources said. ICMR's validation process does not approve/disapprove the kit design as well as it does not certify user-friendliness.  The sources said the kit can detect the presence of E-gene, R-gene, RdRp gene of SARS COV2 virus with Actin as an internal control. As per ICMR results, the kit shows 98.7 percent sensitivity and 98.8 percent specificity.  This kit is a complete indigenous development by the R&amp;amp;amp;D scientists working at the firm, they said, adding one biggest advantage of this kit is that it is simple to use and uses readily available simple reagents and primers which can be synthesised in India. The diagnosis time is approximately 2 hours, they added.  A separate study by Reliance Life Sciences has indicated that the death rate for COVID-19 pandemic may significantly reduce by the end of 2020. The study showed mutation occurrence of structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 form more than 7,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus from 49 countries.  Statistical analysis showed an inverse correlation between the mutation rates of two proteins NSP6 and Surface glycoprotein (S) with the death rate, according to the study published in the Scientific Journal of Biology. It has been predicted that mutations of these two proteins will grow constantly, while the death rate would drop below 0.5 percent by end of 2020 in cluster I countries (India and Bangladesh).  In the study, it has been observed that the cluster II country (USA) mutation rate of NSP6 and S proteins are lower than cluster I and cluster III (Australia and NZ) countries. Therefore, it has been proposed that in cluster II country the death rate of COVID-19 pandemic will weaken later than cluster I and III countries, the study says.  Reliance also got a US patent for genetically modified microalgae that is said to defend/delay death. The United States Patent on September 8 issued the patent.

The deal is being seen as coming together of a future digital giant and a retail goliath popularly known to be the veteran of the consumer story in India.  &amp;quot;Future brings with it brands where the business models have been established over the years, a strong supply chain and a robust understanding of the Indian consumer segment. They are the pioneers who introduced the Indian common man to multi-storied hypermarkets. The ability to service the aspirations of the common man is what Future had successfully done all these years. This with the new digital ways of life powered by Reliance can create a powerful consumer ecosystem,&amp;quot; said Sreedhar Prasad, an independent e-commerce analyst.  With this deal, Future brings on table Big Bazaar, Fashion at Big Bazaar, EasyDay and Brand Factory. The deal is likely to provide Reliance Retail an additional store strength of around 18,000 across grocery and lifestyle segments.  The deal comes at a time when world over the retailers are struggling to cope up with the decline in business and the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Things became worse for Future which had been in bad financial health since the last few years. The company had a debt of Rs 12,778 crore as of September 2019, a significant increase from Rs 10,951, six months ago.  Reliance has agreed to take up the group's debt as part of the deal.  The retail market is still primarily served by the conventional brick-and-mortar stores which account for over 88 percent of the total market. The organised retail is pegged at $60 billion which is expected to witness a rise of 22-25&nbsp;percent with a market size of $140-160 billion by 2021, according to recent industry reports.  This growth is expected to be driven by economic and socio-demographic factors like growth in income, rise in nuclear families and urbanisation.  This happens at a time when even the e-tailing industry is also witnessing a massive surge. The sector which was expected to cross $200 billion by 2026 is only going to see the numbers multiply given the uptake of e-commerce as a platform in the post-pandemic scenario.  With the two companies combined together, the majority of the market share of the organised retail will fall in their kitty.  The deal is also expected to give firepower to Reliance when it fights Amazon in the grocery segment. &amp;quot;In grocery, you need small locations from where you can pick items and deliver to consumers. Some companies do it with dark stores, some do it by partnering with third-party outlets. But when you have your own store and can see what kind of inventory you have you are in a very powerful position,&amp;quot; said Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester Research.  Interestingly, Future was also reported to be in talks for a stake sale with Amazon. Amazon also already holds a 49 percent stake in a vertical called Future Coupons of the group as per a deal which was signed last year, giving Amazon around 3-4 percent stake in Future Retail.  Currently, it allows Amazon India to be the authorised online sales channel for Future's products.  It wasn't immediately clear as to what happens to this arrangement post the RIL-Future deal."

Reliance Retail is India&rsquo;s largest, most profitable retail business and is the fastest-growing retailer in the world thus far.  Its revenues are higher than the rest of the organised retailers combined.  Reliance Retail&rsquo;s business footprint spans across 11,806 retail stores in over 7,000 towns with 28.7 million sq ft of retail space.  It sells more fruits and vegetables than any of its peers. It sells more flour and oil, it sells more television, more washing machines, and more clothes.  Despite these fantastic sounding numbers that it has achieved in the 14 years since its launch, there are still some missing pieces to the retail ambitions of Chairman Mukesh Ambani.  Much of its revenue comes from consumer electronics segment. It makes up for almost 75 percent of the outlets, and about 25 percent of the revenue.  But its presence in other big segments, including groceries and fashion and lifestyle, is less intimidating.  With a total count of 800 stores, the grocery segment constitutes less than 10 percent of the stores, and 20 percent of sales.  Of all its retail stores, fashion and lifestyle retail contribute only 20 percent, but in terms of total sales&nbsp;it contributes 8 percent&nbsp;which is around&nbsp;Rs 13,500&nbsp;crore.  Even in fruits and vegetables, the unorganized segment takes over 25 percent of the total pie.  That is where the deal with Future will help Ambani get closer to his vision for the retail business.  The mega transaction with a combined value of Rs 24,713 crore cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to the ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  &ldquo;Food and grocery retail is a fragmented market, so the acquisition is more of a consolidation of market share rather than establishing leadership. Reliance Retail is by far the largest retailer already, and the takeover of Future Group's retail assets is more of a consolidation of its leadership position,&rdquo; said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of retail consultancy firm Third Eyesight.  In the last 4-5 months of lockdown, neighbourhood stores have done well, while large-format stores have lost ground. In the coming months, it will be important to see how Reliance bridges the gap with neighbourhood stores and expands its market reach using its digital footprint,&rdquo; he added.  According to Euromonitor, India&rsquo;s retail market size is about $635 billion (Rs 42 lakh crore) that is split 59:41 between grocery and other categories such as apparel, footwear and electronics.  What falls under Reliance Retail?  Reliance Retail, which was started in 2006, is the retail initiative of the group and is central to the consumer facing businesses.  Reliance Retail has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and operates chain of neighbourhood stores, supermarkets, wholesale cash and carry stores, specialty stores and online stores and has democratized access to a variety of products and services across diverse segments for Indian consumers.  Serving the food and grocery category, Reliance Retail operates Reliance Fresh, Reliance Smart and Reliance Market stores.  In the consumer electronics category, Reliance Retail operates Reliance Digital, Reliance Digital Express Mini stores and Jio stores, and in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle category, it operates Reliance Trends, Trends Women, Trends Man, Trends junior, Project Eve, Reliance Footprint, Reliance Jewels and AJIO.com, in addition to a large number of partner brand stores across the country.  What falls under merged Future Enterprises?  FRL is engaged mainly in the home and electronics retailing, value retailing and operates Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Foodhall, among other format retail stores. The deal will also involve Future Consumer, which operates the food business, and has significant links with FRL, which is its largest customer, accounting for almost 80 percent of its annual sales.  Future Lifestyle Fashions&nbsp;(FLF) was the flagship fashion business of Future Group. It so far operated in more than 400 stores in 90+ cities, occupying 5.7 mn sq ft of retail space. It ran in-house retail chains Central and Brand Factory, exclusive brand outlets (EBOs) and other multi-brand outlets (MBOs).  Similarly,&nbsp;Future Supply Chain Solutions&nbsp;provides supply-chain solutions [for non-agro products] to Future Group companies as well as to outside companies. The supply-chain company gets 65 percent of its business from FRL.  Large becomes larger  Reliance Retail, which was already the largest retailer in India by a long shot, gets even larger and bigger.  Its network gets a big push in the cities, where&nbsp;40 percent of Future stores are present. In comparison, more than two-thirds of Reliance Retail&rsquo;s nearly 12,000 stores are operating in Tier II, III and IV towns.  The company can now pick and choose which of Future&rsquo;s stores to retain and rationalize the network.  Much of the businesses will be integrated, and that will include the grocery business under Reliance Fresh, and the fashion vertical under the banner of Reliance Trends.  Reliance Retail will get the benefit of economies of scale. The products can be bought in large quantities and sold at competitive prices, and would see further improvement in margins due to improving scale.  The deal will help strengthen the vision created through the launch of JioMart, the online grocery delivery service that propels the company&rsquo;s omni-channel plans. JioMart, which is currently available only at selective cities, will now be able expand its reach.  To meet customer's requirements for essentials, the beta version of the JioMart grocery consumer platform (jiomart.com) was launched across 200 cities, followed by an app later on.  Within a few weeks of launch, JioMart was delivering over 4 lakh orders daily, which according to&nbsp;Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL) is significantly higher than any other grocery home delivery company.  JioMart, which went live in May, that saw an order flow four times that of the pre-lockdown period for partner kiranas, pointing to the potential an online-offline network has for stakeholders  Reliance Retail will ensure last-mile connectivity through tie-ups with Kirana stores in the remote region of the country. This ensures formalization of the retail sector as a whole.  Growth in retail will complement Jio&rsquo;s growth because both are consumer-centric.  The deal will help RIL&rsquo;s retail business to expand its offline retail presence and get it ready to tap O2O and B2B opportunities. With Reliance Retail having only begun its digital commerce business (JioMart&rsquo;s&nbsp;online grocery delivery business and the&nbsp;Kirana&nbsp;B2B distribution business), brokerage houses believe value creation from this business will happen only over the medium term.  What now?  After attracting a series of marquee investors to back Jio Platforms, Reliance Industries&rsquo; telecom arm, Chairman Mukesh Ambani, addressing the company&rsquo;s 43rd Annual General Meeting on July 15, indicated that the group&rsquo;s retail venture, too, has received strong interest from strategic and financial investors and plans are underway to induct some in the next few quarters.  The bar has been set high by Jio, which saw 14 deals to sell a 33 percent stake in Jio Platforms (JPL). This, together with the stake sale in the fuel joint venture and a rights issue, will help RIL raise Rs 2.1 trillion ($28 billion), and become net-debt free.  With the Future deal shoring up Reliance Retail numbers and domination in the Indian retail landscape, it may be now time for the next step.

The investment values Reliance Retail at a pre-money equity value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore.  Not very long ago, Reliance Industries (RIL) acquired a minority stake in the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, through its subsidiary Reliance Retail.  As we speak about the deal, here's all you need to know about how RIL, which once focussed on petrochemicals and oil and gas, entered the consumer business, and what it holds for the conglomerate now.  How it all began  RIL entered the organised retail segment in 2006. This was around the time that RIL was being divided between the brothers Mukesh and Anil Ambani. Christened Reliance Retail, the company started off with the launch of the first Reliance Fresh store in Hyderabad. The idea was to make buying groceries and vegetables a lifestyle experience at neighbourhood market prices. With an investment of Rs 25,000 crore, RIL's aim was to roll out this format for segments such as consumer durables, pharmacy and lifestyle products as well.  Going beyond Reliance Fresh  Reliance gradually widened its horizon across segments such as electronics, fashion and the cash-and-carry businesses. While Reliance Digital, the consumer electronic retail chain was launched in 2007, the company ventured into fashion and the wholesale cash-n-carry segments in 2008 and 2011, respectively, through Reliance Trends and Reliance Market. By 2011, Reliance Retail had achieved $1 billion in sales.  Growth of the giant  By 2014, Reliance became the largest retailer, surpassing Future Group in terms of revenue. Future Group's overall retail revenues totalled up to Rs 13,666 crore on an annualised basis for the financial year ended March 2014, at a time when Reliance Retail's revenue had shot up to Rs 14,496 crore.  Around the same time, Reliance tried to test the e-commerce space with the launch of an online grocery store, reliancefreshdirect.com to deliver groceries in Mumbai. In 2016, it made a full-fledged entry into e-commerce with the launch of curated fashion platform ajio.com. The online commerce space had already heated up with millions of dollars of venture capital money flowing into India.  Reliance was not the only offline retailer looking for an online presence. Aditya Birla Group had also launched its fashion portal, called abof.com, and Shoppers Stop had tied up with Snapdeal to open its online store. All of these companies were competing with the likes of Myntra, which had been acquired by Flipkart two years earlier.  In September 2016, RIL launched its telecom service, Jio, announcing free telecom services till at least that December. This would go a long way in shaping up how the internet was consumed in India. Meanwhile, Reliance Retail continued to grow. It notched up $10 billion in revenue in 2018.  Mergers and Acquisitions  The company went international with the acquisition of British Toy retailer Hamleys in 2019. Earlier this month, it also made a majority acquisition in online pharma company Netmeds for around Rs 620 crore and will take on the likes of Amazon and Flipkart in the segment.  Reliance Retail also has a portfolio of 46 exclusive international partner brands in the luxury segment, including the likes of Armani and Burberry.  Weathering the Covid storm  As with other retailers, Reliance Retail's numbers, too, were hit by the pandemic. Compared to the same period a year ago, Reliance Retail&rsquo;s revenue declined 17 percent to Rs 31,663 crore during the quarter ended June 30. The company reported a net profit of Rs 431 crore despite 50 percent of its stores being fully shut and 29 percent operating partially.  Growth of JioMart  Reliance Retail's online consumer grocery platform JioMart, which was launched in April, has become immensely popular. With over 10 lakh downloads, it is behind only Amazon and Flipkart in terms of app downloads.  JioMart currently offers groceries and other essentials and plans to introduce new categories, including electronics and fashion. It is learnt to be currently receiving 2.5 lakh daily orders from 200 locations across India.

The mega transaction, which also includes the wholesale, logistics and warehousing business of the Future Group, has a combined value of Rs 24,713 crore and cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to its ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into&nbsp; Future Enterprises Limited (FEL).  As a part of the scheme,  	the&nbsp; retail and wholesale Undertaking is being transferred to&nbsp; Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Limited (RRFLL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RRVL( Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd) 	the logistics &amp;amp;amp; warehousing undertaking is being transferred to RRVL 	RRFLL also proposes to invest Rs 1200 crore in the preferential issue of equity shares of FEL to acquire 6.09 percent of post-merger equity and Rs 400 crore to acquire warrants convertible into equity shares of FEL, which will result in RRFLL acquiring further 7.05 percent of FEL.  &ldquo;The acquisition of the retail, wholesale and supply chain business of the Future Group complements and makes a strong strategic fit into Reliance&rsquo;s retail business. This will help Reliance retail to accelerate providing support to millions of small merchants in increasing their competitiveness and enhance their income during these challenging times,&rdquo; said Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd in its official statement.  &ldquo;Future&rsquo;s portfolio composition in apparel, general merchandise and own FMCG brands will allow for a wider offering to its customers,&rdquo; the firm further added. RRVL reported a consolidated turnover of Rs 162,936 crore and net profit of Rs 5,447.96 crore for the year ended March 31, 2020.  The deal with Future Group also makes Reliance Retail more attractive for potential global partners and suitors. Addressing shareholders in RIL's 43rd annual general meeting, Mukesh Ambani had said the company has &amp;quot;received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail.&amp;quot;  Speaking on the mega deal, Isha Ambani, Director, Reliance Retail Ventures said, &amp;quot;With this transaction, we are pleased to provide a home to the renowned formats and brands of Future Group as well as preserve its business ecosystem, which have played an important role in the evolution of modern retail in India. We hope to continue the growth momentum of the retail industry with our unique model of active collaboration with small merchants and kiranas as well as large consumer brands. We are committed to continue providing value to our consumers across the country.&amp;quot;  THE ROAD AHEAD FOR FUTURE GROUP  The deal was crucial for Biyani-led Future Group which came under immense pressure from the lenders' consortium led by SBI to address its rising debt which stood at Rs 12,778 crore as of September 2019.  In its official statement, Future Group said, &ldquo; Post this exercise, FEL will emerge strong with businesses in manufacturing and distribution of FMCG products and integrated fashion sourcing and merchandising. These businesses will further benefit from supply agreement with RRFLL. This deal will also enable FEL to focus on the creation of new-age brands in the FMCG and fashion space and expand its reach. The transaction will help FEL to expand with a focussed business model and a stronger balance sheet.&rdquo;  &ldquo;As a result of this reorganisation and transaction, Future Group will achieve a holistic solution to the challenges that have been caused by COVID and the macro-economic environment. This transaction takes into account the interest of all its stakeholders including lenders, shareholders, creditors, suppliers and employees giving continuity to all its businesses,&rdquo; said Kishore Biyani, Group CEO, Future Group.  &ldquo;We are pleased that our strong retail franchise and brands, that we have created over time, are going in stronger hands and will continue to grow and delight Indian shoppers,&rdquo; Biyani added.  THE RESCUE ACT BY RELIANCE RETAIL   Biyani&rsquo;s exit from a business he had painstakingly built over three decades was forced by a rising pile of debt and the searing pain wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through Saturday&rsquo;s deal, Reliance Retail, controlled by Ambani, Asia&rsquo;s richest man, has emerged as a white knight and thwarted the collapse of a vast retail group that would have otherwise been dragged through India&rsquo;s bankruptcy court.  The folding up of a group that showed to the world the potential of India&rsquo;s retail market would have cast a long shadow on how the world perceives this crucial service sector growth engine of the economy and re-rate its prospects down. It would have also been read as an example of India&rsquo;s diminishing potential as a marketplace.  The takeover now by Reliance Retail, will essentially give a fresh lease of life to what is an absorbing Indian entrepreneurial story. The deal is good news for lenders of Future Group who will now have secured outstanding loans protected as well as the retail ecosystem comprising small businesses and suppliers. Employees who would have otherwise stared at salary cuts and job losses now could get absorbed because Reliance Retail is aggressively expanding across India.  &ldquo;The buyout of the logistics and warehousing segments of Future Group will help Reliance Retail take on Amazon which has been traditionally strong in these segments. Post this deal, Reliance Retail will now sell a wider range of products under one roof and domestic retail players who focus on specific segments will stand to get marginalised,&amp;quot;&nbsp;said market veteran SP Tulsian.  Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries has been diversifying its business and shoring up its retail presence ahead of a big-bang listing. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, it pushed the grocery business heavily and also launched JioMart, rivalling the likes of Amazon and Walmart backed Flipkart. Recently, it also made a foray into online pharmacy and acquired a majority stake in Netmeds for Rs 620 crore. Reliance Retail&rsquo;s business footprint spans across 11,806 retail stores in over 7,000 towns with 28.7 million sq ft of retail space.  Khaitan &amp;amp;amp; Co and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas advised Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd on the transaction, both law firms said in separate releases. JM Financial acted as an advisor to the entire Future Group and promoters on the transaction. ICICI Securities is the sole advisor to this transaction and has also issued fairness opinions on the share swap ratios in relation to the proposed amalgamation."

But, if the bidders for the recently-concluded IPL title sponsorship bids are seen as any indication, it can be seen that none of the old-economy companies explored the prospect of associating with the most popular T20 tournament in the world.  Dream11, Unacademy and Byju's were the three entities which submitted bids while Tata Sons, which had evinced interest, did not place a bid, much to the BCCI&rsquo;s chagrin.  Tata Sons and BCCI could not come to an agreement over the number of categories available for sponsorship. The fact that it was the only old-economy to confirm its interest in the rights shows the dwindling interest of the corporate houses and the emergence of startups and new-age companies in the cricket ecosystem.  Before Vivo, the IPL was sponsored by leading brands such as DLF and Pepsi while the Indian cricket team's official jersey sponsorship rights were held by the likes of ITC and Sahara. Star India also held the rights for three years.  The last time two big corporate entities jostled for the official jersey rights was in 2010 when Sahara secured the rights by paying Rs 3.34 crore compared to Airtel's Rs 2.89 crore per international game offer.  Corporate India's big foray into cricket board sponsorship came in 1987 when Reliance Industries became the title sponsor of the World Cup, which was being held outside England for the first time.  Other companies like Hero MotoCorp and Reliance Communications have also been associated with the International Cricket Council as commercial partners.  In 2019, Byju's replaced Oppo as the jersey sponsor, thus sending a signal that the startups are willing to splash the cash to catch the eyeballs.  Also Read: IPL 2020 | How Dream11 fended off Chinese connection concerns to clinch title sponsorship rights   But, in the past few years, the BCCI has not seen many top companies lining up to bid for the jersey or title sponsorship rights.  In 2017, when Star's contract with BCCI was coming to an end and bids were called, two Chinese handset manufacturers were in the fray &ndash; Oppo and Vivo. Oppo offered to pay Rs 1,079 crore, almost double the BCCI's reserve price of Rs 538 crore.  In 2019, Paytm bagged the BCCI title sponsorship rights until 2023 for Rs 326.8 crore.    &amp;quot;It is not just Indian companies, even MNCs such as Pepsi, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Vodafone and Nike have been steadily showing declining interest. Whether it is value perception only or combined with an indifferent attitude of cricket administrators towards sponsors that is keeping them away, is tough to say,&amp;quot; Harish Thawani, founder of Nimbus Communications, told Moneycontrol.  Thawani said apart from new-age brands like Paytm, Byju&rsquo;s and Dream11, the rest simply cannot afford the investment in cricket.  Also Read | Dream11 wins IPL title sponsorship: Here's how big is the fantasy sports gaming market in India   &amp;quot;The landscape changes every few years. It was dominated by Pepsi, LG, Samsung, Hero MotoCorp, Vodafone and Airtel Now, the Chinese brands and some new-age brands are dominating. Two years from now, there will be others,&amp;quot; he said.  Saurabh Uboweja, Managing Partner of managing consulting firm BOD Consulting, feels the cricket sponsorship segment is following the worldwide trend of brands catering to youngsters garnering the bulk of sports sponsorship deals.  &amp;quot;The new-age companies follow the new trends. If you look at the digital gaming segment, it is massive and it makes sense for Dream11 to bid for the rights. Earlier, it used to be the likes of Oppo and Vivo, which used to target the new-age customers. Whenever brands take sponsorship of sports events, they look at the target audience. Earlier, Pepsi and Coca-Cola used to heavily sponsor cricket tournaments but of late due to people&rsquo;s perception of cola-based drinks, they have stopped spending heavily in that segment. A brand like Amul is now trying to reinvent itself and has focused a lot on sports sponsorships. A brand which is already young in terms of image will always try to go all out in terms of associating with sports properties,&amp;quot; he told Moneycontrol.  Jagdeep Kapoor, brand guru and Chairman and Managing Director, Samsika Marketing Consultants, said the big Indian companies have missed a golden chance of propelling their brands opportunity by passing up the opportunity to associate with this year's IPL.  &amp;quot;Big Indian companies missed a great opportunity as IPL is a great property. In brand building and sponsorship, companies need to have a long-term view. The traditional companies have a vision but they are going for revision and slashing their marketing budgets. You can&rsquo;t be cutting your nose to spite the face. Dream11 has got a goldmine and is a good move from their point of view. According to me, the established players have missed out on a great opportunity,&amp;quot; he told Moneycontrol.  With COVID-19 putting a dent on the finances of India Inc, it was widely speculated that the BCCI would have a tough time in getting a deal similar to the one they had inked with Vivo. Ultimately, Dream11 has offered to pay Rs 222 crore for this year and the cricket board will have to look for associate sponsorship slots to reduce the deficit.  So, has the BCCI been able to salvage the situation vis-a-vis the IPL sponsorship?  &amp;quot;In the pandemic affected market, to get 50 percent of what Vivo was paying is a reasonable result. But one hears other central sponsors have pulled out too. So, let's see how that pans out,&amp;quot; said Thawani.

The deal values Netmeds around Rs 1,000 crore.  The acquisition gives RIL&rsquo;s retail unit Reliance Retail entry into a vertical e-commerce space, one of the few that has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to its online grocery platform JioMart.  Founded by Pradeep Dadha, Netmeds currently delivers medicines, personal and baby care items, and provides doctor bookings and diagnostics on its website and app. It has been looking for a buyer for nearly a year now, after it was unable to raise a large round of funding.  Its investors include Singapore-based Daun Penh Cambodia Group, Sistema Asia Fund, Tanncam Investment and healthcare-focused investment firm OrbiMed.  Listen: Setting Sail podcast | Wow Momo may cut jobs in September, business still not back to pre-Covid level: Sagar Daryani  Isha Ambani,&nbsp; Director, Reliance Retail Ventures, said in a statement, &ldquo;The addition of Netmeds enhances Reliance Retail&rsquo;s ability to provide good&nbsp; quality and affordable healthcare products and services, and also broadens its digital&nbsp; commerce proposition to include most daily essential needs of consumers.&rdquo;  A scrum of startups have fiercely fought in e-pharmacies for a few years now on the thesis that delivering medicines for chronic illnesses regularly could be a springboard to becoming a large internet company. Netmeds, PharmEasy, Medlife, 1mg, etc have been jostling for space. However, margins in medicine delivery are minimal, and investors will not fund money-losing startups unless they are market leaders.  The pandemic however turned this notion on its head. The segment has benefited from many first-time customers flocking to these apps as they were forced to order medicines from home during lockdown. Moneycontrol reported on August 7 that these apps have seen orders surge 50 percent and taken the sector forward by two years in the last three months.  According to people close to the deal, although RIL was eyeing the sector, and Netmeds, even before the pandemic hit, the lockdown helped close the deal, find the right valuation and proved the business thesis.  Last week, Amazon India rolled out its e-pharmacy service in Bengaluru, with plans to launch in the rest of the country soon.  The entry of these conglomerates, to some extent, gives the sector long-term prospects. Barring PharmEasy, every other startup in the sector has been battling for survival, struggling to raise funds and been eyeing mergers with larger rivals.  &ldquo;It is a good outcome for both sides. Netmeds needed to survive and find a home. RIL wanted to enter the sector, but not pay a very high tech-style valuation,&rdquo; said an investor in the space, requesting anonymity.  The deal fuels Jio&rsquo;s desire to have a full-fledged ecommerce platform, delivering goods of all kinds. Acquiring distressed startups has been a step in this direction. It is reportedly in talks to acquire online furniture startup Urban Ladder, online lingerie retailer Zivame and online milk delivery startup Milkbasket.

The deal was to close by March but has been delayed.  &amp;quot;With regard to the Reliance deal, all I can say at this stage (is that) it's going through the due diligence,&amp;quot; Nasser said in June quarter earnings call with investors.  &amp;quot;So, depending on the due diligence, we will make our decision after we complete the due diligence on that deal.&amp;quot;  According to the transcript of the investor call, he went on to state that the deal to buy a stake in the world's largest single-location oil refining complex and India's biggest petrochemical assets &amp;quot;is a big deal. So, we need to take our time to review and then decide based on the outcome of the due diligence study&amp;quot;.  Ambani had at RIL's annual general meeting last month stated that the Aramco deal had been delayed &amp;quot;due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the COVID-19 situation&amp;quot;.  He neither said if the deal was on track nor gave any fresh timelines for its completion. Nasser too did not give timelines for completion of the deal saying discussions with Reliance were still on and shareholders will be updated &amp;quot;in due course&amp;quot;.  RIL's O2C business comprises of the company's twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, petrochemical plants, and 51 percent in fuel retailing venture. The deal may have been delayed over valuations, sources said.  Last month after RIL's AGM, Bernstein had stated that: &amp;quot;The sell-down of a 20 percent stake in the refinery and chemical business to Aramco for $15 billion has not progressed as planned, given changes in market conditions. We believe a deal is still possible although at a lower valuation, closer to our estimate of $57 billion gross&amp;quot;.  To facilitate the deal, Reliance had earlier this year decided to spin off the O2C business into a separate subsidiary, and Ambani last month said that process is likely to be completed by early 2021.  But for him, the urgency of the Aramco deal has diminished after RIL amassed over Rs 2.12 lakh crore from sale of nearly 33 percent stake in the conglomerate's digital arm Jio Platforms, rights issue and selling 49 percent stake in fuel retail business to BP.  This money helped the oil-telecom-to-retail conglomerate to become a zero net debt company nine months ahead of the target.  &amp;quot;Our equity requirements have already been met,&amp;quot; Ambani had said in the AGM. With a stake, Aramco would not just have a share in one of the world's best refineries and the largest integrated petrochemical complex but also access to one of the fastest-growing markets -- a ready-made market for 5 lakh barrels per day of its Arabian crude and a potentially bigger downstream role in future.  It will make the world's biggest crude exporter join the ranks of the top oil refiners and chemical makers, and help it reach its goal of more than doubling refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels a day.  Last week, BofA Securities in a report said with the Saudi Aramco deal, &amp;quot;RIL will be able to better utilise its refinery capabilities with availability of several grades of crude oil from super light to heavy being supplied by Aramco&amp;quot;.  The partnership going ahead will leverage the O2C value chain to maximise margins and meet the evolving needs of consumers by supplying energy, base chemicals and new materials.  The strategic partnership with Aramco will help in increasing its crude oil to chemicals conversion ratio, which presently stands at 20 per cent. &amp;quot;With the deal, RIL will get technological expertise from SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corporation), in which Aramco recently bought a controlling stake,&amp;quot; it had said.  For Aramco, it creates a long-term crude supply contract of 0.5 million barrels per day (about 5 percent of current production) to RIL's Jamnagar refinery, with reduced demand risks. Aramco currently covers only about 40 percent of its crude output via refining and strives to increase it further.  &amp;quot;It would give Aramco the opportunity to participate in Indian market growth story where demand will likely be strong over the next two decades,&amp;quot; it added.

To meet customer's requirements for essentials, the beta version of the JioMart grocery consumer platform (jiomart.com) was launched across 200 cities, followed by an app later on. Within a few weeks of launch, JioMart was delivering over&nbsp;four lakh orders daily, which according to Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL) is significantly higher than any other grocery home delivery company.  &ldquo;Orders have continued to scale up since inception,&rdquo; it said. After the lockdown was announced on March 24, customers struggled to buy groceries and other essentials from established e-retailers like Big Basket, D-Mart Ready, Big Bazaar and Amazon. The sudden spike in orders led to delays and even cancellations as restrictions on the movement of people and goods hobbled these companies. Kirana shops came to the rescue of harried customers. JioMart connected them to their smaller but efficient neighbourhood grocery stores. &ldquo;Grocery witnessed strong customer traction as stores remained open, though with restrictions on operations and products to be sold. Apart from continued momentum in staples, categories such as hygiene products and packaged foods did particularly well leading to higher bill values,&rdquo; the company said. During its 43rd Annual General Meeting (AGM), RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said JioMart is now accepting over 2.5 lakh orders daily from across India and the number is rising fast with each passing day.&nbsp;&amp;quot;The USP of JioMart is its smart store price promise. JioMart offers attractive prices on essentials with a minimum 5 percent discount on all products.&amp;quot; The bouquet of JioMart products now includes a wide range of personal care products, home and kitchen care products, puja needs, shoe care, baby care products, branded foods etc.  Despite the challenging environment brought about the novel coronavirus pandemic, where store functioning and digital commerce fulfilment was severely impacted by the lockdown and restrictions (50 percent stores were fully shut and 29 percent partially operated), Reliance Retail clocked significant revenue of Rs 31,633 crore and an operating profit of Rs 1,083 crore in Q1 FY21. Growth plans JioMart is in the process of expanding its partnership with&nbsp;kirana stores across more cities.&nbsp;&ldquo;Expansion across cities is underway with many more kirana partners are being on-boarded,&rdquo; the company said. JioMart launch It was on April 26, four days after Reliance Retail signed a deal with Facebook-owned WhatsApp, that JioMart went live in Thane, Kalyan and Navi Mumbai after five months of a soft launch. On May 23, RIL expanded its JioMart service to customers across several cities after successfully conducting a pilot across Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan and launched website jiomart.com to place an order.  JioMart app JioMart, Reliance Retail&rsquo;s beta online consumer grocery platform, recently went live on Apple and Google Play Stores.  A few days since its launch, the app crossed 10 lakh downloads.&nbsp;JioMart is&nbsp;one of the most popular apps in Google&nbsp;Play Store&rsquo;s &lsquo;shopping&rsquo; category, third only behind Amazon and Flipkart.  The app is also the second most popular app in the &lsquo;shopping&rsquo; category on Apple&rsquo;s app store.  JioMart was launched with an aim to compete with Amazon and Flipkart, the companies that have dominated India&rsquo;s e-retail space."

The combined performance of these businesses helped the company top projections of analysts and fend off the coronavirus slowdown with the first quarter results released on July 30. RIL reported a consolidated profit of Rs&nbsp;13,248&nbsp;crore for the first quarter of FY21 with Jio's ARPU growth of 7.4 percent QoQ at Rs 140.3 per subscriber per month beating&nbsp;Street expectations.  &amp;quot;The severe demand destruction due to global lockdowns impacted our hydrocarbons business but the flexibility in our operations enabled us to operate at near normal levels and deliver industry leading results,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  &amp;quot;Our consumer facing businesses became the life-line for individuals and businesses with our Retail and Jio teams working hard to ensure millions got essential goods and services through the lockdown,&amp;quot; he added.  Consolidated profit during June quarter 2020 (which included exceptional gain of Rs 4,966&nbsp;crore from stake sale to BP in Reliance BP Mobility)&nbsp;increased 102.4 percent sequentially and the year-on-year increase was 30.6 percent.  Consolidated profit in March quarter 2020 stood at Rs 6,348 crore and Rs 10,141 crore in the corresponding period of last year.  In the March quarter, the company had reported an exceptional loss of Rs 4,267 crore due to fall in oil prices. Profit before the exceptional item was at Rs 10,813 crore.  RIL beat D-Street estimates in what according to most analysts was a tough quarter. Jio, Retail, and oil-to-chemical (O2C) all contributed to fight COVID induced slowdown.  Reliance's consolidated revenue for the quarter stood at Rs 1,00,929 crore compared to Rs 1,51,461 crore QoQ and Rs 1,74,087 crore year-on-year.  A CNBC-TV18 analysts&rsquo; poll&nbsp;pegged revenue 16 percent lower YoY at Rs 1.14 lakh crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 15 percent lower at Rs 18,511 crore. PAT at Rs 8,374 crore.  Its EBITDA came in at Rs 16,875 crore in June quarter against Rs 21,782 crore in previous quarter, while margin at 19.1 percent in June quarter expanded sharply from 16 percent in March quarter, beating Street expectations.  Ambani said Reliance Industries completed the largest fund raise in Indian Corporate history in this quarter. I thank the millions of individual investors who supported our Rights Issue and welcome all our new partners to an exciting new phase of growth at Reliance.&rdquo;  RIL's digital unit Jio Platforms, which raised Rs 1,52,056 crore during the quarter under review from some of the world&rsquo;s top tech investors led by Facebook, was one of the few companies to have grown during the coronavirus lockdown.  With the fund raising from stake sale in Jio Platforms,&nbsp;Rights issue of Rs 53,124 crore and stake sale to BP in petro-retail&nbsp;joint venture, Reliance achieved its net debt free target in June 2020, which is well ahead of its timeline March 31, 2021.  Reliance Industries said it, post completion of these investments, would hold 66.48&nbsp;percent equity stake in Jio Platform on a fully diluted basis.  &amp;quot;Of the total investment, Jio Platform Limited has already received&nbsp;Rs&nbsp; 1,15,694 crore as subscription amount from ten investors. Rs 22,981 crore will be retained at Jio Platform to drive future growth,&amp;quot; it added.  Work from home boosted Jio&rsquo;s data consumption. Reliance Jio, the wholly owned subsidiary of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries, has reported profit at Rs&nbsp;2,520 crore for the June quarter 2020, rising 8.1 percent over&nbsp;Rs 2,331 crore in March quarter.  Average revenue per user (ARPU) for the June quarter at Rs 140.3 per subscriber per month grew by 7.4 percent compared to Rs 130.6 in previous quarter. It was much higher than street expectations.  Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital told CNBC-TV18 that there is no&nbsp;reason why Jio ARPU won't go up further. &amp;quot;Retail will be the next big galloping horse. We don't expect any selling pressure on RIL stock and Rs&nbsp;2,300 zone may get tested in August,&amp;quot; he said.  The stock touched a record high of Rs 2,198.70 on July 27 and brokerages increased their target price due to deleveraging of the Balance Sheet and stake sale in Jio Platforms to global investors and technology players.  In fact, it has been the biggest gainer among Nifty stocks, rising 145 percent from its March 23 low, and gaining 41 percent year-to-date.

Revenue was expected at Rs 15,800&nbsp;crore with&nbsp;EBITDA at Rs 6,700&nbsp;crore and margin at 42.4 percent for the quarter, according to CNBC-TV18 poll estimates.  Two RIL platforms -- JioMart and JioMeet -- which were rolled out during Q1 benefitted from huge downloads.  JioMart beta version was launched in 200 cities to meet consumer needs. Both voice and data traffic surged.  Reliance Retail:&nbsp;Against the backdrop of a challenging environment, where store functioning and digital commerce fulfilment was severely impacted by lockdown and restrictions (50 percent stores were fully shut, 29 percent partially operated), Reliance Retail clocked significant revenues of Rs 31,633 crore and EBITDA of Rs 1,083 crore in the quarter, company said.  &amp;quot;The performance whilst muted by the operating context, was well ahead of market,&amp;quot; it added. Retail revenue in June quarter 2019 was at Rs 38,216 crore and EBITDA at Rs 2,060 crore.  RIL said EBITDA was positive and resilient despite the limitations in the quarter, with cost management initiatives leading to fixed cost savings, which helped cushion the impact of lower profits from lower sales.  Despite gross margin expansion and cost savings, EBITDA margin was impacted by fixed costs and adverse mix (with the most profitable Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Lifestyle categories being hit the hardest), coming in at 3.8 percent during the quarter against 6.0 percent during the corresponding period of the previous year, it added.  Reliance said the quarter saw 21 percent growth year-on-year across the operational businesses of Grocery and Connectivity, while Consumer Electronics and Fashion and Lifestyle businesses were hit particularly hard by the cessation of activity during the lockdown period, as stores were closed for the most part of the quarter.  On the petrochemicals front, Reliance said revenue for Q1FY21 declined by 33 percent YoY to Rs 25,192 crore primarily due to lower price realizations with disruptions in local and regional markets amid COVID-19 outbreak.  EBITDA for the quarter declined 49.7 percent YoY to Rs 4,430 crore. &amp;quot;Weak domestic demand and higher share of exports impacted margins as compared to regional benchmarks. The impact of lower realization was partially offset by cost optimization and integration benefits,&amp;quot; company said.  Q1 was a very challenging quarter as due to lockdown, domestic industry and supply chains virtually came to a halt as both producers and converters shut down plants across India, it added.  In case of refining and marketing business, Reliance said revenues for June quarter 2020 declined by 54.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 46,642 crore due to lower crude oil price and lower throughput.  Brent crude price averaged at $29.2 a barrel during the quarter versus $68.8 a barrel in Q1FY20, down 57.6 percent YoY.  Regional Benchmark Singapore Complex Margins turned negative for the first time in 2 decades and averaged at $-0.9 a barrel.  Reliance said its gross refining margins at $6.3 a barrel was impacted by lower product cracks and narrower light-heavy crude differential. However, it maintained a significant premium of $7.2 a barrel over regional benchmark margin.  Refining and marketing EBITDA declined to Rs 3,818 crore (down 25.8 percent YoY) due to weak margin environment and lower throughput, RIL said, adding refining segment profitability was sustained through optimized crude procurement, relatively higher utilization, cost management and agile product placement.  RIL is now one of the 50 most valued companies globally with a market capitalisation of Rs 13.92 lakh crore at its record high price.  Promoters' shareholding stood at 50.37 percent in the June quarter up from 50.07 percent in the March quarter, while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) raised their stake to 24.72 percent from 24.05 percent in the same period.

Many companies, including the likes of&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra Financial Services,&nbsp;PVR,&nbsp;Shriram Transport Finance,&nbsp;Aditya Birla Fashion, Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL), have offered their shareholders a chance to solidify their holding at a time when investor confidence is riding high despite the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country.  Ample liquidity due to stimulus packages from central banks and relatively cheap valuations in the aftermath of COVID-19-led crash&nbsp;could have been the fillip companies needed to opt for rights issue as the preferred means of raising funds as opposed to&nbsp;qualified institutional placements (QIP), experts suggested.  &amp;quot;It is understood that when valuations are stretched, companies usually raise capital via QIP route. And when shares are reasonably priced or are undervalued, promoters generally raise additional capital for growth through a rights issue, giving a chance to existing shareholders to buy the stock at a discounted price,&amp;quot; said&nbsp;Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities.  According to Shah, investors should not always view raising funds as a quick fix to a bleeding balance sheet but should rather concentrate on why the company is raising funds. In many cases, companies use the funds for capital expenditure which is a telling sign that the management is optimistic about the growth prospects of the company.  &amp;quot;...raising of funds also shows the management&rsquo;s confidence in the growth of their company. It is not always the case that additional capital is raised only because the company&rsquo;s balance sheet is bleeding.

The&nbsp;issue will open for subscription&nbsp;July 28, and the closing date is August 11.  According to the management of the company, the rights issue is&nbsp;their way of thanking shareholders in the company's silver jubilee year. And thankful they were, as the scrip climbed over&nbsp;10 percent on July 20, the announcement date. Although, the sharp rise can also be attributed to the stellar returns the company posted for the&nbsp;quarter ended June 2020.  The pricing of the issues was also hailed by analysts Moneycontrol spoke to. They believe that the company has multiple moats including a strong rural presence.&nbsp;Efficient cost control along with low borrowing cost also puts the company is a favourable position  &ldquo;The announcement of the rights issue at a steep discount of Rs 50 against July 17's closing of Rs 207 per share is likely to be taken positively by the market. More than the rights issue, the steady growth in business along with signs of improvement in the niche segment of the company is likely to aid stock rally on a short-term basis,&rdquo; Dinesh Rohira, Founder-CEO,&nbsp; 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.  Earlier this month, India&rsquo;s largest operator of multi-screen theatres, PVR&nbsp;also announced a Rs 300 crore rights which opened for subscription on July 17 and will close on July 31. The price of the issue was fixed at Rs 784 per equity share.  According to media reports, the Ajay Bijli-owned firm intends&nbsp;to utilise the net proceeds from the issue towards repayment or prepayment of the principal and or interest of certain borrowings availed by the company. PVR may also use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  PVR, which has 176 properties and a total of 845 screens across India, had completed a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in October 2019. The fundraising round led to an inflow of Rs 500 crore.  Part of the&nbsp;QIP proceeds was utilised towards prepayment of existing debt obligation.  Shriram Transport Finance&nbsp;launched its Rs 1,500 crore&nbsp;rights issue on 16 July at a price of Rs 570 per share. The rights issue will close on 30 July.  Even though the lender did not reveal the purpose of raising funds, it said that its promoter entities will be subscribing to the entire portion of rights shares they are eligible for.  &ldquo;Our promoter and Shriram Financial Ventures (Chennai) Pvt. Ltd, a member of our Promoter Group have undertaken to fully subscribe to their Rights Entitlement and shall not renounce their rights, except to the extent of any renunciation inter-se between our Promoter and other members of the Promoter Group,&amp;quot; the company had said in an exchange filing.   BNP Paribas Arbitrage acquired 1.47 lakh&nbsp;Shriram Transport Finance&nbsp;Rights Entitlement (RE) shares at Rs 107.73 per share on July 21 via open market transactions, bulk deals data available on the NSE showed.  Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd&nbsp;also came out with a Rs 995 crore rights issue this month.&nbsp;The issue opened for subscription on July 8 and will close on July 22.  The main objectives of the fundraising are to cut leverage, strengthen the balance sheet and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, the apparel company, which owns brands including Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Peter England, and Pantaloons, said.  Experts Moneycontrol spoke to advised subscribing to the issue given&nbsp;ABFRL's strong management as well as its growth prospects once the pandemic is contained and the economy fully re-opens.  &amp;quot;The rights issue is structured similarly to that of Reliance Industries where shareholders will have to make payments in three tranches. As the lockdown is gradually lifted, retail stocks seem to be in a rebound mode. The factors like manageable leverage, consistent execution capability, healthy cost-cutting initiatives and strong parentage might help ABFRL emerge much stronger from the current crisis,&amp;quot; said Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor.

In the 43rd annual general meeting, Reliance Industries Limited Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said that Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch.  &amp;quot;This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India&hellip; using 100 percent home grown technologies and solutions.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-headquartered bank expects the deal street to be driven by both consolidation in the sectors impacted by the pandemic and financial institutions raising growth capital.  Raj Balakrishnan, the head of India investment banking at BofA says, the pandemic is unlike any other previous crises, which were business crises.  &amp;quot;A company that was being run perfectly well till February may not be viable now for no fault of the management, as its business may be hit due to the lockdowns. Further, the same company may be perfectly fine once lockdown is over and normalcy returns as long as it has sufficient liquidity to sail through the crisis,&amp;quot; Balakrishnan told PTI, expressing confidence in the broader business recovery.  That is why, he said, raising capital is now the key to help emerge as a winner.  Thanks to Reliance Industries selling over a quarter of its stake in its subsidiary Jio Platforms, the deal street was vibrant clocking nearly $44 billion in H1 of 2020, up 14.5 percent YoY.  Between late April and June, Reliance sold nearly 25 percent in Jio Platforms to 10 investors, including Facebook, which snapped up 9.99 percent for over Rs 43,000 crore. Then it sold 15 percent more, collectively raising Rs 1.2 lakh crore including through the largest rights issue of Rs 53,124 crore in June.  Others who lapped up minority stake in Jio for $15.27 billion include Silver Lake Partners, General Atlantic, KKR and others. The selling spree continued in July with Google picking up 7.7 percent for over Rs 33,700 crore.  According to industry tracker Mergermarket, BofA stood second in the i-banking league table with deals worth $6.7 billion in the first half, capturing 17.6 percent market share. Morgan Stanley topped the list with $13 billion across nine deals.  BofA was one of the bookrunners of the largest rights issue by Reliance worth Rs 53,124 crore in June. The bank also exclusively advised Facebook for its stake-buy in Jio.  BofA also executed block deals for Standard Life Aberdeen (in HDFC Life and HDFC AMC) and for Blackstone in Embassy Office Parks REIT.  SBI Cards IPO, the largest initial share listing in nearly a decade, and Avenue Supermart's (DMart) QIP and OFS are some of the other big deals executed by BofA this year.  And deals continue to be worked on.  &amp;quot;We have a strong pipeline of deals and we are confident, the second half will be equally busy,&amp;quot; Balakrishnan said.  Companies hit by the pandemic would try to sell down their non-core businesses, and it would be another opportunity for investment bankers, he added.  Balakrishnan has multiple reasons for being optimistic on the deals front.  &amp;quot;A lot of minority stake sale is happening across India Inc and we will see some sales driven by portfolio choice as well. You will also see quite some activity in the e-commerce space where consolidation is likely,&amp;quot; he added.  In June alone, BofA handled six market transactions raising over $8.5 billion for clients. The deals included Standard Life Aberdeen selling 5.6 percent in HDFC AMC for $378 million through OFS, the RIL rights issue of $7.1 bullion, and Blackstone selling stake in Embassy Office Parks REIT for $500 million among others.  &amp;quot;We were the busiest i-banker on the street amid a challenging and volatile market backdrop. From the landmark $7.1 billion RIL rights issuance, which is the largest ever capital market transaction in the country to $18 million Andhra Paper OFS &mdash; we were there adding the most relevant investor colour and helping our clients access liquidity,&amp;quot; he said.  According to Mergermarket, Morgan Stanley and BofA have picked nearly half of the $43.5-billion deals in H1, through just 11 of the 72 deals.  But in terms of volume, the period saw 24.7 percent fewer deals at 183 as against 243 YoY.  Morgan Stanley led the league table completing nine deals worth $13.53 billion.

Stake sales in Reliance's digital unit Jio Platforms attracted not just private equity and sovereign wealth funds but also Google and Facebook, a strong endorsement for an enterprise that until a few years ago focussed largely on oil refining.  Some industry watchers equate Reliance's digital plans - which extend from online shopping and cloud computing to telecom and digital payments - to China's Alibaba and Tencent, companies Reliance itself calls &amp;quot;global peers&amp;quot;.  Reliance has a track record of disrupting rival businesses. With cheap smartphones and data plans, its telecom venture Jio has in four years dethroned market leaders Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to become the largest telecom operator in India.  On Wednesday, billionaire chairman Mukesh Ambani said Reliance will expand e-commerce platform JioMart - which connects small retailers with consumers - to offer not just groceries but also electronics and fashion goods.  &amp;quot;Jio Platforms not only has the backend infrastructure and development capabilities but also an ever expanding captive consumer base,&amp;quot; said Mayank Vishnoi of Singapore-based financial advisory firm Resfeber International.  &amp;quot;The addition of new digital products targeting various sectors will pose threats to many large dominant players. Having strategic partners like Facebook and Google validates that Reliance gameplan is real.&amp;quot;  The recent stake sales gave Reliance a foreign partner for JioMart, which was launched this year. Facebook's WhatsApp, which counts India as its top market with 400 million plus users, will work closely in connecting small retailers to JioMart.  &amp;quot;We will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand to many more categories,&amp;quot; said Ambani.  Asked about the potential impact on foreign businesses eyeing India, one local industry executive who advises US multinationals said: &amp;quot;Amazon and Walmart should be scared.&amp;quot;  To be sure, Reliance will face stiff competition from Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart, as both companies have deep pockets and an already well-established warehousing and logistics supply chain in the country.  JioMart currently delivers groceries in only 200 cities, while Amazon and Flipkart deliver a wide range of goods across the country.  Walmart, Flipkart and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  &amp;quot;REAL THREAT&amp;quot;  Reliance also has a retail footprint of around 11,000 stores across 6,700 cities that offer a wide array of products. It has also partnered with over 45 top international brands including Tiffany &amp;amp;amp; Co, Burberry and Jimmy Choo.  Senior leadership at Flipkart has started keeping close tabs on Reliance, and there is a fear the Indian company will have an added advantage from the regulatory perspective, two sources close to the company told Reuters.  The Ambani family is viewed as being well-connected politically. Amazon and Walmart have had regulatory troubles and face far tighter government oversight in India, where the prime minister has been promoting self reliance.  Reliance's digital plans extend beyond e-commerce.  On Wednesday, the company said it will develop education and healthcare solutions via its JioMeet video conferencing tool that saw 5 million users within days of its launch this month. JioMeet has a starkly similar design to its rival, US based Zoom Video Communications.  Zoom said this month it had plans for a significant investment in India. Asked about Reliance, Zoom said it had experienced intense competition in the past but we &amp;quot;know what it takes&amp;quot; to become a platform of choice.  &amp;quot;This threat is real,&amp;quot; one US tech executive in India said about Reliance. &amp;quot;As of now, it's not changing the game, but that view can change in a year from now.&amp;quot;  Disclaimer:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani emphasised on &amp;quot;Made in India&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Made-for-India&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Made-for-the-World&amp;quot; products, which might boost investors trust as nation tilted over Made in India products.  However, a set back for the conglomerate is the deal with Saudi Aramco, which has not progressed with the original timeline due to pandemic and some unfavourable events in the oil sector. But Ambani said he is committed to this partnership. Had the deal got announced it might have boosted street sentiments.  Some of the announcements which I really like are 'target to become net carbon-neutral by 2035' and another big announcement by the chairman is that Google will invest over Rs 33,000 crore in Jio Platforms.  Way ahead, Jio is ready with a world-class 5G solution and its field deployment might be carried in next year. Also, Ambani focused on Made-in-India 5G Solution.  Although, the market has discounted announcements but RIL is worth holding for mid to long term, with a target of Rs 2,600, implying 40.9 percent potential upside from current levels. Investors should try to add the stock in any healthy correction as RIL is likely to outperform the index and might lead the benchmark.

That enticing proposition became a reality on July 15 at the 43rd &mdash; all-virtual &mdash; annual general meeting (AGM) of Reliance Industries (RIL). Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a Rs 33,737 crore investment by Google for a 7.7 percent stake in Jio Platforms, marking the end of a gargantuan, unparalleled fundraising exercise.  This is the first and biggest investment by Google under its India digitisation fund, which was launched earlier this week. The fund is looking to pump in nearly $10 billion in India over the next five to seven years and nearly half of that amount went to Jio.  On April 22, global rival Facebook invested Rs 43,574 crore to pick up a 9.9 percent stake in Jio Platforms, sealing the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Indian tech sector. Nearly half of the famed FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) stocks of the US market have now bet on the RIL subsidiary.  Funding blitzkrieg In less than four months, Jio Platforms has attracted a staggering Rs 152,056 crore from a total of 13 investors by shedding around 33 percent stake. These investors include Silver Lake, Vista, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton, PIF, Intel and Qualcomm.  Consequently, Jio Platforms now commands an eye-popping equity valuation of Rs 4.36 lakh crore based on the latest bet by Google, reflecting its standing as a digital powerhouse, and not just a telecom player.  &ldquo;Look at the valuation and the sheer quality of names &mdash; leading strategic investors, blue-chip private equity funds and sovereign wealth funds. What else can one ask for? Some of the investors may look to exit post listing. Going forward, timing the IPO based on market conditions will be crucial,&rdquo; said a capital market deals advisor on condition of anonymity.  In the past, RIL has indicated plans to list Jio Platforms in the next few years.  The oil-to-telecom conglomerate has raised a combined Rs 212,809 crore through its record Rs 53,000 crore rights Issue, investments in Jio Platforms, and Rs 7,269 crore from an investment by British Petroleum in its fuel retail joint venture. The feat has no parallel in Indian corporate history.  Rs 212, 809 crore! Let that figure sink in. It&rsquo;s more than one percent of India&rsquo;s GDP and it was raised by RIL during the coronavirus pandemic, the most disruptive even in modern human history.  The figure far exceeds the net debt of the diversified conglomerate, which stood at Rs 1,61,035 crore at the end of March 31.  The gap would have been wider if unforeseen circumstances in the energy market had not delayed the progress of the Saudi Aramco deal. In August 2019, RIL announced plans to sell a 20 percent stake in its flagship chemicals and refining business to Saudi Aramco in a deal valued at $15 billion. But for now, the biggest takeaway for shareholders is that RIL is truly a zero net debt company, well ahead of Ambani&rsquo;s initial target of March 2021.  &ldquo;Our target for capital raise is now complete and we now look forward to only adding strategic partners who share our vision in each of our current and future businesses,&rdquo; Ambani said during his AGM speech.  Follow all of our coverage on&nbsp;RIL's 43rd annual general meeting here.  One milestone after another Recently, RIL crossed another milestone and became the first domestic firm to cross the Rs 12 lakh crore market capitalisation mark. From the lows of March, the share price has surged more than 100 percent.  According to a report by CNBCTV-18, it is the best performing mega-cap stock and ranks among the only non-American company in the top five best-performing stocks globally.  Market analysts have highlighted the promoter&rsquo;s investor centric approach and commitment to the debt reduction exercise in a challenging market.  &ldquo;RIL saw an opportunity in adversity during the lockdown period. Despite the Aramco deal getting delayed, due to the excellent infrastructure of Jio and the firm&rsquo;s execution capabilities, it managed to raise more than Rs 1,52,000 crore. The record rights issue was an additional cushion and the deferred payment facility and the willingness of the promoters to subscribe to the entire issue before its closure gave confidence to investors,&rdquo;&nbsp;said market expert SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com.

The partnership could be a game-changer not just for Jio and Google but for consumers&nbsp;as well.  Affordable 5G Android smartphones Ambani revealed that the company has already sold more than 100 million Jio Phones in a short period. However, more than 350 million feature phone users remain in the country and to bring them on board, it will bring in an entry-level 4G or even 5G smartphone at a fraction of its current cost.  The telecom giant is partnering with Google to make&nbsp;Android's feature set&nbsp;accessible to these millions of feature phone users by launching affordable smartphones. The partnership is mainly focused on jointly develop an affordable smartphone with optimisations to the Android operating system.  India is the world&rsquo;s second-largest market for smartphone users. While more than 550 million people have access to the internet, a large majority remain disconnected from the virtual world. The partnership with Jio will also help Google achieve its vision of providing access to people coupled with its Next Billion Users initiative.  Gateway to services and the Jio ecosystem of apps Ambani aims at making India 2G-mukt with the Jio-Google partnership. By offering affordable 4G and 5G smartphones running on Android, the partnership will not only give millions of people access to the world of internet but also open doors to a host of new services.  For example, Google&rsquo;s own family of apps, which includes the likes of Gmail, Maps, Duo, etc, will help people connect virtually and make life more convenient.&nbsp; Moreover, the company announced&nbsp;new services at the RIL 43rd AGM like the JioTV+.

However, with the company&nbsp;further committing to bringing in 5G networks, the next-generation network is likely to be available sooner with data speeds a lot faster than the current 4G standards.  The Made-in-India 5G technology can be deployed and launched in a year once spectrum is available, said the RIL chairman on July 15. Moreover, Jio can easily upgrade its 4G network to 5G because it is an all-IP network architecture, further saving on hardware, time and costs.

All of us are participating in it through&nbsp; our brand-new&nbsp; digital&nbsp; product &ndash; called&nbsp; JIOMEET. JIOMEET, since its release a few days ago has already been downloaded by more than 5 million users. It is India's first and only cloud-based video-conferencing app.  And you will be proud to know that it has been built by a young Jio Platforms team in just two months.  1.&nbsp; Business &amp;amp;amp; Financial Performance  Dear Friends, The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2020 have already been circulated to you. With your permission, I would like to take them as read.  Reliance had yet another year&nbsp; of record performance. Reliance became the first Indian company to exceed market capitalisation of $150 billion. Reliance is also the first Indian company to cross ₹ 1,00,000 crore in consolidated EBITDA.  The earnings from our O2C and Upstream businesses declined due to the challenging market environment.  Yet, the consolidated performance was up 10% over the last year due to strong growth in Organized Retail and Digital Services businesses.  Our consumer businesses continued to deliver hyper growth with an EBITDA growth of 49% this year. Consumer businesses&nbsp; today contribute&nbsp;&nbsp; about 35% of our consolidated EBITDA. Just five years ago, nearly all of our EBITDA was from our energy and materials business.  Since then, our consumer and technology businesses have rapidly achieved scale by their exponential growth.  Dear Shareholders,   Reliance's seminal contribution to the Indian economy remains unmatched. Here are a few snapshots:  At ₹ 202,830 crore, we continue to be India's largest exporter accounting for 9.1% of India's total merchandise exports across 109 countries.  We are India's highest payer of customs and excise duty in the private sector with payments of over ₹ 21,660 crore. We are amongst the highest payers of GST and VAT at ₹ 69,372 crore.  We are amongst the highest payers of Income Tax in the private sector paying ₹ 8,386 crore.  Dear Shareowners,  In last year's AGM speech, I had shared my goals of growing our businesses through partnerships and achieving a Net Debt Free Balance Sheet.  I am happy to report that we have fulfilled this promise well ahead of the timelines that we had set ourselves.  In a short span of a few months, we have raised a record amount of capital and forged several new strategic partnerships.  We&nbsp; completed&nbsp; India's largest-ever&nbsp; ₹ 53,124 crore Rights Issue. This was also the world's largest Rights Issue by a non-financial institution in a decade. This was over-subscribed 1.59 times, setting another record in the Indian capital markets.  A unique feature of RIL's Rights Issue was that it was completed entirely on a digital platform during the lockdown period.  None of the stakeholders - regulators, bankers, financial institutions, retail investors and others - had to step out of their offices or homes for it.  This showcased India's potential to be a pioneer and an innovator in this Digital Age.  Dear Shareholders - Thank you for making the Rights Issue a phenomenal success.  Dear Friends,   Let me take a few minutes to warmly welcome our new and esteemed partners in Jio.  First, Facebook, a global technology powerhouse and a leading social media and internet company as our premier strategic partner.  After Facebook, we have investments from some of the most admired technology and financial investors - Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, TPG and L Catterton.  All of them have a long history of successfully investing in the best of technology and growth enterprises in the world. Intel and Qualcomm, who have shaped the semi-conductor industry, are at the heart of the digital ecosystems.  We will work with them to develop new products for India and Indians.  I look forward to working with each of them in a collaborative way to build on Jio Platforms' portfolio of technology and solutions.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome three of the world's largest Sovereign Wealth Funds &ndash; ADIA and Mubadala of the UAE, and PIF of Saudi Arabia &ndash; as our valued partners.  We are grateful to all our partners. What they bring is more than money. They bring faith in the Indian economy's immense growth potential.  They also bring a strong vote of confidence in our bold mission, and our ability to execute it. We look forward to working with all of them and generating value to all our stakeholders.  Dear&nbsp; Friends,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As we end our current cycle of capital raising, we are delighted to welcome another strategic partner into Jio. A company that needs no introduction, because it is a household name in India and globally.  A company that has pioneered search engine and operating systems that are used across the world.  Let&nbsp; me&nbsp; welcome,&nbsp;Google&nbsp;to&nbsp; be&nbsp; our&nbsp; strategic&nbsp; investor in Jio Platforms. Today, we have signed a binding partnership and an investment agreement with GOOGLE&hellip; under which Google will invest ₹ 33,737 crores for a 7.7% stake in Jio Platforms.  This transaction is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.  With this investment by Google, strategic and financial investors have committed a total of ₹ 152,056 crore in the last few months.  We have also concluded our JV with BP in our existing fuel retailing business. BP has invested ₹ 7,629 crore for their 49% stake in the JV.  Cumulatively, we have raised a total of ₹ 212,809 crore through our Rights Issue, the combined investments in Jio Platforms, and investment by BP.  This is unprecedented in the history of capital markets in India. Indeed, there would be very few parallels globally.  This capital raise is significantly in excess of our Net Debt of ₹ 161,035 crore at the end of FY19-20. Reliance is now truly a zero Net Debt company, well ahead of my goal of March 2021.  We now have an extremely strong Balance Sheet that will support all our growth plans for our three Hyper-Growth Engines &ndash; Jio, Retail and O2C.  Our target for capital raise is now complete and we now look forward to only adding strategic partners who share our vision in each of our current and future businesses.  2.&nbsp;Jio/ Digital Services  Dear Friends,  Let&nbsp; me&nbsp; start&nbsp; with&nbsp; our&nbsp; first&nbsp; Hyper-Growth&nbsp; Engine&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp; JIO&hellip;&nbsp; our&nbsp; digital&nbsp; service&nbsp; initiative.&nbsp; I would like to first share with you the philosophy that animates Jio's current and future initiatives. The Digital Revolution marks the greatest disruptive transformation in the history of mankind.  Comparable only to the appearance of human beings with intelligence capabilities on our planet about 50,000 years ago.  It is comparable because man is now beginning to infuse almost limitless intelligence into the world around him. We are today at the initial stages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the evolution of an INTELLIGENT PLANET. Unlike in the past, this evolution will proceed with a revolutionary speed.  Our world will change more unrecognizably in just the eight remaining decades of the 21st century than today's world has changed from what it was 20 centuries ago.  For the first time in history, mankind has an opportunity to solve big problems inherited from the past. This will create a world of prosperity, beauty and happiness for all.  India must lead this change to create a better world.  For this, all our people and all our enterprises have to be enabled and empowered with the necessary technology infrastructure and capabilities.  This is Jio's purpose.  This is Jio's ambition.  Friends,  JIO is now the undisputed leader in India&hellip; With&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; largest&nbsp;&nbsp; customer&nbsp;&nbsp; base&hellip; the largest share of data and voice traffic&hellip;  and a world-class next-generation broadband network that covers the length and breadth of our country. As always&hellip;  We&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deeply&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thankful&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appreciative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customers&hellip;&nbsp; for their trust&hellip; and for giving us the privilege to serve and delight them every single day. This year&hellip; 2020&hellip; will forever be etched in human consciousness because of COVID-19&hellip;  Almost overnight&hellip; all of us became reliant on DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY&hellip; to stay connected&hellip; to stay healthy&hellip; and to stay productive.  I can say with pride, that during these past months&hellip; JIO has become the digital lifeline for Indians. Despite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; huge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traffic,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JIO's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; network&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; held&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firm&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and we continue to deliver on our promise of being an essential service provider to the nation.  Friends,  Jio's vision stands on two solid pillars. One is Digital Connectivity.  The other is Digital Platforms. We have now fully kickstarted all the FIVE ACCELERATORS of growth of DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY. ONE&hellip;  Mobile broadband.  TWO&hellip;  JIOFIBER&hellip; our optical-fiber based, Gigabit-speed HOME BROADBAND service. We have already connected over a million homes on JIOFIBER&hellip;  And our growth will accelerate as we gear up to connect millions more over the coming months in the post-COVID period.  THREE&hellip;  JIO's ENTERPRISE BROADBAND service&hellip;  In combination with powerful cloud solutions, this is enabling Indian enterprises to make rapid strides towards digital transformation&hellip; and global competitiveness.  FOUR&hellip;  BROADBAND for SMALLAND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES&hellip;  Jio's enterprise-grade voice and data services&hellip; and cloud-based solutions&hellip; are bringing Indian SMEs from zero connectivity and zero technology&hellip; to operating with the same efficiency as large connected enterprises.  And FIVE&hellip;  Jio's Narrowband Internet-of-Things &ndash; or NBIoT &ndash; service&hellip;  We use our pan-India 4G network to connect billions of smart sensors&hellip; with the highest reliability and lowest cost.  Friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In the next THREE years, I can see a strong path for Jio to connect Over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HALF A BILLION mobile customers; Over a BILLION smart sensors; and&nbsp; Over 50 million HOMES and BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS.  But, what is perhaps not so well known is that JIO's global-scale 4G and FIBER network is powered by several core software technologies and components&hellip;  that have been developed by young Jio engineers, right here in India.  And this capability and know-how that JIO has developed, positions JIO on the cutting edge of another exciting frontier&nbsp;&ndash; 5G.  TODAY,&nbsp;Friends,&nbsp;I have great pride in announcing&hellip; That JIO has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch.  This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India&hellip; using 100% home grown technologies and solutions.  This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available&hellip; and can be ready for field deployment next year.  And because of JIO's converged, all-IP network architecture&hellip; we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G.  Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio Platforms would be well positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally, as a complete managed service.  I dedicate Jio's 5G solution to our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's highly motivating vision of &lsquo;ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT&rsquo;.  Friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   JIO PLATFORMS is conceived with this vision&hellip; of developing original, captive INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY&hellip; using which we can demonstrate the transformative power of technology across multiple Industry ecosystems &hellip; First in India&hellip;  And then confidently offering these Made-in-India solutions to the rest of the world.  Applications like MyJio and Jio SAAVN have already become household names and are used by hundreds of millions of loyal customers each month.  JIO PLATFORMS, along with its over 20 start-up partners who are now part of our family, has built significant world- class capabilities in several cutting-edge technologies&hellip;  ONE&hellip; 4G and 5G technologies TWO&hellip; Cloud Computing  THREE&hellip; Devices and Operating Systems FOUR&hellip; Big Data Analytics  FIVE&hellip; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence SIX&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reality SEVEN&hellip; Block Chain  EIGHT&hellip; Natural Language Understanding NINE&hellip; Computer Vision&hellip;  Using these technologies, we can create compelling solutions that span multiple Industry verticals and ecosystems&hellip; like Media&hellip;  Financial&nbsp;&nbsp; Services&hellip; New Commerce&hellip; Education&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthcare&hellip; Agriculture&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cities&hellip; Smart Manufacturing&hellip;and Smart Mobility.  These are the technologies and ecosystem solutions that hold the power to achieve 360-degree digital transformation of India.  Our start-up partners have contributed significantly to our strengths across many of these areas&hellip; And we are inviting even more start-ups to join forces with us.  Friends,  With its 100% owned Intellectual Property&hellip; total solutions approach&hellip; and the opportunity to serve a global audience&hellip;  Over the years, Reliance has built deep domain knowledge in most of the Industry verticals that are key to the Indian economy&hellip;  and JIO PLATFORMS can combine this domain expertise with its technology strengths to create multiple innovative ecosystem solutions and managed services for our country.  Each of these solutions, once proven in India, has the potential to be a global solution&hellip; that can be used to serve the rest of the world.  I am setting a goal for JIO PLATFORMS to pursue this global opportunity and to create a significant source of revenue from both the domestic and global markets.  I believe that the time has come for a truly global digital product and services company to emerge from India, and to be counted among the best in the world.  Friends....  At this point, let me pause&hellip;  and invite Isha, Akash and Kiran on to our virtual stage&hellip; to demonstrate a few of the magical solutions that JIO has been working on recently&hellip;  DEMO FOLLOWS&hellip;  Thank you&nbsp; Isha, Akash and Kiran&hellip; for that sampling of the exciting solutions that Jio is developing.  Friends,  Given Jio's ambitions to be a global technology, platforms and solutions company,&nbsp; It is important that we keep the company of the best technology enterprises in the world. Last year, we announced our partnership with MICROSOFT&hellip;  And I am happy to report that we are making rapid progress in our Azure cloud partnership.  As I mentioned to you earlier, we are privileged to enter into another strategic partnership with FACEBOOK, one of the very best technology companies in the world.  We had announced our partnership in April of this year, and we have now received all the necessary regulatory approvals.  Both Facebook and Jio share a strong vision for digitally empowering consumers as well as small businesses and entrepreneurs across India.  And now&hellip; I want to share with all of you&hellip; a message from the CEO of FACEBOOK &ndash; MARK ZUCKERBERG. Which he made at the time of the announcement of our partnership.  Transcript of Mark Zuckerberg  &ldquo;Hi everyone. I know there's a lot going on around the world right now, and I hope you are all staying healthy and safe. I want to share an important update. Facebook is joining forces with a new partner in India &ndash; we're making a major financial investment, and we will become the largest minority shareholder in Jio Platforms. More than that, we're also committing to work together on some critical projects that we think will open up a lot of opportunities for commerce in India.  India is a special place for us, it's home to the largest communities around the world on Facebook and WhatsApp, and there are a lot of talented entrepreneurs. It is also in the middle of a major digital transformation that's being led by organizations like Jio that over the last four years have put hundreds of millions of Indians on to the internet. And that's a big deal, because when people get access to the internet, digital tools, they are powered to do a whole lot of new things  &ndash; learning, teaching, finding communities, people they care about, and of course starting all kinds of new businesses.  This is really important especially right now, because small businesses are at the core of every country's economy, and they need our support. India has more than 60 million small businesses and millions of people rely on them for their jobs and livelihoods. Lot of entrepreneurs now need tools they can rely on to help them find and communicate with their customers and to grow their businesses. Now, with a lot of communities around the world in lockdown, it's even more important now than ever that people have the tools to connect with each other, and their businesses can find ways to operate online. This is something that we think we can help with, which is why we are proud to be partnering with Jio to help people and businesses in India create a lot of new opportunities. We are going to share more on this soon.  So I want to thank Mukesh Ambani and the entire Jio team for your partnership. I think we are going to build a lot of great things that people find valuable in their daily lives, and importantly that make it easier to live and easier to do business. This is an important moment for all of us, and I want to personally extend a welcome to all others who want to get involved and help in this effort. We're looking forward to getting started. So, thank you and I hope you all continue staying healthy and safe.&rdquo;  Thank you, MARK.  WhatsApp&hellip; which is a FACEBOOK product&hellip; is already the platform of choice for Indians and Indian businesses to connect with each other.  Over 400 million WhatsApp users in India bring unique value to our partnership.  Jio's New Commerce platform&hellip; JioMart&hellip; and Whatsapp will be working closely to create growth opportunities for millions of Indian small merchants and kirana shops&hellip;  And to ensure that consumers are able to transact seamlessly with nearby kiranas using JioMart and WhatsApp.  Friends,&nbsp;  Let me now talk about our partnership with Google.  From day one&hellip; it has been Jio's commitment to provide affordable 4G devices to more than 450 million feature phone users in India.  It was with this intention&hellip; that a couple of years back&hellip; we developed the JIOPHONE&hellip; which still remains the world's most affordable 4G phone.  Now&hellip; even though we have sold over 100 million JIOPHONES till date&hellip;  there are many featurephone users who are waiting&hellip; to upgrade to a conventional SMARTPHONE&hellip; if only it were somehow more affordable.  So, we have decided to address this challenge head-on.  We believe we can design entry-level 4G&hellip; or even 5G SMARTPHONE&hellip; for a fraction of its current cost.  But, to power such a value engineered smartphone, we also need an equally value-engineered smartphone operating system...and such an operating system must be designed with India in mind.  Google and Jio are partnering to build an Android-based smartphone operating system.  Through this partnership, we are confident that we can accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian.  As India is standing at the doorsteps of the 5G era, we should accelerate the migration of 350 million Indians, who currently use a 2G feature phone, to an affordable smart phone.  They should not be deprived of the benefits of the digital and data revolution. Jio is determined to make India 2G-mukt.  On this occasion&hellip; we have with us a special guest to talk about this partnership&hellip;  &hellip; the CEO of GOOGLE And a proud Indian icon&hellip;  &ndash; SUNDAR PICHAI.  Transcript of Sundar Pichai Video:  &ldquo;Thanks, Mukesh, and to the entire team at Reliance Industries, for all the work you do to give millions of Indians the power to shape their destiny through technology. And thank you for the opportunity to share a few words about what our new partnership means to Google.  Getting technology into the hands of more people is a big part of Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Through this partnership with Jio Platforms we see the chance to have an even greater impact than either company could have alone.  This partnership is a key part of the next chapter of investment in India. Earlier this week we announced our Google for India Digitization Fund, an effort to invest 75,000 crore rupees or approximately $10 billion -- to accelerate India's digital economy over the next 5 to 7 years.  Our investment of $4.5 billion in Jio is the first -- and the biggest -- investment we will make through this fund. I am excited that our joint collaboration will focus on increasing access for hundreds of millions of Indians who don't currently own a smartphone...while improving the mobile experience for all.  Growing up I remember how the arrival of each new technology improved the lives of my family. Today, people in India no longer have to wait for technology to come to you. A whole new generation of technologies are happening here, first. At the same time, smartphones and affordable data have made it possible for a billion Indians to come online. Reliance, and Jio in particular, deserves a good deal of credit for this progress.  But there is more work to do to connect every Indian to the opportunities that technology creates.This goal is especially important at a time of enormous challenge for India and the world. I've never been more hopeful about India's future -- it's a future we can help shape by partnering together.  Thank you for having me. I wish you strength and good health in the months to come.&rdquo;  Thank you, Sundar, for your wonderful words.  We&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; truly&nbsp;&nbsp; blessed&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; world-class&nbsp;&nbsp; partners&nbsp;&nbsp; like&nbsp;&nbsp; Facebook,&nbsp;&nbsp; Google&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their company, we are even more confident of reaching the ambitious goals that we have currently identified.  And in a large market like India, I am sure we will find even more areas where we can work together.  Friends,&nbsp;  Our journey thus far&hellip; and our road ahead&hellip; is possible&hellip; most of all&hellip; because of the talented and passionate people who are part of the Jio Family.  And in this family, we count our employees, our strategic partners, our technology partners, our channel partners&hellip; and the many start-ups who have partnered with us.  Just&nbsp; a&nbsp; few&nbsp; decades&nbsp; back,&nbsp; Reliance&nbsp;&nbsp; itself&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; start-up&hellip; And as a less-than 4 years old company, JIO is still very much a start-up.  As such&hellip; we have a very special place in our heart for start-ups&hellip; whom we consider our brothers-in-arms. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; believe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start-ups&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JIO.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are well positioned to help Indian start-ups in a number of ways&hellip;  Whether it be in technology development&hellip; product development&hellip; distribution&hellip; market access&hellip; or even scale-up capital&hellip;  We are ready to integrate them into our roadmap and to help them reach their full potential.  We believe that this would be the true measure of success for Jio&hellip; to create a mighty Knowledge Coalition that solves Indian problems&hellip;  and opens the doors for many more companies from India to step successfully on to the global stage.  Friends,&nbsp;  Together, I am confident that Jio, and this extended Jio Family&hellip; will play a leading role in India's transformation into a DIGITAL SOCIETY&hellip; and one of the leading digitally-enabled economies in the world.  Let me now present the success of our media and entertainment.  Our Network18 Group's 72 channel-strong TV broadcast network across News and Entertainment reaches more than 800 million Indians.  Our digital properties are now used by almost 200 million people every month. We are amongst the top 10 digital news players across sectors.  We&nbsp; are consolidating our media and distribution businesses. Den and Hathway are being merged with Network18 and TV18, subject to regulatory approvals. This will make the Network18 group the largest listed media and distribution company in the country.  	Organised Retail  Dear Shareholders,  Reliance Retail has been at the forefront of bringing about the Organized Retail Revolution in India.  At the heart of our business is our relentless commitment to serve customers at scale to meet their everyday needs by providing extreme value and convenience.  We do this by partnering with farmers, small and medium-scale manufacturers, merchants, vendors, start-ups and global companies.  Last year, Reliance Retail revenues were ₹ 162,936 crore and EBITDA was ₹ 9,654 crore. We are India's largest and most profitable retail business.  Reliance Retail is the fastest growing retailer in the world, and the only Indian Retailer to feature in the Top 100 global retailers.  And we continue to be a partner of choice for marquee international brands.  I applaud the Retail team for ensuring the supply of essentials to our consumers, despite enormous constraints during the lockdown.  Dear Shareowners,   In the last five years, our revenues in the retail business have grown 8 times and our profits 11 times. This positions us well in the years ahead to continue delivering on our promise of exponential growth. Four things that give me huge satisfaction are:  First, more than two-thirds of our nearly 12,000 stores are operated in Tier II, Tier III and Tier IV towns.  Second, the deep-rooted bond with tens of thousands of farmers that has helped us source over 80% of our fresh fruits and vegetable directly from farmers.  We&nbsp;&nbsp; sell&nbsp;&nbsp; more&nbsp;&nbsp; fruits&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; vegetables&nbsp;&nbsp; than&nbsp;&nbsp; any&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organised&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retailer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country. Third, we continue to provide large employment and development opportunities for lakhs of people across India. Fourth, our growth model is based on partnership with small merchants and shopkeepers.  Dear Shareowners,  Last year, I spoke about our New Commerce initiative, JioMart.  JioMart is a tech-enabled partnership that will link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands and consumers.  And will reduce inefficiencies thereby creating more value for everyone in the retail ecosystem. Connecting farmers and delivering their fresh produce directly to homes is a key part of our grocery strategy. This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; significantly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; improve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farmer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; income&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incentivise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; higher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; productivity New Commerce will transfer significant new value to consumers, producers and merchants.  I am happy&nbsp; to&nbsp; report that we&nbsp; are&nbsp; accelerating the rollout of JioMart. Currently, we have successfully piloted our JioMart grocery model&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kirana partners. We are also piloting&nbsp; the&nbsp; beta&nbsp; version&nbsp; of the JioMart&nbsp; grocery&nbsp; customer&nbsp; online&nbsp; platform&nbsp; in&nbsp; 200&nbsp; cities. Within a few weeks of launch, we have reached over 250,000 orders a day and the numbers continue to grow each day. JioMart is now focused on scaling its geographical reach and delivery capabilities.  JioMart is obsessed with providing convenience and a superior shopping experience to consumers.  In addition to grocery, we will expand JioMart to cover electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare in the days ahead.  In the coming years, we will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand to many more categories.  Dear Shareowners,  Today&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognizes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hyper-growth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inclusive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model. We have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail. We will induct global partners and investors in Reliance Retail in the next few quarters.  I will keep you informed about the progress of Reliance Retail, which is at the doorsteps of continued exponential growth.  4. Oil to Chemicals And Oil and Gas  Dear Shareowners,   Now I will present our plans to transform our energy and materials businesses into a new growth engine. The year gone by, was the most challenging for global refining and petrochemical industries.  Even in this uncertain and volatile environment, our O2C business outperformed the sector and delivered an EBITDA of ₹ 55,394 crore.  Globally this year, business and consumer activity had come to a halt leading to unprecedented demand destruction and dislocation of margins.  Despite that, I am glad to report that all our manufacturing facilities continued to operate at over 90% capacity utilisation.  During India's lock-down, we leveraged our deep understanding of global markets and successfully enhanced our petrochemical and fuel exports by over 2.5 times in just two weeks.  I am proud to share with you that in April 2020, our O2C business accounted for nearly 50% of India's exports. I applaud the entire O2C Business and Manufacturing Teams for their agility and focus.  We have commissioned India's first Butyl Rubber plant, which places us amongst the world's top ten producers of Butyl Rubber.  Our O2C business has competitive feedstock streams that are the building blocks for specialty and new value chains of Acetyls, Acrylates, Phenols and Polyurethanes.  Reliance has been approached by global companies for strategic partnerships in its petrochemical business, including in utilizing these feedstocks.  These potential partnerships will help us build competitive manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to serve the deficit Indian market that still depends on large-scale imports of chemicals.  With this we will have an integrated and competitive Oil to Chemicals portfolio which is valuable to global companies as it provides access to the large and growing Indian market.  Last year, I shared with you the basis of equity investment by Saudi Aramco in our O2C business.  Due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the Covid-19 situation, the deal has not progressed as per the original timeline.  Our equity requirements have already been met.  Nevertheless, we at Reliance value our over two-decade long relationship with Saudi Aramco and are committed to a long-term partnership.  We will approach NCLT with our proposal to spin off our O2C business into a separate subsidiary to facilitate this partnership opportunity.  We expect to complete this process by early 2021.  Dear Friends,   BP is our valued partner in the Upstream Energy Business.  We expect to restart the KG-D6 towards the end of the year and provide India with Natural Gas, which is one of the cleanest fossil fuels.  We have further strengthened our relationship with BP, who have invested into our existing Fuel Retailing business under a new brand of Jio-bp.  Based on our combined strengths, Jio-bp will provide new age mobility solutions to Indian consumers.  Dear Friends,&nbsp;  Let me now share with you Reliance's long-term vision, beyond O2C and how we are re-imagining our entire energy platform.  Our guiding purpose is prosperity for all people and prosperity for our planet, before prosperity for energy companies.  The catastrophic impact of Climate Change calls for the legacy energy industry to reinvent itself on a war footing.  Furthermore, the world needs access to clean and affordable energy and this must be met, as it is a pre-requisite to ensuring quality of life for all people.  To meet these twin challenges, the energy industry must understand that fossil fuels and renewables are not mutually exclusive or contradictory.  The first three Industrial Revolutions based on fossil fuels disturbed the natural Carbon Cycle on Planet Earth. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has the opportunity to repair and restore the Carbon Cycle.  Here, Mother Nature is our best teacher. She wastes nothing and recycles everything.  So it is imperative that the energy industry adopts a clean, circular, sustainable and planet-friendly model that delivers green and affordable energy to all the 7.8 billion people on the planet.  This is what will drive our progress towards a cleaner planet for a safer humanity. This can be achieved by making CO2as a recyclable resource, rather than treating it as an emitted waste.  While Reliance will remain a user of crude oil and natural gas, we are committed to embracing new technologies to  convert our CO2&nbsp;into useful products and chemicals.  We have already made substantial progress on photosynthetic biological pathways to convert our CO2&nbsp; emissions at Jamnagar into high value proteins, nutraceuticals, advanced materials and fuels.  We will develop next-gen carbon capture and storage technologies. We are evaluating novel catalytic and electrochemical transformations to use CO2&nbsp;as a valuable feedstock. Reliance also has proprietary technology to convert transportation fuels to valuable petrochemical and material&nbsp;building&nbsp;blocks. And at the same time, we will replace transportation fuels with clean electricity and hydrogen. We will combine our strengths in digital, power electronics, advanced materials and electrochemistry to build full stack electrolyser and fuel cell solutions in India.  We will build an optimal mix of reliable, clean and affordable energy with hydrogen, wind, solar, fuel cells and battery.  Transforming our energy business to tackle one of the biggest challenges before India and the World is our new growth opportunity.  On successful implementation of this strategy, we target to become net carbon-zero by 2035.  We have a 15-year vision to build Reliance as one of the world's leading NEW ENERGY and NEW MATERIALS COMPANY.  It will be a platform company which will execute our vision in a worldwide collaborative model.  This model envisages a large coalition of global financial investors, reputed technology partners, and start-ups working on futuristic solutions.  The New Energy business based on the principle of Carbon Recycle and Circular Economy is a multi-trillion opportunity for India and the world.  It is also an opportunity to make clean and green energy abundantly available at an affordable price to every Indian, every Indian enterprise and every Indian utility.  More than a business, this is our seva to save Planet Earth from the ravages of Climate Change. We shall spare no effort in realising this dream.  From time to time, I shall apprise you of our progress in this business  5. Reliance Foundation and Reliance Family's Crusade Against Covid-19  Dear&nbsp; &nbsp;Friends, Let me now welcome Nita to talk about Reliance Foundation. Thank you, Mukesh.  Esteemed shareholders,  Namaskar.  As I speak to you for the first time ever in a Reliance AGM, I feel a profound sense of humility and gratitude.&nbsp; All of us have witnessed the unprecedented pain, uncertainty, and suffering that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing.  That is why, Mukesh and I decided that we should do all that we can, in performing our humanitarian, patriotic, and collective duty in this hour of national need.  It is my privilege to share with you some of the work that the Reliance Family has done in the past four months &ndash; and continues to do so, each day and every hour:  First: Within days of the Coronavirus outbreak, we set up India's first 100-bed exclusive COVID-19 Hospital in Mumbai, in just two weeks.  Today, this facility has 250 beds.  Our brave-heart doctors and nurses have been working selflessly and tirelessly in service of our fellow Indians.  In your work, humanity has placed their hope and faith.  With folded hands, I express my deep gratitude to all healthcare workers who have dedicated themselves to fighting this battle!  I would like to share with you a few glimpses of the exemplary efforts of our front-line warriors&hellip; When the pandemic broke out, one of the earliest challenges was the shortage of PPEs.  It was critical to protect our healthcare workers and provide them with the right armour so that they could fight valiantly at the forefront!  In record time, we turned around our manufacturing facility to produce over 1 lakh PPEs and N95 masks every single day.  And that too at one third the price of imported PPEs, as we remain committed to the &ldquo;Make In India&rdquo; mission.  That's not all. Every business in the Reliance Family has done their bit and contributed to India's fight against COVID-19.  The team at Reliance Retail is working overtime to provide essential supplies daily to millions of Indian families across 200 cities.  Jio is providing digital connectivity to over 40 crore individuals, empowering over 30,000 organizations to work from home&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; and lacs of students to learn from home.  Reliance has also been providing free fuel to Emergency Service vehicles across the country.  This is not just business for us.  It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; duty,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dharma,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seva&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nation. That brings me to another form of Seva, which is closest to my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliance Foundation's Mission Anna Seva &ndash; our pledge to feed needy Indians. In our culture, Anna Daan is Maha Daan.  Through Mission Anna Seva, we have provided more than 5 crore meals to marginalised communities, daily-wage earners, and frontline workers across the country.  We are humbled that our Mission Anna Seva has become the largest meal distribution programme undertaken by a corporate foundation anywhere in the world.  This would not have been possible without the untiring efforts and dedication of the entire team of Reliance Foundation, and all our volunteers and partner organizations.  We are also grateful to our two lakh employees of Reliance who have gone beyond their call of duty, to serve our fellow citizens.  This has been a deeply fulfilling journey for all of us.  Friends,&nbsp;  The war against coronavirus is far from over.  Reliance Foundation is gearing up to partner with the government and local municipalities, for mega-scale COVID testing across India, with the help of Jio's digital infrastructure.  And I assure you, as soon as the corona vaccine becomes available, we will volunteer by using the same digital distribution and supply chain, to ensure that the vaccine reaches every nook and corner of our country&hellip;&hellip;.  For Mukesh and me, being of service to our nation has given us a deep sense of satisfaction.  We are so proud of our Reliance Family's contribution to India's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and their efforts to help alleviate the suffering of our brothers and sisters.  Please join me in applauding and saluting&hellip;  All our doctors, nurses, medical personnel and staff of Sir H. N. Reliance Foundation Hospital and other Reliance Foundation hospitals;  All scientists and researchers at Reliance Life Sciences; All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation; And all our colleagues at Reliance Retail and Jio;&nbsp; You have made RELIANCE proud, INDIA proud.  Friends,  This year, Reliance Foundation is celebrating its 10th year of 'Transforming Lives' across India.  Over the last decade, our Foundation has touched the lives of over 36 million people, in the remotest corners of our country.  As the Foundation enters its next decade, my daughter Isha and her young team are determined to enhance our scale and impact &ndash; more than ten times.  Using Jio's digital power, we aim to make affordable healthcare and quality education accessible to every Indian. Along with education, sport forms the bedrock of any society, especially a young society like ours.  Children have a special place in my heart. When children learn and play, communities grow and countries prosper.  Through our Education and Sports for All initiative, Reliance Foundation has so far reached out to over 21.5 million children.  Right from grassroots level &ndash; we are working tirelessly to develop a holistic sporting ecosystem in the country. An ecosystem that will scout, nurture, train, and develop future champions!  It is my dream to see our athletes excel at the pinnacle of global sport &ndash; The Olympics. It is also my dream to bring the Olympics to India.  I believe in our youth. And I have no doubt that if we encourage and empower them, they will make these dreams come true and make our country proud. Dear Shareholders,  For all of us at Reliance, the work of Reliance Foundation is a source of tremendous joy, pride, and fulfilment.  For us, the ability to make a difference &ndash; big or small &ndash; to touch someone's life for the better, is more precious than anything else.  Whenever India has faced any adversity, we Indians have always overcome it with absolute unity and determination.  This crisis will be&nbsp; no&nbsp; different. Together, we can and we will win this fight. And come out stronger as a nation.  Keep well. Keep safe. Jai Hind!  Thank you, Nita for highlighting how Reliance Foundation is a caring and compassionate institution always ready to serve the nation.  	Value Creation and Conclusion  Dear Shareowners,  Let&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; share&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliance's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; future&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation Roadmap. Our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani gave us a mantra that continues to guide us in our value creation journey. He said &ldquo;GROWTH IS LIFE&rdquo;, which we have adopted as our motto.  He also constantly reminded us that, for happiness, growth should be holistic, enriching the life of every Indian and developing every aspect of human life.  Walking in his footsteps, Reliance has constantly reinvented itself to pursue ever higher growth goals.  And with each new growth cycle, we have demonstrated our commitment to create more prosperity for India and benefit more Indians.  In&nbsp;&nbsp; 2020,&nbsp;&nbsp; we&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp; can&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; proud&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stands&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stronger&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ever&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before. This is because, as a Technology and Consumer Company, Reliance has built three Hyper-Growth Engines&hellip; Jio Platforms business.  Reliance Retail's New Commerce business. Reliance's O2C business.  In the years to come, Reliance will create more growth engines for accelerating its diversified growth.  Among them, as I have already mentioned, is our vision to make Reliance a New Energy and New Materials Company.  Our&nbsp;&nbsp; growth&nbsp;&nbsp; strategy&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; aimed&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; needs&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; billion&nbsp;&nbsp; Indians. Especially, the millions of under-privileged people, who are at the Bottom of the Economic and Social Pyramid. So far, India's growth has been sustained by the demands of a small part of our enviable demographic strength. But when 'Bharat' and 'India' start growing together, the whole world will be astonished.  When we create value for our nation's inclusive future, its automatic by-product is value accretion for Reliance.  Dear Shareowners,  We are well aware that we cannot realise this vision on our own. Indeed, no single company can.  Therefore, we are adopting a strategy of two Ps &ndash;  Partnerships with millions of small merchants, kisans, SMEs, teachers, healthcare workers, helping them become more productive and profitable.  Also, Partnerships with promising Indian start-ups and globally renowned technology and energy companies. Intellectual property is going to be an important pillar of our value creation journey.  Therefore, Reliance will continue to strengthen its in-house capabilities in cutting-edge technological innovations. Towards this end, we will work more aggressively to attract the best young Indian talent.  Reliance will work with other Indian companies, including start-ups, to vigorously promote &ldquo;Made-in-India&rdquo;, &ldquo;Made-for-India&rdquo; and &ldquo;Made-for-the-World&rdquo; products.  Dear Shareholders,  As Reliance grows bigger, we have demonstrated our ability to raise necessary investments to fire our growth engines.  Now, on the back of our robust balance sheet, and taking advantage of the favourable conditions in global debt markets, we shall confidently pursue all future growth opportunities across our businesses.  Our track record of value creation so far will itself open future tracks of investment on a sustainable basis.  Dear Shareholders,   Reliance has travelled three years into its Golden Decade. What an incredible journey it has been since our IPO in 1977. Our market capitalization has increased at a CAGR of 31%.  Reliance is now ranked among the World's 60 largest companies by market capitalization.  And when Reliance scales still higher summits of success, our employees and shareholders will surely reap its rewards.  Dear Shareholders,  Reliance's 50th&nbsp;anniversary in 2027 coincides with the 80th&nbsp;anniversary of India's Independence. This is not a coincidence.  It shows the intrinsic relationship between New Reliance and New India.  Today I want to solemnly pledge that we are ever more committed to maximising our contribution to solving the big problems facing our Nation and also our Planet.  Dear Friends,  Before I conclude, I must share my deepest emotion with you.  These are difficult times, no doubt, for India and the world because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, never have I felt more optimistic in my life about a bright future for India, and for Reliance.  When I interact with young entrepreneurs, engineers and innovators, both in Reliance and in other enterprises, I clearly see in them a level of ambition and self-confidence far higher than in people of my generation.  They surely are going to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;Indian&nbsp; Dream&nbsp;&nbsp;come true. They strengthen my conviction that INDIA'S TIME HAS WELLAND TRULY COME!  Our visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has rightly predicted that, beyond the hardships of the corona crisis, India will emerge as a stronger, more inclusively prosperous, more resilient and more self-confident nation.  Let us work together to realise this noble goal.  For all of us at Reliance, the source of inspiration is Swami Vivekananda, who said: &ldquo;Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.&rdquo;  In this mission to serve India and the world, we seek the blessings of all of you dear shareowners, of our Elders, and Lord Krishna.  	Acknowledgements  I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, lenders, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.  I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their oversight in this crucial phase of our growth, their support and immense encouragement.  I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly to create and sustain a world-class enterprise.  Thank you!

Reliance Industries share price hit a fresh record high of Rs 1,978.50 on July 15, the day of 43rd Annual General Meeting. The stock gained 3.2 percent intraday and at 12:51 hours IST, it was quoting at Rs 1,956.05, up 2.06 percent on the BSE.  The stock has so far gained 128 percent from its March 23 low and remained the biggest gainer among Nifty50 stocks since then. It is the first company to cross Rs 12 lakh crore in market cap, thanks all to Jio and digital business.  &amp;quot;RIL's well-established connectivity business under Jio Platforms, formidable offline retail footprint under Reliance Retail, proposed foray in the digital commerce segment under JioMart and recent strategic partnership with Facebook, have propelled it to the forefront of consumer-facing digital ecosystem opportunity in India,&amp;quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities which retained buy rating on the stock, raising SoTP-based fair value to Rs 2,150 (from Rs 1,750 earlier).  Catch All Live Updates on Reliance's 43rd AGM Here  The brokerage believes RIL's ever-expanding portfolio of products and services to target the 4Cs of the digital ecosystem &mdash;connectivity, commerce, content and currency&mdash;will enable it to leverage the sizeable traffic across its consumer-facing verticals, generate new revenue streams and create significant value in the long run.  Reliance Industries has sold more than 25 percent stake in Jio Platforms since April 22, to global marquee investors. So far Facebook, the owner of Whatsapp, is the biggest shareholder in Jio Platforms after Reliance Industries, acquired 9.99 percent stake for Rs 43,574 crore.  Kotak valued the overall retail business at an enterprise value of $62 billion.  &amp;quot;(1) ascribing 25X EV/EBITDA multiple to core retail segment versus 20X earlier and (2) factoring incremental contribution of $17 billion (around Rs 1.3 lakh crore) from the digital commerce business based on probability-weighted scenarios that may evolve for e-commerce in India by FY30. (1) RIL's proven track record of execution, (2) large customer base of Jio and retail segments, (3) strategic tie-up with WhatsApp, (4) unmatched portfolio of private labels and exclusive brand tie-ups, (5) India&rsquo;s domestic-centric policies and (6) possible inorganic ventures, will enable the company to overcome the head-start achieved by other e-commerce players,&amp;quot; it reasoned.  Its analysis of the overall retail business opportunity suggests that Reliance Retail can potentially double its revenues to over $26 billion from core segments in next four years, while achieving an incremental gross merchandise value (GMV) of $12 billion from its foray in India's e-commerce market, which is all set to treble to $100 billion by FY25.  Kotak feels progress on digital commerce business, monetization of incremental ecosystem opportunities, increase in telecom tariffs and recovery in O2C business environment are the key catalysts to watch out for.  Potential closure of transactions related to O2C and fiber-InvIT, and further strategic partnerships in digital services and retail business can be positive triggers as well, according to the brokerage.

The collective wealth of India&rsquo;s billionaires, according to the Forbes World Billionaires 2020 List, contracted 22.8 percent to $312.6 billion from $405.3 billion a year earlier. Forbes calculated net worth based on stock prices and exchange rates as on March 18.  Reliance Industries&rsquo; (RIL) owner Mukesh Ambani continued to hold his position as India&rsquo;s richest, but saw his wealth fall by over 25 percent to $36.8 billion, from $50 billion last year due to stock market collapses and global oil fluctuations. (RIL is the owner of Network 18, publisher of Forbes India.)  However, Ambani has since stormed back into the top 10 of the&nbsp;Forbes real-time Billionaires Index (as of June 26), on the back of 11 large investments into its telecom subsidiary Jio Platforms, which has led to a surge in the RIL stock price and helped make it debt-free.  At least 15 billionaires from the list have seen a growth in net worth from last year. Radhakishan Damani jumped to become the second richest Indian billionaire from seventh in 2019 (net worth up by 24 percent to $13.8 billion), through his Avenue Supermarts which owns and operates the DMart chain of hypermarkets.  Other gainers include Sunil Mittal, whose net worth rose by 35 percent to $8.8 billion in the list, as its telecom service Bharti Airtel has emerged a force to reckon with. Industrialist Gautam Adani, who leads the diversified Adani Group, food and beverages tycoon Ravi Jaipuria and Shree Cement founder Benu Gopal Bangur also gained in net worth from the previous year.  Once math tutor and now entrepreneur Byju Raveendran (in picture) debuts on the list (53rd richest Indian and ranked 1,196) on the back of sharp growth of his edtech unicorn Byju&rsquo;s. According to the list, the company is valued at $8 billion and Raveendran, India&rsquo;s youngest billionaire at 38, at $1.8 billion. (In June-end, Byju&rsquo;s raised about $100 million from Silicon Valley investor Bond Capital, sending its valuation soaring at around $10.5 billion.)  The net worth of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, India&rsquo;s second richest billionaire as per the 2019 list, has fallen 73 percent to $6.1 billion and rank to tenth, as he has been giving away most of his wealth to his charity foundation.  The number of India&rsquo;s dollar billionaires in the list fell by four to 102, which included Ambani&rsquo;s younger brother Anil (75th Indian and 1,349 on the 2019 list). Anil Ambani has seen his businesses crumble, with RCom filing for bankruptcy last year. Media tycoon Subhash Chandra (51st Indian and 916 in 2019) has also fallen off due to debts.  For some, stock market fortunes and business cycles continue to be harsh. Former Yes Bank shareholders Rana Kapoor and Madhu Kapur; Tarang Jain, owner of auto-part maker Varroc, and Max Group&rsquo;s chairman Analjit Singh, who had dropped out in 2019, have not climbed back onto the list. The current fiscal is bound to throw up more unpleasant news.

At the last AGM on August 12, 2019, the firm's billionaire chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a roadmap for Reliance to become a net-debt free company before March 31, 2021.  &amp;quot;We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company within the next 18 months that is by March 31, 2021,&amp;quot; he had said, highlighting strong interest from strategic and financial investors in consumer businesses, Jio and Reliance Retail.  But the oil-to-telecom conglomerate achieved net-debt free status last week itself on the back of a record Rs 1.69 lakh crore fund raising from stake sales and rights issue.  Reliance secured over Rs 1.15 lakh crore from global tech investors including Facebook by selling a little less than a quarter of its digital business and raised Rs 53,124 crore by selling shares to existing investors in the past 58 days.  Taken together with last year's sale of 49 per cent stake in fuel retailing venture to BP Plc of UK for Rs 7,000 crore, the total fund raised is in excess of Rs 1.75 lakh crore, the company had said last week.  Reliance had a net debt of Rs 1,61,035 crore as on March 31, 2020. &amp;quot;With these investments, RIL has become net-debt free,&amp;quot; it had said.  At the last AGM, Ambani had also announced plans to sell a USD 15 billion stake in his group's oil-to-chemical business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co but the deal has got slightly delayed.  Not to be outdone by the delay, he lured partners to Jio Platforms Ltd, which houses India's biggest telecom firm by subscribers, Reliance Jio.  With more than 388 million users, Jio has forced out several rivals and driven consolidation in the sector since entering the market in 2016 with free voice services and cut-price data.  Sale of stake in Jio Platforms raised Rs 1,15,693.95 crore from leading global investors including Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton and PIF since April 22, 2020.

A committee of directors of the firm today approved a massive fund raising exercise of up to Rs 14,000 crore in one or more tranches through a combination of financial instruments.  Earlier this week, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported about the mega fundraising plans of the Deepak Parekh-led housing finance powerhouse. The report had said HDFC Ltd &nbsp;was looking to raise &nbsp;around Rs 12,000 crore in multiple tranches via a combination of a QIP and an NCD (non-convertible debenture ) + warrant or FCCB ( foreign currency convertible bond route) .  It had added that the firm wanted to boost its capital buffers due to the uncertainty caused post the outbreak of COVID-19 and potential concerns on asset quality.  The fundraising could be carried out in one or more tranches via issuance of equity shares or compulsorily convertible debentures, non-convertible debentures along with warrants, foreign currency convertible bonds either through a qualified institutional placement or other permissible modes, the company said in its official statement today.  The HDFC statement added that the said funds are being raised to augment its long term resources , finance organic &amp;amp;amp; inorganic business opportunities that may arise in financial services including housing finance and /or in areas where its subsidiaries operate, and to maintain sufficient liquidity and for general corporate purposes.  The company reported a standalone profit of Rs 2,232.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, declining 22 percent due to higher provisions related to COVID-19 and high base last year. Provisions (expected credit loss) increased significantly to Rs 1,274 crore for the quarter ended March 2020 which included the impact of COVID-19, against Rs 398 crore in March quarter 2019.  HDFC said it has made provisions of Rs 10,988 crore as of March 31. This is Rs 6,800 crore over and above the regulatory requirement.&nbsp;To be sure, HDFC Ltd has a capital adequacy of 17.7 percent (of which 16.6 percent is tier one capital), which is one of the highest in the financial sector in India.

Here is what PVR Ltd, the nation&rsquo;s largest operator of multi-screen theatres, has to say.  &ldquo;Since all cinemas are shut, the company is not generating any revenue from operations while we continue to incur committed cash outflows, including salary payouts, overheads as well as payments for older working capital,&rdquo; it said in a communication to the stock exchanges on June 8.  Aditya Birla Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Retail is another example. The company has seen a dramatic drop in footfalls at stores and plunging sales from the second week of March.  &ldquo;Eventually, it had to shut down its entire retail network through the month in line with the nationwide lockdown. This had an adverse impact on the quarterly performance,&rdquo; the company said on May 27.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Ajay Tyagi and team is aware of the woes of the smaller players and has taken several steps to help the companies.  Sebi has relaxed the fund-raising norms by amending the Takeover Code and the ICDR ( Issue of Capital &amp;amp;amp; Disclosure ) Regulations. The new rules were notified on June 16.  In the last few months, Sebi had already taken a few other steps like extending the approval validity for launching IPOs by six months, relaxing the norms for changing the size of fresh issues, widening the eligibility for companies to fast-track rights issues, slashing broker turnover fees and filing charges for issuers, and directing listed companies to disclose the impact of COVID-19 on their operations.  Subsequently, the Ajay Bijli-promoted PVR approved a Rs 300 crore-rights issue while bracing for a &ldquo;significant negative impact on profitability and liquidity during lockdown and even thereafter till business comes to normalcy.&rdquo; Aditya Birla Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Retail is also planning a rights issue.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    WILL THE TWEAKS TO THE TAKEOVER CODE ENTHUSE PROMOTERS?  The changes to the takeover code will now allow promoters to acquire up to 10 per cent in their firms (as compared to 5 per cent earlier, referred to as a creeping acquisition) in a financial year without an open offer.  Promoters, however, can do that only through a preferential issue of shares and after pumping in fresh capital.&nbsp;A preferential issue is a sale of shares by a firm to a select group of investors, and is considered one of the swiftest ways to raise capital.  The move is valid till March 31, 2021.  Sandip Bhagat, partner at law firm S&amp;amp;amp;R Associates, says it&rsquo;s a welcome move as it would offer promoters more flexibility and help listed companies to raise fresh funds from promoters in these tough times. This step is also a breather to companies which were finding it difficult to access debt financing and equity financing.  But the jury is out on whether the limited relaxation of an additional 5 per cent would be sufficient for companies.  &ldquo;The doubling of head room for creeping acquisition, solely for promoters and solely for the infusion of fresh money into the company seems like a nudge to enable money being invested into business instead of being spent on buying shares,&rdquo; says securities law expert and advocate Somasekhar Sundaresan.  In the current environment, businesses are looking at shareholders to tap fund-raising avenues and create adequate liquidity buffers.  &ldquo;Promoters with deep pockets could bring in funds and ensure cash flow in trying times like now. It&rsquo;s the first attempt at a fixed-term provision with a sunset clause just for this financial year. It would be interesting to see if it is put to use,&rdquo; Sundaresan adds.  Many corporates have warmed up to rights issues (issue of shares at a special price for existing shareholders) in recent months, which have seen promoters lapping up residual or renounced shares.  Even private equity firms are focusing more on the operations of their portfolio firms.  &ldquo;While rights issue was one avenue, one limitation for listed companies was the inability to raise capital from promoters in excess of 5 per cent in a financial year without a mandatory open offer for another 26 per cent.&nbsp; SEBI has been intelligent enough to help companies by making this relaxation,&rdquo; says Aakash Choubey, Partner, Khaitan &amp;amp;amp; Co.  THE PRICING FACTOR  Pricing is always an important criterion for such equity issues, but this time Sebi has left the pricing norms for preferential allotment unchanged. Choubey wonders if the move would be enough to help companies deal with liquidity issues. Since there is no relaxation on floor pricing, companies may find it an expensive option.  Unlike rights issue, preferential issues are carried out via a SEBI- approved formula at an average price of the last two weeks or past 26 weeks, whichever is higher. In the COVID-19 era, there is a substantial gap between the current market price and the price arrived at by using the Sebi formula, making it really tough for firms.  As part of the June 16 amendment, Sebi has also relaxed the provision for voluntary open offers by temporarily removing a disqualification condition.  Earlier, a shareholder with 25 per cent or more shares or voting rights was permitted to make a voluntary open offer, but only if he had not acquired any shares of the company via the creeping acquisition route in the preceding 52 weeks.  That condition has now been relaxed till March 31, 2021, giving a fresh option to promoters to consolidate their holdings, but less than the overall public shareholding threshold of 75 per cent.  REDUCING THE QIP COOLING-OFF PERIOD  As part of the changes notified on June 16, the market regulator also substantially reduced the mandatory gap between back-to-back qualified institutional placements or QIPs by a listed firm to two weeks. Earlier, firms were required to maintain a gap of six months between two QIPs.  Will this help?  &ldquo;Possibly -- for those firms that need money in quick succession,&rdquo; feels Bhagat. Capital market experts believe the move will help corporates time their fund-raising plans better and give them greater flexibility to launch share sales based on share price movement.  But then there are those who wonder if issuers can execute deals so quickly today and if risk-averse investors would be comfortable with such short gaps.  Fund-raising conditions are not ideal for firms outside the heavyweight category. &ldquo;In the current unprecedented situation, investors will prefer to seek safety in established businesses. All over the world, big is becoming bigger. In such a scenario, investors will prefer to be with leaders, which, by definition, are large-cap companies,&rdquo; says Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC.  Interestingly, since 2009, even with a gap of nine months between subsequent QIPs, only four placements emerge, according to Prime Database. The list includes Unitech Ltd and 3i Infotech in 2009, Mannapuram General Finance &amp;amp;amp; Leasing in 2010 and Dhanalaxmi Bank in 2013. Unitech had the shortest gap of 71 days.   (Source: PRIME Database)  Between March 25, 2020 (the beginning of the nationwide lockdown) and June 3, 2020, Indian companies raised Rs 7,443 crore via the QIP route, which represents a 135 per cent &nbsp;increase, compared to the same period last year.  FY 2019-20 was an active period for the QIP route, with corporates raising Rs 51,216 crore from 13 QIPs. In FY 18-19, Rs 10,489 crore was raised from the same number of QIPs. &nbsp;Both QIPs and preferential issues require shareholder approval via a special resolution.  The path has been set for a smooth sail for the small-cap and mid-cap companies. But are these measures enough and are more required? The markets will provide the clue in the coming days."

The company said it has become completely net debt-free and has raised over Rs 1.68 lakh crore in just 58 days, hinting that it will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world.  Stock market expert SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18 that the stock of Reliance Industries may see a big re-rating. He has a target of Rs 1,900 on the stock, which Tulsian believes, it can achieve by March 2021.  Tulsian sees retail as the next growth driver for Reliance.  &amp;quot;The company's first goal of being debt-free has been achieved and now he does not see any further dilution in Jio Platform. The next growth area will be Reliance Retail,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;quot;If you compare Reliance Retail with DMart, having a market capitalisation of 1.5 lakh crore with the topline of 25,000 crore, Reliance Retail has a topline of about 2 lakh crore. So, it is about 7 times the size of the topline. I guess the valuation of Reliance Retail can be between 4-5 lakh crore,&amp;quot; Tulsian said.  &amp;quot;Probably the process of the induction of strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail will happen like in Jio Platform,&amp;quot; said Tulsian.  Tulsian said Jio may not see Indian listing as it will not be able to capture full value of the stock.  Jio may see an overseas listing in the next couple of years to give maximum value to the Reliance shareholders. Because if Jio is listed on Indian bourses, then the discounting of the holding company will start and Reliance Industries may not capture the true value. But if the Jio Platform is listed overseas then the holding company can capture the full value.

What about the allotment? What should be the next strategy? Should we hold or sell?  First of all, partly paid-up rights issue shareholders should thoroughly track the underlying shares of Reliance Industries, which was trading at Rs 1,572 as on June 10. The next strategy should be discovering the price of partially paid-up rights issue.  Take into consideration the closing price of Rs 1,572. Now, we have to find out the listing price of partly paid-up share by subtracting, (CMP &ndash; remaining dues), which comes out to Rs 942.75.  Rs 314.25 has to be paid by May 2021 and remaining Rs 628.50 by November 2021.  Now, the present value of Rs 942.75, on a risk-free return of 6 percent, comes to around Rs 875 (round off). Hence, on current CMP of Rs 1,572, the listing price should be Rs 697 (1,572-875).  To hold or sell on listing day?  Those who get a direct advantage of the rights issue through holding generally are long-term investors. Therefore, they can opt to &ldquo;retain&rdquo; with a long-term view.  Those who bought Rights Entitlement (RE) from the secondary market or have a short-term outlook are expected to get a very handsome return on investment (ROI) on current market price considering an investment amount of around Rs 525-535 (Rs 314.25 paid up amount plus Rs 210-220 RE value). As a result, the investor can easily generate expected ROI of 30-35 percent in just a month. Hence, we recommend that &ldquo;sell&rdquo; on listing day would be a better option for short-term investors.  Note: Rs 1,572 is an example of the current market price. It is better to take a decision on basis of the closing price of the day before the listing.  What to track?  Reliance has already sold stake worth Rs 97,885.65 crore in Jio Platforms to global investors. This would help the digital platform to grow and deleverage the balance sheet.  In addition, the company is progressing well with Saudi Aramco to sell a 20 percent stake in oil-to-chemicals business, which would significantly add net cash and make it financially stronger.  In the retail business, the closure of stores and malls has lead to lower footfalls. However, we expect this will scale up rapidly led by JioMart and pharmacy platform. Hence, overall our outlook is positive for the company in the long run.  (The author is Senior Research Analyst at Rudra Shares &amp;amp;amp; Stock Brokers Ltd.)

The flurry of deals marks the largest continuous fundraising activity by a company in the world.  The deals have taken place despite the global economy hobbling due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The headline-grabbing combined amount raised by Jio is equivalent to some of the important economic activities in India.  Below are some comparisons that offer context to the significance of Jio's dealmaking prowess:  - The total money raised by Jio is almost equal to Foreign Institutional Investor, or FII, investment in the Indian equity market in 2019 &mdash; Rs 1,01,122 crore.    - More than total foreign direct investment (FDI) in India in the March quarter 2020: Rs 95,549 crore.  -&nbsp; It is comparable to FII outflow from the Indian debt and equity market in 2020 so far - Rs 1,11,878 crore.    - It is nearly 50 percent of FDI in the Indian telecommunication sector in the past 20 years - Rs 2,19,189 crore.  -It is more than 1/4th of total FDI in India in FY 2020 - Rs 3,53,558 crore.  -&nbsp; It is more than double of Domestic Institutional Investors net inflow in the Indian equity market in 2019 - Rs 42,174 crore.   -It is almost one-third of the market cap of Jio's closest competitor &ndash; Bharti Airtel - Rs 3,09,657 crore   (Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd., which also owns Jio, is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd)"

Here is what to watch out for next with respect to mega rights issue:  1&amp;amp;gt; Basis of Allotment: The company will finalize the basis of allotment of rights issue shares on or about June 10, 2020.  a&amp;amp;gt; Full allotment will be made to those eligible equity shareholders who have applied for their Rights Entitlements of rights equity shares either in full or in part and also to the renouncee(s) who has or have applied for rights equity shares renounced in their favour, in full or in part.  b&amp;amp;gt; Eligible equity shareholders whose fractional entitlements are being ignored and eligible equity shareholders with zero entitlement, would be given preference in allotment of one additional Rights equity share each if they apply for additional rights equity shares. Allotment for these shareholders will be considered if there are any unsubscribed rights equity shares after allotment under (a) above.  c&amp;amp;gt; In case of application for additional rights equity shares by eligible equity shareholders, allotment will be at the sole discretion of the board in consultation with the Designated Stock Exchange.  d&amp;amp;gt; In case of application for additional rights equity shares by renouncees, allotment will be made if there is surplus available after making full allotment to eligible equity shareholders.  2&amp;amp;gt; Transfer of Rights issue shares: The Rights equity shares will be credited to the demat account of eligible shareholders and renouncees on or about June 11.  3&amp;amp;gt; Refund: In case of non-allotment or partial allotment, surplus application money will be refunded to the investor after finalization of basis of allotment in consultation with Designated Stock Exchange.  4&amp;amp;gt; Listing of Partly Paid Up Rights issue shares: The rights shares credited to shareholders are called partly paid-up rights shares as shareholders made only part payment (first instalment of Rs 314.25 out of total issue price of Rs 1,257 per share) against these shares. These shares will be separately listed on bourses on June 12 with a separate ISIN ID.  The closing price before listing these shares would be intrinsic value + first instalment (Rs 314.25).

The investment by Mubadala, which manages about $229 billion in assets, at an equity value of Rs 4.91 lakh crore and an enterprise value of Rs 5.16 lakh crore takes the total amount raised by Jio to an eye-popping Rs 87,655.35 crore, according to a statement by RIL.  Jio Platforms, which runs movie, news and music apps as well as the telecom enterprise Jio Infocomm, has now sold a combined stake of 18.97 percent in six massive fundraising deals.  The series of deals was led by Facebook Inc, which invested Rs 43,574 crore to buy 9.99 percent on April 22.&nbsp; Since then, General Atlantic, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners and KKR together spent Rs 78,562 crore on Jio.  Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries (RIL), said he was delighted that Mubadala, one of the most astute and transformational global growth investors, has decided to partner his company in its journey to propel India&rsquo;s digital growth towards becoming a leading digyal nation in the world. &ldquo;Through my longstanding ties with Abu Dhabi, I have personally seen the impact of Mubadala&rsquo;s work in diversifying and globally connecting the UAE&rsquo;s knowledge-based economy.

With Jio&rsquo;s network of investors and partners, we believe that the platform company will further the development of the digital economy.&amp;quot;  Mubadala is billed as the second-biggest state investor after Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. It has more than 50 businesses and investments in more than 50 countries.  Mubadala typically makes investments in enterprises that create lasting value and positive economic and social impact in communities at home and overseas, according to its website. Its portfolio companies are spread in sectors such as aerospace, agribusiness, ICT, semiconductors, metals and mining, pharmaceutical and medical technology, renewable energy and utilities.

The four that saw their brand value inching up were - Tata Steel, Vedanta, JSW Steel and SAIL. On the other hand, Hindalco and Coal India saw their brand value diminishing.  The ranking was done by Brand Finance India, in its&nbsp;latest 2020 report.  Coming at the top was Tata Steel, also the largest Indian steelmaker. Its brand value went up by 16 percent to $1.3 billion, from $1.16 billion last year. Vedanta came in second, with its brand value increasing by 10.5 percent to $786 million. JSW Steel was third, with a brand value of $719 million, up 8.6 percent.  Hindalco, part of the Aditya Birla Group, saw its brand value drop by 6.4 percent, to $416 million.

Reliance Industries was among the biggest gainers, with its brand value up 25 percent.  Trying times  Despite Tata Steel's top billing in the metals and mining sector, the company has been facing headwinds, both in its domestic and European businesses.  The European arm has been facing a crisis, with workers in the Netherlands plant protesting the exit of a top official. Reports say that the company may be forced to break-up its European operations, and separate the UK business from the Netherlands one.  Vedanta has been in the news recently after it announced plans to de-list from exchanges in India.&nbsp;  JSW Steel, the steelmaker with the highest capacity in India, saw its Q4 profit shrink 87 percent.  While most of these companies have begun ramping up their capacity, after some relaxations during the lockdown, low demand and unavailability of labour continue to create stress.

Justice Mukta Gupta, in two separate interim orders, said RIL and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have made out a prima facie case in their favour and in case no ad-interim injunction is granted they would suffer an irreparable loss and balance of convenience also lies in their favour.  The high court passed the orders Thursday on two suits by RIL saying they are the owners of trademarks and trade names JIO and RELIANCE, with its variations in number of classes and defendants OLX India BV and OLX India Pvt Ltd and Quikr India Pvt Ltd are causing immense harm and irreparable injury to their goodwill and reputation.  The web portals are engaged in publishing classified advertisements and they enable consumers to publish advertisements for selling and offering goods and services for a consideration.  The lawsuits said fake and fraudulent recruitment advertisements were being published on the defendants' web portals which are accessible under various words like &ldquo;JIO JOBS, RELIANCE TRENDS JOBS&rdquo; and this infringes the plaintiffs' trademark and trade name JIO and RELIANCE.  It said their trademark was being used and a number of innocent job seekers are duped and money is being extorted from them.  The lawsuit against Quikr said that the web portal also operates as an online recruitment website facilitating consumers to advertise job vacancies.  It said that the defendant categorises its customers who are job seekers into three different categories such as &lsquo;Gold', &lsquo;Rapid Hire' and &lsquo;Spot Light' thereby charging its customers on the basis of facilities which they would be able to avail from this portal.  The counsel for OLX India submitted before the high court that they have removed some of the URLs and due to technical reasons, one URL could not be removed and they are in the process of doing it.  They further said they have also added filters with the words &lsquo;JIO and RELIANCE' so that in future nobody can misuse their platform with these false and fictitious advertisements so as to defraud the job seekers and infringe the plaintiffs' trademarks or trade names.  The counsel for Quikr India said the listings on its portal are automatic and in view of the large number of people listing their advertisements on the web portal and the system being auto generated, the web portal has no mechanism to ascertain the authenticity of the third parties.  The counsel said as and when any party lodges a complaint, the defendant pulls down the concerned URL and in this case on being informed that these two URLs are fake, it would immediately pull them down.  The high court, in its order passed in Quikr case, said &ldquo;Consequently, till the next date of hearing, defendant, its agents, servants, affiliates are also restrained from putting on their portal any advertisement containing the name/mark JIO and RELIANCE with its variations and/or any other mark, logo which is deceptively/confusingly similar to the plaintiffs' registered trademarks JIO and RELIANCE in terms of prayer&hellip;&rdquo;  The high court also issued summons to OLX India and Quikr India on the lawsuits and listed the matter for further hearing on September 21.

To subscribe to the issue, an upfront payment of 25 percent could be done and for the remaining amount payment to be done in tranches of 25 percent in May 2021 and balance 50 percent to be paid in November 2021.  Taking example of 1 share held, the shareholder needs to pay: 1) 25 percent upfront which is Rs 314.25 2) 25 percent in May 2021 - Rs 314.25 3) 50 percent in November 2021 - Rs 628.50  The entitlement is being credited to the demat account of the shareholder. Rights holders will be able to trade their entitlement on a separate window which is RIL-RE on exchanges till May 29 2020 where shareholders can sell and renounce their entitlement.  Leverage Benefit  As only 25 percent of the payment being made upfront, buyer can be saved and avail the benefit of leverage by paying the installments after one year.  For instance, if an investor thinks that Reliance will appreciate by 20 percent in next 1 year then the difference of leverage is given below:-  Reliance Industries current market price is Rs 1,440  A) If one investor bought 1 share from stock exchange at Rs 1,440 and suppose it is appreciated by Rs 288 (20 percent) in next one year then the return on investment (RoI) will be 20 percent.  B) Another investor bought Reliance entitlement at Rs 232 and paid upfront payment of 25 percent which is Rs 314.25. On total, he paid Rs 546.25 whereas he is also getting the whole benefit of appreciation which is around Rs 288 (as stated above). In such case, his RoI is boosted to 52.72 percent which is almost thrice in comparison to the first case (A).  Trading of these Rights Entitlement (RE) will be allowed only till May 29, which is being monitored by SEBI.  Discovery of RE price  If we calculate the fair value of RE, which should be paid by the buyer to seller is around Rs 175.  For applying to the rights issue, investor should get the benefit of Rs 183 (difference between closing price of RIL as on May 21st &amp;amp;amp; Rights issue price). At the time of the discovery price first we will take 25 percent of the difference which is around Rs 46 (because buyer has to pay 25 percent as upfront payment). But it is not true because seller will lose the remaining Rs 137 which he could gain by next year. Hence, we will value this Rs 137 by time value factor of 1 year, discounted at 6 percent (risk-free return).  The present value comes at around Rs 129 and the fair value of RE turns into Rs 175 (129+46).  Thus, the main reason of RE trading in premium from their discovery price is to get the leverage benefit by the investors.  What should you do?  In case you want to invest in RIL, so instead of investing in Reliance Industries share, one should go for RIL-RE as the immediate benefit of leverage can be availed and Reliance has so much of hidden value which could be seen in their share price in coming years.

The lockdown and travel curbs aimed at stemming spread of COVID-19 since March 25 forced people to stay home, cutting India's fuel demand by 45.8 percent in April.  Falling demand led Indian refiners and gas importers to declare force majeure on imports.  Refiners, struggling to store oil and products, had to sell some oil to the federal government which used it to fill strategic storage.  India has extended its nationwide restrictions to May 31, but relaxed rules in areas with lower numbers of cases leading to some recovery in fuel demand and refiner runs this month.  Indian refiners operated at about 72 percent of their overall capacity of about 5 million bpd, the data showed.  Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, operated its plant at about 53 percent capacity, while use at the refineries owned by its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum plunged to about 33 percent of capacity, the data showed.

This Rights Issue looks and is also similar to most rights issues opened in the past for various companies except one thing which has set this issue apart from others in past.  Yes, from this current Reliance Rights Issue we have been experiencing a historical first trading of Rights Entitlements through exchange mechanism which was also happening earlier but only in offline market and with physical form mostly.  This new introduction has opened opportunity for many retail investors to either participate in the rights issue like normally and also sell their eligible/entitled portion of shares to other willing investors who may have missed the opportunity due to lapse of record date or want to bid for higher number of shares than originally entitled ration of one rights share for every fifteen equity shares of Reliance Industries.  Not only this, the current mechanism has also opened up various opportunities for arbitrage seeking players who could benefit from the momentary mispricing between rights issue and fully paid up equity shares. Hence providing both depth and liquidity in the markets during the process.  Now without taking much time, let's look what are the details of this offer and what kind of opportunities are or could arise out of the present situation.  Firstly, let us see the details of the offer briefly below;    So, above is the snapshot of the rights issue offer presently on offer by Reliance Industries which the shareholders can apply through provided mechanism detailed by the company.  Now coming to the new exchange traded entitlement mechanism which has been effected from this and hopefully continue to forthcoming issues as well. Let us understand how this works.  Exchange Traded Entitlement Mechanism:  The exchange traded entitlement (Rights Entitlement) which has been effective as mentioned in below table is basically a mechanism where the participants who want to subscribe for more than the allotted shares in the rights issue can buy such rights entitlements from the exchange window and become eligible for the application and similarly vice versa.    Now, with this the new mechanism an opportunity arises for both the normal shareholders as well as the arbitragers who could gain whenever mispricing is available in the markets. But before detailing that, let us first simply understand what is the actual value of rights issue since, it is not paid in full on June 3, 2020 but in three instalments over eighteen months timeline.    In the above table we have calculated a simple present value of the payments any person is going to make to subscribe to the rights issue. As already known that payments are scheduled in three parts over next eighteen months hence an investor is just paying only 25 percent of the amount initially and remaining amount is paid over eighteen months. Hence, this remaining amount is available to an investor in cash to earn either interest if deposited in banks or earn capital gains if invested in markets.  Thus, we have assumed two scenarios wherein we assume that an investor could earn 10 percent or 6 percent of the remaining 75 percent of amount till he is called in to pay these instalments by the company. So in this case we have discounted back the instalments with these assumed rates and calculated that the estimated present value of the rights issue which is available at Rs 1,257 per rights share at 10 percent discount rate is Rs 1,141 and at 6 percent discount rate is Rs 1,184.  Now in below table we see how to calculate the value of rights renunciation (Rights Entitlement), in this case RIL-RE which is currently trading in exchanges.    There are two aspects namely fixed and variable while pricing rights renunciation as mentioned in above table. The fixed aspect is arrived by deducting present value calculated from rights price of Rs 1,257 which in this case is Rs 115.8 at 10 percent discount rate and Rs 72.64 at 6 percent discount rate, since the rights price is fixed hence it is called fixed component.  To arrive at the variable component we have to take into account the difference between current prices of the Reliance Industries fully paid equity shares and rights price and then add it to the previous fixed component. In this case it is Rs 184.25 and because the CMP of Reliance changes daily hence this difference is dynamic and called as variable component.  Thus, the value of rights renunciation (RE) should theoretically be about Rs 300 at 10 percent and Rs 257 at 6 percent discount rates, respectively.  Execution aspects of the trade:  As we have arrived at the present value and estimated the value at which Reliance RE units should trade and also similarly after the allotment of rights share the rights share should also trade with similar values while adding the paid amount to the already calculated RIL-RE values.  However, as an investor or a trader let's look at various execution strategies one could do to benefit out of this mechanism.  1.&amp;amp;gt; Buying Rights Entitlement units: Any investor who wants to have an exposure in Reliance equity shares can instead subscribe for rights issue by simply buying the Reliance Industries - Rights entitlement units (RIL-RE) from exchanges at prices lower than his/her discounted rates as shown in above examples and could earn some additional returns over and above the return given by the underlying Reliance shares. Table below shows relationship between discount rate, RIL-RE price and expected return an investor could generate.    2.&amp;amp;gt; Selling Existing shares and buying same through RIL-RE mechanism: Any investor who already has invested in the fully paid Reliance shares have an opportunity to lower their cost of acquisition by executing below mentioned trades. As seen in the table below an existing share can lower his acquisition cost by this strategy. And also enjoys an additional liquidity of Rs 893.4 per share for the next one year as second instalment is due not before May-2021 and can generate additional returns from this amount by investing in any asset class of his/her choice.  The overall risk profile to the trade is similar as was before which is exposure to Reliance Industries equity and its price movements.

The credit rating agency comment on a day when Reliance announced sale of 2.32 percent stake in Jio Platforms to global investment firm KKR &amp;amp;amp; Co. Inc for Rs 11,367 crore -- the fifth deal in four weeks that will inject a combined Rs 78,562 crore in the oil-to-telecom conglomerate to help it pare debt.  &amp;quot;Proceeds from these divestments alone will help the company pare around 49 percent of its net debt of Rs 1.61 lakh crore outstanding as of March 31, 2020,&amp;quot; Moody's said in an issuer note.  Exactly a month back, Facebook picked up 9.99 percent stake in the firm that houses India's youngest but largest telecom company for Rs 43,574 crore.  Within days of that deal, Silver Lake -- the world's largest tech investor -- bought 1.15 percent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 5,665.75 crore.  On May 8, US-based Vista Equity Partners bought 2.32 percent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 11,367 crore and on May 17 global equity firm General Atlantic picked up 1.34 percent stake for Rs 6,598.38 crore.  &amp;quot;These divestments are credit positive because proceeds from sales of the stakes will be used for debt reduction and bring the company closer to its target of reducing its net debt to zero by March 2021,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  All the transactions are currently underway and subject to regulatory and other approvals.  &amp;quot;Successful completion of the transactions will help to alleviate the negative impact of lower earnings caused by disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak,&amp;quot; it added.  The rating agency expects a 16-17 percent drop in Reliance's consolidated EBITDA for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, compared to fiscal 2020.  While EBITDA for the company's digital services segment will continue to grow during the coronavirus outbreak, it expects EBITDA for the refining and petrochemical segments to be weaker as a standstill in global travel and slowdown in economic activity will weaken the demand for transportation fuel and petrochemicals.  &amp;quot;As a result, we expect RIL's leverage, as measured by adjusted net debt/EBITDA, to remain appropriately positioned for its current rating,&amp;quot; it said.  Other steps taken by the company to reduce its net debt to zero include the partial divestment of its oil-to-chemical business (USD 15 billion) and fuel retailing business (USD 1 billion) to Saudi Aramco and BP Plc, respectively.  In addition, Reliance hanced a rights issue offering to raise around Rs 53,215 crore and use the proceeds toward debt reduction, it added.

Ambani had in August last year unveiled plans to cut debt to zero by 2021. As part of this plan, RIL has been seeking strategic partnerships across its businesses, while targeting to deleverage the balance sheet.  At the end of March quarter, RIL had an outstanding debt of Rs 3,36,294 crore. It also had cash in hand of Rs 1,75,259 crore, bringing the net debt position to Rs 1,61,035 crore.  As part of its balance sheet deleveraging plans, Reliance has sold a minority stake in its digital unit, Jio Platforms to the likes of Facebook.  It is also talking to Saudi Aramco for selling a fifth of its oil-to-chemicals business for an asking of USD 15 billion and has sold half of its fuel retail venture to BP Plc for Rs 7,000 crore and telecommunication tower business to Brookfield for Rs 25,200 crore.

The company said the proposed rights issuance will be the first by RIL in three decades. This rights issue is a part of the company's deleveraging plan and as a result, the company will be net debt free by March 31, 2021.  Reliance Industries has already garnered Rs 67,195 crore through stake sale in Jio Platforms in four weeks ahead of its rights issue.  Reliance Industries sold a total of 14.81 percent stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, Jio Platforms, to three private equity investors - Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners and General Atlantic&nbsp;- and Facebook Inc.  Facebook deal was the biggest as Jio raised Rs 43,574 crore by selling 9.99 percent stake to the WhatsApp owner.  Here are the five most important things that investors must know about the Reliance rights issue:  Opening and Closing Dates  The subscription for rights issue will open on May 20 and the closing date is June 3, 2020.  Rights Issue Size  Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries' rights issue size is Rs 53,125 crore and it will issue 42,26,26,894 equity shares.  Issue Price  India's biggest ever right issue has been priced at Rs 1,257 per share which had ex-right date at May 13, 2020.  Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities feels rights issue is fairly priced. &amp;quot;As against the last closing price of RIL shares of Rs 1,458.90 on May 15, the rights issue price of Rs 1,257 apiece is decently attractive, with a discount of 16 percent.  Rights Issue Ratio  The rights entitlement ratio is 1 equity share for every 15 equity shares held by eligible shareholders as on the record date which was May 14  Terms of Payment of Issue Price  The terms of payment will be 25 percent on application and balance in one or more calls as may be decided by the board of directors from time to time.  At the time of application, shareholders will pay Rs 314.25 per rights equity share (face value Rs 2.50 + premium Rs 311.75), and the balance amount of Rs 942.75 will be payable in one or more subsequent calls as determined by the board of directors, from time to time.  Accordingly, the company proposed the schedule for payment of the balance amount of Rs 942.75 per rights equity share. Shareholders can pay Rs 314.25 i.e. 25 percent in May 2021; and Rs 628.50 i.e. the balance 50 percent in November 2021.  Promoters Commitment  Promoter and promoter group with 50.07 percent stake have pledged to buy the full extent of their entitlement and also subscribe to all unsold shares in the rights issue, which shows the promoters commitment and confidence in the company's future growth prospects, Tapse said.  Objects of the Issue  The reason to come out with rights issue to existing shareholder is to pare down the company's debt which over the years has piled up through expansion of its retail and telecom arm and make company a net debt free by March 31, 2021.  Part of Capital Raising Programme  The company is expected to complete the capital raising programme totaling over Rs 1.04 Lakh crore by Q1 of the current financial year. This includes the investment by Facebook in Jio Platforms (already garnered Rs 43,574 crore), the upcoming rights issue and the previous investment by British Petroleum in FY2019-20.

Experts feel the deleveraging process seems to be on a fast track and huge digital opportunities going ahead will take Jio to new scale in terms of business as well as valuations.  &amp;quot;Firstly from value of $50 billion that Facebook had given to now new deal at a premium to even the Facebook deal, 12.5 percent premium, suggested a value of $63-64 billion for Jio Platforms. So at the current level itself there is a scope for higher valuations,&amp;quot; Jal Irani, Senior Vice-President - Wholesale Capital Markets at Edelweiss Financial Services told CNBC-TV18.  &amp;quot;Potential for growth tends to be extremely significant and it is how Reliance will execute this growth which will drive value going forward,&amp;quot; he said.  Siddhartha Khemka, VP - Head of Research (Retail) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services also told Moneycontrol that it is definitely a positive deal with global private equity firms which generally invest for 4-5 years and they are big tech PE firms with large business sense and ideas.  &amp;quot;Net-net the money will be good for their capex and growth plans. With long term support from such PE investors, they can get more ideas from global companies where they invest globally, which will ultimately help Reliance to scale up business very fast in coming years,&amp;quot; he said.  Follow all of our coverage on Jio-Vista Equity Partners deal&nbsp;here  This investment values Jio Platforms at an equity value of Rs 4.91 lakh crore and an enterprise value of Rs 5.16 lakh crore, company in its BSE filing said, adding Vista's investment will translate into a 2.32 percent equity stake in Jio Platforms on a fully diluted basis, making Vista the largest investor in Jio Platforms behind Reliance Industries and Facebook.  &amp;quot;I already said they will be monetising total 15 percent stake, of which they already completed 13.47 percent stake sale (to Facebook, Silver Lake and Vista Equity Partners) and the rest around 1.5 percent will give them additional Rs 7,500 crore. And another 10 percent stake will be retained for IPO which may be likely by March 2021. So Reliance Industries eventually will be wanting to keep 70-75 percent stake of Jio Platforms with themselves,&amp;quot; SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18.  He said so net around Rs 68,000 crore will come in Jio Platforms, and Rs 54,000 crore of rights issue, making total of around Rs 1.22 lakh crore, while the net debt as of March 31, 2020 is Rs 1.61 lakh crore. They are still short of around Rs 40,000 crore which the company needs to garner.  &amp;quot;If I add FY21 cashflow of RIL on standalone basis that gives me around Rs 25,000 crore. Then also there is still a shortage of around Rs 20,000 crore,&amp;quot; he added.  He said Jio Platforms also has debt of Rs 25,000 crore and they would be requiring capex of Rs 30,000-50,000 crore on annual basis as they may be upgrading their technology to 5G.  Hence, Tulsian said eventually the market would be looking that Saudi Aramco deal has to happen. &amp;quot;Originally it was envisaged to be happening at $75 on EV valuation of O2C business. Now I am expecting that to be around $60 a barrel. Even if I take 20 percent dilution of stake that gives me around $12 billion dollars or Rs 90,000 crore.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;So we have about Rs 54,000 crore from rights issue, Rs 90,000 crore from Saudi Aramco deal and Rs 25,000 crore of cash flow FY21 from RIL standalone that makes the perfect equation,&amp;quot; he said.  Siddhartha Khemka feels if debt comes down, the debt rating will improve which will help the company to reduce the cost of debt and as a result overall debt cost of Reliance Industries will also come down.  According to him, Reliance Jio IPO is unlikely before at least next three years given the investment by these PE firms. &amp;quot;Jio Platforms is doing very well and if they continue with small stake sale with global investors then they might not need to do Jio IPO also in future.&amp;quot;  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment expert on Moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

Last week, Reliance announced it will raise Rs 53,100 crore through a rights equity offering.  Also, the company announced an investment of Rs 5,656 crore by Silver Late in Jio Platforms, the digital services business of RIL.  &amp;quot;This is in line with the company's target to reduce its net debt to zero by March 31, 2021. The proceeds from the rights issue will reduce RIL's net debt by about $7.8 billion and is credit positive,&amp;quot; Moody's said in a note.  Along with the previously announced asset sales to Facebook, Inc and BP Plc, RIL expects to generate net proceeds of Rs 1.1 lakh crore, which will reduce its net debt by the same amount.  &amp;quot;The total net debt reduction from completion of these transactions will lower RIL's reported net debt, which was Rs 1.6 lakh crore ($21.4 billion) as on March 31, 2020, by about 68 per cent and will be equivalent to 1.1x its reported EBITDA of Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020,&amp;quot; it said.  In addition, RIL also announced that it has started the process to carve out its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business as a separate subsidiary in order to facilitate the previously announced 20 per cent stake sale in that business to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco).  Despite the coronavirus outbreak and lower oil prices, RIL confirmed that the due diligence process for the transaction is ongoing.  &amp;quot;This increases the likelihood of the transaction going ahead as announced in August 2019,&amp;quot; the rating agency said, adding the transaction with Saudi Aramco values the O2C business at $75 billion and can potentially result in $12-15 billion of cash proceeds for RIL, depending on the amount of debt at the O2C business after the reorganization.  Reliance last week approved the biggest-ever rights issue of Rs 53,100 crore at Rs 1,257 per share.  The company had reported a 10.5 per cent increase in its reported EBITDA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to a year ago.  While the economic shutdowns due to coronavirus outbreak resulted in a decline in earnings from RIL's O2C and retail businesses for the quarter ended March 2020, its earnings from its digital services continued to grow.  &amp;quot;We expect the earnings from its O2C and retail business to see a steeper decline in the quarter ending June 2020 as India's economy is scheduled to be under shutdown for at least 45 days in this quarter. An earnings recovery for these segments will depend on the timing of resumption of economic activity, which remains uncertain at this stage,&amp;quot; it said.  Assuming the economic activity to resume by middle to end of May 2020, the rating agency expected RIL's consolidated EBITDA to decline 10-12 per cent in FY2021 as compared to FY2020. However, the EBITDA is expected to return to FY2020 levels in FY2022 as improved demand in combination with low oil prices will result in higher earnings for the O2C segment, while the earnings growth for retail will resume.  &amp;quot;RIL's recent foray into online retail through its partnership with Whatsapp and Facebook could result in a further boost in its retail earnings, which is currently not factored in our projections,&amp;quot; Moody's said.

Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), had in August last year set a target of March 2021 to make the oil-to-telecom conglomerate net debt-free. But thanks to a $5.7 billion (Rs 43,547 crore) deal with Facebook, a Rs 53,125 crore rights issue and more stake sale to companies such as Saudi Aramco, the target is likely to be achieved by December.  In an investor and media call post announcement of the company's fourth-quarter earnings, RIL's Joint Chief Financial Officer Srikanth Venkatachari said, &amp;quot;The zero net debt target will be achieved within the 2020 calendar year.&amp;quot;  Since the August announcement, Ambani has sold a 9.99 per cent stake in the digital platform that houses India's youngest but biggest mobile operator to Facebook, decided to hive out Reliance's oil and petrochemicals business into a separate entity to help a proposed stake sale to Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco), and pledged to make up for any shortfall in the rights issue.  The company expects to complete a capital raising programme totalling Rs 1.04 lakh crore by June, Venkatachari said.  This includes the rights offering of one share for every 15 shares held at Rs 1,257, a 14 per cent discount to the closing price for April 30. Also included is the Rs 43,574 crore coming from the Facebook buying stake in Jio Platforms and Rs 7,000 crore from sale of 49 per cent stake in fuel retailing venture to UK's BP plc.  &amp;quot;In addition, Saudi Aramco due diligence is progressing well,&amp;quot; he said without saying when the deal was expected to be closed.  Reliance values its oil-to-chemical business, which includes its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, petrochemical assets, and 51 per cent stake in auto fuel and aviation fuel retailing venture, at $75 billion. Saudi Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in this venture.  Alongside announcing the zero net debt target, Ambani, 63, had in August also announced the potential sale of 20 per cent interest in the oil-to-chemical business to Aramco by March 2020. That deadline has been missed partly because of differences over the deal structure and partly due to talks stalling following the outbreak of coronavirus and the subsequent nationwide lockdown.  At the end of March quarter, the company had an outstanding debt of Rs 336,294 crore and cash in hand of Rs 175,259 crore. After adjusting cash, the net debt came to Rs 161,035 crore.  Of this debt, Rs 2,62,000 crore is on RIL books and Rs 23,000 crore is with Jio.  At the concall, company officials said Jio Platforms will retain Rs 14,976 crore out of Rs 43,574 crore received from Facebook and use the remaining Rs 28,598 crore to settle the debt.  The Facebook-Jio Platforms deal will close by the end of the current quarter.  Also, the company said it has received interest from new potential global strategic and financial investors in taking a stake of similar size to Facebook's agreement in the Jio Platform.  &amp;quot;In addition to the FB investment, the board was informed that RIL has received strong interest from other strategic and financial investors and is in good shape to announce a similar-sized investment in the coming months,&amp;quot; the company had said in a statement on Thursday.  &amp;quot;With a strong visibility to these equity infusions, the board was informed that RIL is set to achieve net-zero debt status ahead of its own aggressive timeline,&amp;quot; it had said.

Petrochemicals segment EBIT was at Rs 4,553 crore ($0.6 billion), down 42.8 percent YoY, with a significant decline in margins. The impact of lower product margins was mitigated to some extent by optimizing feedstock mix during the quarter.

Apart from the several firsts and landmarks the $5.7 billion deal has achieved, it is also unparalleled in the impact it will have on&nbsp;stakeholders - from the two partners and shareholders to industry peers and most importantly, the consumers.  First, let's see how the Indian consumer, the focal point of the deal, could benefit.  Imagine a single digital platform that will probably answer each and every need of a customer. Here is a shortened list of what all one could do -  	Calling, messaging and sharing documents 	Booking tickets for movies or IPL 	Buying groceries, shoes, apparel or even jewellery from outlets close to your homes 	Creating and editing videos 	Playing games 	Making payments or transferring money 	Catching up on news  One could go on.  Those who run businesses can add a few more to the list:  	Getting loans 	Filing returns or GST 	Getting tech help for business  And many more.  What's in it for Facebook?  India may be already the biggest market for Facebook (260 million users), WhatsApp (400 million users), and the second largest for Instagram (80 million users).  But Facebook intended to do more, especially after it was forced to shut down Free Basics in 2016.  Now it can use Jio's subscriber base of nearly 400 million users to reach out to customers, businessmen and youngsters! For instance, the moment Facebook&nbsp;launches its short-form video app Lasso on Jio's platform it will immediately become bigger than TikTok, the Chinese app that is immensely popular in India.  TikTok currently has about 200 million users in India.  Facebook will bank on this investment, which at&nbsp;$5.7 billion is the highest the American multinational has invested outside its home market,&nbsp;to drive its future growth in India.  By the way, it's also the highest any firm has paid for a minority stake in a technology company, anywhere in the world.  Plus-plus for RIL  In hindsight, &nbsp;Chairman Mukesh Ambani had probably set the stage for the deal with Facebook, back in August 2019.  In&nbsp;his speech while addressing the company's 42nd Annual General Meeting on August 12, 2019, Ambani said the company had a &ldquo;very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company by March 31, 2021.&rdquo;  The $5.7 billion investment from the American major is a significant step towards that goal. RIL is also in talks with Saudi Aramco, to sell 20 percent stake in its oil-to-chemicals division.  For Jio, the deal is a leap over its peers, including Bharti Airtel. The RIL arm will now have the opportunity to slew up several deals with Facebook that will be exclusive to Jio subscribers.  Significant takeaways for shareholders  For investors badgered by the COVID-19 crisis, the deal comes like a breath of fresh air.  RIL stock was up 8 percent in early trades, on April 22.  Its shareholders are already delighted by the benefits the deal brings. The learnings from Facebook will be significant as RIL evolves from a commodity-led company to one that deals with data, clearly the new oil.  The shareholders will be equally delighted by the prospects of Jio, and its possible IPO. The deal values Jio at&nbsp;Rs 4.62 lakh crore, catapulting it to the top five leagues in market cap. Jio is no longer just a telecom company, but a technology major.  A leg up for Indian economy&nbsp;  Facebook's investment is a significant vote for RIL, and also a vindication of the potential that the Indian economy still holds. The $5.7 billion investment is its bet on the domestic market.  COVID-19 may have added to the sluggishness that was already there in the domestic economy, and downward revisions in GDP forecasts have further dimmed sentiments.  The deal, apart from being the first piece of good news for Indian business in a while, underlines the potential the Indian market holds, especially once the COVID-19 cloud clears.

Touted as the largest FDI in the technology sector in India, the investment values Jio Platforms amongst the top 5 listed companies in India by market capitalisation, within just three and a half years of the launch of its commercial services, it said in a statement.  Following the announcement, Jal Irani of Edelweiss Securities assigned sum-of-the-parts enterprise value of $40.5 billion to Jio citing Whatsapp and JioMart's formidable partnership. However, he believes that the deal is overvalued and has an outperformance call on RIL.  Read all Facebook-Jio deal-related news here.  Since its launch in late 2016, the company&nbsp;has become India's top telecom operator amassing a user base of 370 million&nbsp;through a barrage of innovations, including offering cut-throat mobile internet prices and a diverse suite of products and including chat services, movies, games and music.  In its bid to make the telecom company net-debt free by 2020, RIL in October 2019 set up Jio Platforms to house all its digital assets including Jio. The new wholly-owned subsidiary absorbed RIL's&nbsp;equity investment of Rs 65,000 crore in Jio.  While the move did not alter RIL&rsquo;s consolidated debt position, it helped deleverage the digital platforms and telecom services business, priming it for a potential stake sale.  &amp;quot;Given the reach and scale of our digital ecosystem, we have received strong interest from potential strategic partners,&amp;quot; Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said at the announcement of Jio Platform. &amp;quot;We will induct the right partners in our Platform Company, creating and unlocking meaningful value for RIL shareholders.&amp;quot;  Also Read:&nbsp;Reliance Jio-Facebook: Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s RIL one step closer to zero-debt plan  Following the announcement in October 2019, global brokerage house Jefferies assigned an&nbsp;enterprise value of $65 billion-$70 billion to Jio Platforms,&nbsp;the most valued in the world in terms of EV/Ebitda after Amazon, according to a report in Fortune India.  The report in November pegged&nbsp;RIL&rsquo;s EV/Ebitda at 22.6 (assuming a valuation of $65 billion-$70 billion). At the time, Amazon enjoyed an EV/Ebitda of 23.4, much higher than other tech giants such as Alibaba at 22.1, Alphabet (15.5), Tencent&nbsp;(19.6), Facebook (13.9), and Apple&nbsp;(17.5).  &amp;quot;The reorganisation will increase standalone liabilities but Reliance hopes that will be able to monetise its stake in the platform's business at premium valuations. An EV of $65-70 billion for the platforms entity will imply a hefty estimate of 1.75 times the net invested capital, in our estimate,&amp;quot; analysts at Jefferies had said.  Meanwhile, CLSA assigned a sum-of-the-parts enterprise value of $45 billion to Jio at that time.  &amp;quot;In most valuations used by the Street, including ours, Jio is valued mainly as a telecom service provider with no value ascribed for Jio&rsquo;s suite of apps, digital investments and capabilities like AI, IoT etc. This exercise aims to correct that positioning. Indeed, some of Jio's apps like TV, music and cinema are among the best in their respective categories,&amp;quot; the CLSA report stated.  In March, analysts at Bernstein had valued Jio more than $60 billion citing that the company will lead India's transition from 2G to 4G with the advent of JioPhone.

The issue, which had hit the market Thursday, has been mostly subscribed by State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, the source added.  The company was planning to mop up Rs 9,000 crore in two tranches of Rs 4,500 crore each in with a fixed rate and floating rate coupons of 7.20 percent.  It can be noted that RIL is the most-cash rich company as also one of the most indebted corporates sitting on debt pile of over Rs 1.54 lakh crore as of March 2020.  According to an exchange filing, RIL would use the proceeds from the NCD sale to repay existing rupee loans and would be issued through a private placement of consisting of 30,000 unsecured redeemable fixed coupon, non-convertible debentures under the PPD (privately placed debentures) series K1.

Earlier this week the RBI however, restricted single company exposure to 10 percent of the raised amount - which means say if SBI has mopped Rs 10,000 crore through this route it can invest only Rs 1,000 crore of this in the RIL issue.  According to media reports, the TLTRO window is being tapped by HDFC, PowerGrid, NHB and also Hudco.  The Reserve Bank announced the TLTRO at lower yields to be parked in the secondary market and invest in primary issues as part of its initiatives to help borrowers cope with the economic damage inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Earlier in the day on Friday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that it has been decided to conduct targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO 2.0) for an aggregate amount of Rs 50,000 crore, to begin with, in tranches of appropriate sizes.

",,"Business, Morgan Stanley, Reliance Industries Ltd",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ril39s-net-debt-to-fall-despite-struggling-energy-retail-demanddelayasset-sales_13654301.html,"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd's net debt will fall even if energy and retail demand struggles for six months and the planned asset sales are delayed, analysts said. Also, RIL can re-prioritise investment, potentially slowing capex by up to a third. Beyond COVID-19, RIL emerges stronger as competitors face high debt challenges and slow investments, Morgan Stanley said in a research report.  With the outbreak of coronavirus impacting economies globally, RIL faces multiple challenges -- oil prices have declined along with a fall in global oil product demand as a result of the lockdown across India and multiple geographies, potential slowdown in fashion/electronics demand for its retail segment, slower monetisation of telecom investments, and still relatively high debt post the investment cycle.  Consequently, RIL's share price has dropped 21 per cent year-to-date, but still out-performed the market by 7 percentage points.  Morgan Stanley said the timing of normalisation is unclear, and every month of these challenges negatively affects RIL sales volumes across all its businesses.  But competition is struggling even more, and cyclical businesses could get more medium-term tailwinds as capacity growth globally slows.  Morgan Stanley said the decline in global energy demand and expansion in credit default swap (CDS) spreads for RIL, to 290 bps over the past month, have raised investor questions about the company's balance sheet leverage. &amp;quot;Per our assessment, RIL's net debt (including other liabilities) would remain stable in FY21, if the COVID-19 situation were to persist for six months and recover only slowly thereafter.&amp;quot;  RIL, it said, has the flexibility to prioritise its investments in FY21, and could thereby reduce cash outlay by 25-30 per cent. Still, capex on ongoing upstream gas production, telecom spectrum renewal, and maintenance may be required.  Stating that RIL's net debt might not rise in 2020-21, Morgan Stanley said its analysis suggests limited liquidity challenges even if the company's utilisation rates and margins remain challenges in its cash cow energy business.  Also, about half of RIL's debt and liabilities are largely&nbsp;USD funded, hedged via its dollar-linked energy cashflows. However, RIL could raise debt, as some of its creditor liabilities fall due or for refinancing.  &amp;quot;We expect Reliance to gain market share with better profitability as the current demand decline is driving global refiners and oil majors alike to reassess growth plans to conserve cash. This provides a significant headstart for RIL, which has expanded and upscaled its capabilities over the past five years and now is among the top quartile on the cost curve,&amp;quot; it said adding oversupplied oil markets as chemical/ refinery markets tighten are a significant tailwind, as well.  Its strong energy backed cash-flows should help gain market share faster in offline retail and telecom segments, as competition conserves cash, it added. &amp;quot;RIL's net debt will fall even if energy and retail demand struggles for six months and asset sales are delayed.&amp;quot;  RIL has consolidated net debt and liabilities of $46.2 billion and an annual pre-tax profit of $13.6 billion.  The company has previously announced plans to monetise many of its assets, including holdings in energy, telecom, and content businesses. These plans, if executed, could lower debt by about $39 billion, but would also lower earnings by 16 per cent.  Saudi Aramco is&nbsp;still conducting due diligence on a potential investment in RIL's oil-to-chemicals operation.

Drawing strength from its presence in varied sectors, RIL is looking to ensure that all its subsidiaries pull out all stops to support the government in its efforts to contain the deadly coronavirus outbreak.  It has undertaken many steps as part of its multi-pronged prevention, mitigation, and ongoing support strategy. In collaboration with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital has set up a dedicated 100-bed centre at Seven Hills Hospital, Mumbai, for patients who test positive for COVID-19. The facility, fully funded by the Reliance Foundation, includes a negative pressure room that helps in preventing cross-contamination and helps control infection.  Track this blog for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak  The hospital has also offered to set up special medical facilities to quarantine travellers from notified countries and suspected cases identified through contact tracing.  RIL has built a fully-equipped isolation facility in Lodhivali, Maharashtra, and handed it over to the district authorities while Reliance Life Sciences is importing additional test kits and consumables for effective testing. The company has also announced an initial support of Rs 5 crore to Maharashtra Chief Minister's Relief Fund.  &amp;quot;RIL is enhancing its production capacities to produce 100,000 face-masks per day and a large number of personal protective equipment (PPEs), such as suits and garments, for the nation&rsquo;s health-workers to equip them further to fight the coronavirus challenge,&amp;quot; it said.  In partnership with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), Reliance Foundation will provide free meals to people across various cities to offer necessary livelihood relief in the current crisis.  On the other hand, RIL's telecom arm, Reliance Jio, has introduced the #CoronaHaaregaIndiaJeetega initiative aimed at enabling Indians &amp;quot;to stay safe while staying connected and productive, allowing for remote working, remote learning, remote engagement and remote care&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Jio is combining its digital capabilities with Microsoft Teams, the unified communication and collaboration hub for teamwork in Office 365, to enable individuals, students, educational and healthcare institutions to continue their professional lives while still practicing social distancing,&amp;quot; the company noted in its statement.  Other initiatives by Jio include a 'Symptom Checker' to enable users to check symptoms at home to prevent unnecessary pressure on the medical system, tools to enable 'Learn From Home&amp;quot; for students and 'Work From Home' for working professionals.  Jio will also provide Basic JioFiber broadband connectivity (10 Mbps), wherever it is geographically feasible, without any service charges, for this period. it will also provide home gateway routers with a minimum refundable deposit. Meanwhile, for all existing JioFiber subscribers, the telco will provide double data across all plans.  Emergency Service vehicles will be able to avail free fuel being offered by Reliance, while all736 grocery stores of Reliance Retail across the country will ensure sufficient supply of essentials, including staples, fruits and vegetables, bread, breakfast cereals and other items of daily use, so that citizens need not stock up.  To ensure that all employees of the company are safe and protected through the ongoing crisis, RIL will continue to pay contract and temporary workers, even if work has halted due to this crisis.  For those earning below Rs 30,000 per month, salaries will be paid twice a month to protect their cash flow and mitigate any overwhelming financial burden. The company has moved most of its employees to its Work-From-Home platform except for those who are manning critical roles in maintaining the Jio network for nearly 40 crore customers and for providing an uninterrupted supply of fuel, grocery and other essential items of daily consumption.

The domestic market witnessed severe selling for the fourth consecutive week, with the benchmark indices losing more than 15 percent.  Nifty closed near the 10,000-mark last week and has now breached the 8,000 level with ease.  At this juncture, it is trading with a cut of around 17 percent, while the Nifty Bank index has lost around 20 percent from the previous week to settle near the 20,000-mark.  At present, the technical supports are not working since the fall has more to do with the overall sentiment.  Earlier, we expected the 9,500&ndash;9,000 zone to attract some buying but that possibility has been ruled out as Nifty has breached the 8,000-mark.  Currently, the index is hovering near 8,000 level, which is the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the entire rally from 6,826 to 12,430.  Further, there is a major hidden divergence in the monthly RSI of the Nifty index, and this will not be negated if 6,825 remains intact during this month.  Also, the momentum oscillators on all the timeframes are showing signs of exhaustion. Thus, the above-mentioned evidence indicates that the range of 8,000&ndash;7000 can be a place where the market is likely to bottom out.  With regard to the intermediate levels, 7,800 followed by 7,500 could be the next supports. On the other hand, in case of any recovery, 8,600 would be the first hurdle above which there could be strong bounce towards the 10,000-mark since the fall also was vertical.  Traders are advised to start picking quality Nifty50 stocks and deploy some of their capital in the range of 8,000&ndash;7,000.  Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:  Reliance Industries (RIL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 917.70 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Stop loss: Rs 760 | Upside: 20%  During the recent fall, Reliance Industries has corrected more than 40 percent from the peak of Rs 1,600 to end near Rs 900 mark.  At present, the stock is approaching its 100-month exponential moving average, which is placed at Rs 800 and the stock has never breached this level convincingly since 1998.  This time, too, we feel that even in the worst-case scenario, Rs 800 could be the zone, which the bulls will try to protect.  Traders are advised to buy the stock on dip from Rs 900 to Rs 840 for the target of Rs 1,100 with a stop loss of Rs 760.  Tata Steel | Buy | CMP: Rs 272 | Target: Rs 330 | Stop loss: Rs 240 | Upside: 21.32%  During the ongoing crash, the Nifty Metal index has been one of the worst performers and has corrected almost 37 percent from a peak of 2,900.  Currently, the index is trading near the lower end of a falling channel, which it has been respecting since January 2018.  Being a high weightage candidate in the Nifty Metal index, Tata Steel also has a similar price structure and is trading very close to the lower end of the falling channel.  In addition, we are witnessing a positive divergence in the weekly and monthly chart of the stock which indicates the possibility of a bounce.  Traders are advised to buy the stock on a dip near Rs 270 for the target of Rs 330 with a stop loss of Rs 240.  Tata Motors | Buy | LTP: Rs 72.90 | Target: Rs 84 | Stop loss: Rs 63 | Upside: 15.22%  Since the beginning of the year, Tata Motors has crashed around 65 percent from its peak of Rs 202 to reach Rs 70-mark.  The stock has been trading in a highly oversold zone for several weeks.  At present, it is hovering near Rs 68 level, which is the potential reversal zone of the bullish AB=CD pattern formed by joining the swing highs and lows of Rs 240, Rs 106 and Rs 202.  The risk-reward ratio looks highly lucrative to go long for short-term traders.  Traders are advised to buy the stock on a dip near Rs 70 for the target of Rs 84 with a stop loss of Rs 63.

Such a step by Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex, and Nayara - part owned by Russian oil major Rosneft - would severely curtail purchases by one of Venezuela's last big export destinations. India accounted for about a third of Venezuela's oil shipments in January.  The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump warned in New Delhi this week of an increase in sanctions in a bid to oust Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.  Washington last year imposed tough sanctions on PDVSA that cut off Venezuela from the United States, its biggest customer, and severely curbed trading with other major buyers of its oil, the nation's main export. Venezuela's once-strong petroleum industry has withered amid a years-long economic crisis.  After several months with little action, the White House this month added Rosneft Trading SA, the Geneva-based unit Rosneft, to its list of sanctioned companies over accusations that it hid the country of origin of oil cargoes loaded at Venezuelan ports and later resold in Asia.  The U.S. set a May 20 deadline for companies to wind down purchases from Rosneft.  Reliance, a long-time customer of PDVSA, has so far not placed requests for April cargoes, one of the sources said.  Nayara Energy, partially owned by Rosneft, is planning to stop processing Venezuelan oil at its refineries after receiving two cargoes that are scheduled for loading in March, two of the sources said.  It will lift no shipments of Venezuelan crude in April &amp;quot;since RTSA (Rosneft Trading SA) was doing all that business and no one else will pick it up,&amp;quot; one of the sources said, given shipping times.  PDVSA and Reliance did not reply to requests for comment. Nayara said it is in compliance with all relevant and applicable U.S. sanctions. &amp;quot;We reaffirm our commitment to this position following the recent announcements&amp;quot;, it said in an email to Reuters. Rosneft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  FRESH SANCTION WORRIES  The caution over shipments comes as the United States steps up its pressure campaign action against PDVSA.  Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and Nayara have major operational and financial exposure in the United States.  Past sanctions have prompted firms, particularly U.S. financial institutions, to overcomply because they are unwilling to risk approving operations linked to PDVSA.  Currently, a small group of oil firms including U.S. major Chevron, Italy's Eni and Spain's Repsol are authorized by the U.S. Treasury Department to take Venezuelan crude as payment for overdue dividends and loans.  Reliance is about to receive about 2.9 million barrels of Venezuelan crude from Chevron and Eni, loaded in January, Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data and PDVSA documents showed.  But using intermediaries for sourcing Venezuelan oil may only be a short-term solution as Washington mulls new sanctions.  U.S. special envoy Elliott Abrams, who has accused oil and shipping firms of transferring Venezuelan oil at sea to disguise its real country of origin, told Reuters this week that firms previously authorized to maintain trade operations with PDVSA could not be allowed to do so anymore.  Rosneft has harshly criticized U.S. sanctions, saying that the oil received does not generate cash for PDVSA - the main purpose of the sanctions - but is paying back loans. It has also accused the Trump administration of discriminatory treatment.  NO LAST MINUTE DEALS  Last year, Reliance and PDVSA agreed to a crude-for-fuel swap that would send 4 million barrels of Venezuelan crude to Reliance monthly in exchange for diesel cargoes, according to sources at PDVSA and India.  PDVSA in February allocated 3.9 million barrels of crude to Reliance in three cargoes bound for Sikka port, and 3.8 million barrels for Nayara through Rosneft Trading. Similar volumes are expected for March, according to PDSVA's export programs, seen by Reuters. However, no oil has been ordered for April, one source said.  At the same time, it would be difficult for Indian refiners to ramp up purchases ahead of the wind-down deadline as incremental purchases could be seen as a new contract by the United States, which is forbidden under the sanctions, one of the industry sources said."

According to the ninth edition of the Hurun Global Rich List 2020, which has a list of 2,817 individuals across the globe having a networth of $1 billion or more, the world has added 480 billionaires in 2019, more than one a day, while China added more than three a week and India did more than three billionaires a month.  However, according to the report, with 799 China is home to more billionaires than the US (626) and India combined and is set to add many more pharma billionaires this year as the communist nation fights a deadly coronavirus epidemic that has already killed more than 2,710 people since mid-January.  There is no surprise that Mumbai is the home to more than a third of the richest individuals in the country with 50 of them living in the megapolis, making it the ninth richest city globally, followed by New Delhi with 30, Bengaluru with 17 and Ahmedabad with 12.  With $67 billion, Ambani is also the ninth richest in the world which is topped by Jeff Bezos of Amazon with $140 billion.

The government had sought USD 3.5 billion in dues from Reliance and Shell-owned BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Ltd based on an October 2016 partial award of an international arbitration tribunal over the recovery of certain costs from the sale of oil and gas produced from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields.  The two firms had gone to the English High Court against the 2016 partial award.  Sources with direct knowledge of the development said the English High Court had previously directed the tribunal to reconsider certain issues. The tribunal subsequently in 2018 issued another award to uphold the two companies right to recover costs.  This award was challenged by the government.  Justice Robin Knowles of the English High Court (EHC) delivered a judgement on February 12 rejecting all of Government of India's five challenges to the 2018 award, sources said.  When contacted, Reliance declined to comment on the issue.  The government had used the 2016 partial award not just to raise a USD 3.5 billion demand on Reliance and Shell but also sought to block Reliance's USD 15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco on grounds that the company owed money to it.  Reliance and Shell had countered the government petition in the Delhi High Court saying ?the petition is an abuse of process as no arbitration award has fixed any final liability of dues on the company. ?  Sources said the Arbitration Tribunal adjudicating disputes under the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) between BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Ltd (Shell) and Reliance with Government of India issued Final Partial Award on October 12, 2016. Parts of the 2016 Award were challenged by the two firms the EHC, and the EHC directed the Arbitration Tribunal to reconsider certain issues.  Arbitration Tribunal reconsidered the issues and on October 1, 2018, gave its Final Partial Award holding that certain costs incurred by two companies were agreed to be cost recoverable by the Government of India.  Government of India challenged the 2018 Award on five issues. The two companies also filed a challenge on one issue that certain costs which Arbitration Tribunal held not be recoverable.  The English court has scheduled a Consequential hearing on February 28, 2020, for issuing further directions in the matter, they said.  Shell and Reliance had previously contended that the tribunal's 2016 award determined certain issues of principles. Pending determination of all issues before it, appropriately, it did not award any monetary sums. Quantification of amounts, if any, by the tribunal is to be done when all issues have been decided.  Certain parts of the 2016 award were challenged by the two companies before an English court wherein it decided some parts of challenge in favour of them and directed the arbitration tribunal to reconsider those parts of the 2016 award. The tribunal, having reconsidered, issued another partial award in December 2018 which was in favour of the two firms.  While this challenge was pending in the English court, the government unilaterally calculated certain amounts, based upon its interpretation of the 2016 award, which the government alleges are payable by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), BG and RIL.  ONGC owns a 40 per cent stake in the fields while Reliance and Shell have 30 per cent each.

The White House imposed sanctions early last year on state-run oil company PDVSA as part of efforts to oust President Nicolas Maduro. The socialist president remains in power despite deep unpopularity and a years-long economic crisis.  Venezuelan exports declined sharply in early 2019, but have since ticked back up to roughly 1 million bpd, as several oil companies resumed marketing or buying the country's oil.  The White House has yet to enforce secondary sanctions announced in August aimed at non-U.S. companies buying Venezuelan oil.  The White House on Wednesday warned several oil companies, including Reliance, Russia's Rosneft , Spain's Repsol and Chevron, to tread cautiously in their activities in Venezuela, in an attempt to ramp up pressure on Maduro.  The suggestion of retaliation surprised those companies, according to executives from joint ventures with state-run PDVSA.  A Reliance spokesperson told Reuters that the refining firm is &amp;quot;in frequent communications with U.S. government officials regarding Venezuela and continuously keep them apprised of our actions.&amp;quot;  Maduro's re-election in 2018 was viewed as a sham by most Western Hemisphere nations. The White House on Wednesday hosted opposition leader Juan Guaido, whom Maduro refers to as a puppet of the United States, even as dozens of nations recognize him as the rightful president.  MORE SANCTIONS PROMISED  On Thursday, Elliot Abrams, the top U.S. envoy for Venezuela, declined to discuss Washington's conversations with Rosneft, but promised more sanctions overall. &amp;quot;We see that sanctions have had and are having significant impact and sanctions will increase,&amp;quot; he said, without elaborating.  Abrams said Moscow may soon find that its support for Maduro &amp;quot;will no longer be cost-free.&amp;quot;  Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday criticized U.S. sanctions policy in a press conference in Mexico City, adding that interference could make things worse in Venezuela. &amp;quot;The U.S. believes it is allowed to do anything and meanwhile threatens interlocutors with punishments and sanctions,&amp;quot; Lavrov said.  Prior to sanctions, Venezuela exported roughly 1.5 million barrels of crude and processed fuels per day. The sanctions cut off Venezuela's top purchaser, the United States.  The White House announced secondary sanctions in August targeting non-U.S. companies buying Venezuelan oil, but its pressure campaign waned in the second half of 2019, and companies interpreted the announcement differently.  COMPANIES NOTE COMPLIANCE  Reliance, among PDVSA's largest customers, in October resumed direct purchases of Venezuelan crude after a four-month pause, helping the state-run company reduce mounting inventories of unsold oil. Reliance said at that time that it was supplying PDVSA with fuel permitted under sanctions in exchange for the Venezuelan oil.  Reliance's representative added that the company does not operate as an intermediary for sales of Venezuelan oil to third parties. &amp;quot;All Venezuelan crude sourced by Reliance is for processing in Reliance's refineries only.&amp;quot;  Chevron resumed marketing of Venezuelan oil in October for the first time since sanctions were imposed, in tankers bound for Asian destinations, according to PDVSA records and Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data.  &amp;quot;We remain focused on our base business operations, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,&amp;quot; said Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, adding that crude marketing is permitted under a license by the U.S. Treasury to pay for expenses related to the maintenance of operations.  Chevron said that shipments of Venezuelan crude taken by the company represented about 2 percent of the country's total exports in 2019. &amp;quot;If Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela, non-U.S. companies will fill the void and oil production will continue,&amp;quot; it added.  Repsol declined to comment. Rosneft and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  China's state-run CNPC suspended loadings of Venezuelan crude at PDVSA's ports last year. It has not resumed them after Washington pressured Chinese energy companies to halt trade with PDVSA.  The U.S. administration has issued waivers for U.S. service firms and some of PDVSA's joint venture partners to continue operating in the South American nation. The permits are not specific about trade transactions with Venezuelan oil.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

The company has investments in US shale gas projects and trades fuel in North America.  US oil sanctions on Venezuela do not ban importing crude oil from the Latin American nation but bar exports from the US of the diluents that must be blended with the extra-heavy oil from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt so it can flow through pipelines.  Industry sources said Reliance had a contract to buy some 3 million barrels of crude oil from Venezuela a month, which was reduced to about 2 million barrels last year.  Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA has been placed on the US Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals list, which generally prohibits American citizens from dealing with named firms or individuals.  This has resulted in international banks and shipping companies as well as Reliance ceasing any transactions with the firm.  These restrictions came into force on March 29, 2019 after an eight week winding down period for contracts that were already in effect.  Oil from the Orinoco Belt needs to be diluted with lighter grades to reduce its viscosity so as to allow its flow through pipelines to the coast for export or processing.

In a late evening statement, Reliance-BP confirmed that it has completed the safe cessation of production in a planned manner from D1/D3 field.  &amp;quot;The RIL-BP joint venture has successfully worked to extend the life of production from the D1/D3 Field which otherwise would have ceased production in 2015 due to issues of reservoir pressure and water ingress.

D1/D3 field, in Block KG D6 (KG-DWN-98/3) located in the Bay of Bengal, was India's first deepwater gas field to be put on production in April 2009.

While at the peak, it was India's biggest gas field, in the last quarter D1/D3 produced an average of just 1.5 mmscmd.  Sources said only three out of the 18 wells drilled on the fields had remained on production and they too died on Monday.  In perhaps one of its kind intervention in a deepsea field, Reliance-BP through use of a combination of complex techniques kept the wells flowing at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields for the last four years.

Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. D1 and D3 fields went onstream in April 2009.  MA field cessation expected by September 2018, the sources said, adding the field at its peak had produced 1,08,418 tonnes of oil in May 2010.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 mmscmd in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.  KG-D6 produced about 3 trillion cubic feet equivalent, saving about USD 30 billion in energy imports.  The sources said the field infrastructure would be utilized to bring on stream the next set of fields in the block.  The joint venture has committed USD 5 billion (Rs 35,000 crores) of investments towards monetizing another 3 trillion cubic feet equivalent (about 500 Million Barrels of Oil equivalent) reserves from three projects - R cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields.  These projects will be utilizing most of the existing gas production facilities, they said, adding once commissioned, the three fields will deliver a peak production of 1 billion cubic feet per day, which is about 20 per cent of the current domestic production.  Although there were initial setbacks due to geological surprises, the challenge was to extend life of the field beyond 2015 due to lower reservoir pressure and water ingress, the sources said.  Reliance-BP innovated and applied first of their kind solutions to extend field life and maximize recovery, which included sidetrack/substitute wells, reduction of arrival pressures, and mitigating the effect of water in the network.  This effort extended production up till this month.  The sources said despite best efforts, in recent times the field instability exacerbated due to water and sand ingress leading to a sharp decline in production. Consequently, to preserve the facilities for future use, the field had to be safely shutdown on Monday.  The field set several global benchmarks set in terms of deepwater operational performance - 99.9 per cent uptime, 100 per cent incident-free operations and no security incident.  Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 66.6 per cent stake, while BP has the balance.

India, which uses about 14 million tonnes of plastic annually, lacks an organised system for management of plastic waste, leading to widespread littering.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi is urging India to end consumption of single-use plastics by 2022.  But Indians should focus on fighting pollution, not plastics, executives at Reliance, whose chairman is Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, said during a launch event on Tuesday.  The company will seek to work with India's highway authority and individual states to potentially supply a plastics-infused mix to make some of the thousands of kilometres of roads Modi wants to build to upgrade India's creaking infrastructure.  Light plastics, the type used as carry bags or snack wrappers, are typically not viable to recycle and so end up in landfills, street corners or oceans. Reliance wants to shred these plastics and mix them with bitumen, a formula the conglomerate says is cheaper and longer-lasting.  &amp;quot;(This) can be a game-changing project both for our environment and our roads,&amp;quot; Vipul Shah, the COO of the petrochemicals business, said at a company petchem plant in the western state of Maharashtra.  Shah was coy on details, saying Reliance had yet to work out the financial fine print in what he stressed would be a philanthropic endeavour.  Reliance's announcement comes as campaigners such as Greta Thunberg ramp up pressure on businesses to help tackle climate change.  &amp;quot;It is happening internationally and now has started percolating to India too, though it's at a very early stage,&amp;quot; said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.  &amp;quot;Corporates and industries are a big source of all kinds of pollution in India, so much more serious thoughts, policies and actions are required from them,&amp;quot; he added.  India was home to 15 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world in 2018, according to a study by two groups monitoring air pollution. New Delhi is the world's most polluted capital, with smog causing school cancellations, flight diversions and untold health problems for its over 20 million people.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

For the oil-to-telecom conglomerate, energy remains core business and is expected to further expand as India is forecast to be the fastest-growing market for fuel and chemical products over the next decade, it said adding the company's partnership with BP of the UK and Saudi Aramco will support this.  Reliance owns the world's largest single-site oil refining complex and has multiple petrochemical plants. Three years back it forayed into telecom business and has reached 34 per cent share of market revenue.  &amp;quot;Based on the current net add run-rates it will likely reach 44 per cent share by the end of the next financial year,&amp;quot; Bernstein said.  On its retail foray, it said Reliance is the offline leader with $18.5 billion of revenues coming from 11,000-plus stores. &amp;quot;The company is best positioned in New Commerce - digitizing the neighbourhood stores and in e-commerce (grocery/fashion categories).&amp;quot;  Also, fintech is another area in which Reliance is well positioned, it said identifying digitizing the kirana stores to accept digital payments and distributing mutual funds through Jio Money (payment app) as business opportunities.  Stating that media offers unique opportunities and synergies with telco, the analyst said Reliance has the dominant OTT platforms in India with content partnerships with Disney and Viacom.  &amp;quot;With activities spanning oil and gas, telecoms, retail media and fintech, Reliance is one of the most diversified conglomerates in India if not the world. There is simply no other company like it,&amp;quot; Bernstein said. &amp;quot;In India, Reliance dominates energy, telco and retail in the same way that Exxon, AT&amp;amp;amp;T and Amazon does in the US. But rather than three separate companies, Reliance comprises all three of these businesses rolled into one.&amp;quot;  While Exxon is the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas company, AT&amp;amp;amp;T is the world's largest telecommunications firm. Amazon is the world's largest online retailer.  Bernstein said Reliance has been unique in terms of entering new business areas and managing to achieve what the incumbent players and investors would never have thought possible. &amp;quot;This is a testament to Reliance management skills and ability to navigate some of the complexities which come with being a large operator in India.&amp;quot;  While there have some failures, notably oil and gas production along the way, &amp;quot;what has impressed most is the strategic vision and execution ability of Reliance management to enter and 'win' in areas outside of core business,&amp;quot; it said.  Over the past 10 years Reliance has undergone a transformation, which is almost unprecedented in corporate history, it said.  A decade ago 100 per cent of the EBITDA from the business came from energy-related business segments (refining, petrochemicals and E&amp;amp;amp;P). This year FY20, the contribution from energy will fall to 64 per cent. &amp;quot;In two years (FY22), we expect that energy will fall below 50 per cent of the group EBITDA and by FY25, the energy-related business will account for around 30 per cent of group EBITDA,&amp;quot; it said adding by FY23 telco will overtake energy to be the largest EBITDA contributing segment.  As Ambani embraced the new economy, Reliance sold out of the old economy - 30 per cent of upstream to BP in 2011 and an initial agreement with Aramco in 2019 for 20 per cent of the refining and petrochemical business).  The company, it said, could be a case study for other oil majors on how to evolve their business to compete in the low carbon world.

While having an overweight call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,753, Morgan Stanley said earnings were 6 percent above its estimate, mainly due to lower tax rate.  &amp;quot;Better refinery utilisation rates were offset high telecom subscriber churn. Retail &amp;amp;amp; chemical businesses had in-line margin trends,&amp;quot; it added.  Credit Suisse, the only brokerage having neutral call with a target at Rs 1,400, said Jio reported lower-than_expected result on ARPU, subscribers &amp;amp;amp; margins, but Jio will become net recipient of access charges from Q4FY20.  Strong margin improvement in retail was due to better mix. Gross refining margin declined QoQ due to lower middle distillate crack and the outlook on refining margin depends on pick-up in demand for marine gas oil, the brokerage said.

It was also supported by lower tax cost and higher other income.  The poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18 had estimated profit at Rs 11,333 crore for the quarter.  Consolidated revenue from operations in Q3 rose 2.5 percent QoQ to Rs 1.57 lakh crore, but the same fell 2.5 percent YoY.  &amp;quot;Decrease in revenue YoY is primarily on account of 10.6 percent decline in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business revenues, with lower product price realization and 6.6 percent fall in Brent crude price. This was partially offset by continuing growth momentum in consumer businesses,&amp;quot; the company said in its BSE filing.  Gross refining margin (GRM) for the quarter came in at $9.2 a barrel, which was in line with the poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18, against $8.8 a barrel in Q3FY19 and $9.4 a barrel in Q2FY20.  Refining margins weakened QoQ on the back of steep declines in fuel oil cracks from the upcoming IMO spec change and lower-middle distillate cracks more than offsetting the gains in light distillate cracks, company said.  RIL maintained significant premium over Singapore complex margins with product yield optimization to take advantage of firm middle distillate cracks and robust risk management, it added.

Refining business grew by 6.7 percent sequentially (down 7.2 percent YoY) to Rs 1.03 lakh crore, but petrochemical segment reported a 4.2 percent decline QoQ (down 19.1 percent YoY) at Rs 36,909 crore for the quarter due to lower price realizations across product categories.  &amp;quot;The third-quarter results for our energy business reflects the weak global economic environment and volatility in energy markets. Within our O2C chain, downstream petrochemicals profitability was impacted by weak margins across products with subdued demand in well-supplied markets,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  &amp;quot;Refining segment performance improved in a difficult operating environment given our continuous focus on cost positions, high operating rates and product placement,&amp;quot; he added.  Refining segment's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) grew by 14.1 percent quarter-on-quarter (up 11.9 percent YoY) to Rs 5,657 crore and margin increased 40bps QoQ and 100bps YoY to 5.5 percent for Q3FY20.  On the petchem front, EBIT fell sharply by 22.7 percent QoQ (down 28.5 percent YoY) to Rs 5,880 crore and margin contracted to 15.9 percent (from 19.7 percent in Q2FY20 and 18 percent in Q3FY19).  Reliance Jio, the country's largest company by market share and subscriber base, reported a whopping 36.4 percent sequential growth in Q3 profit at Rs 1,350 crore on revenue of Rs 13,968 crore, which grew 6.4 percent QoQ.  The profitability of telecom operator was lower than the poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18 (which was pegged at Rs 1,500 crore). It was impacted by Rs 177 crore on account of AGR dues.  At the operating level, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 8.4 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 5,601 crore and margin expanded by 80bps to 40.1 percent in Q3FY20.  Jio's average revenue per user (ARPU) for the quarter stood at Rs 128.4, higher by 7 percent over Rs 120 in September quarter. It was also ahead of analyst estimates of Rs 124-125.  The telecom operator added 14.8 million subscribers during the quarter against 23.9 million users addition seen in previous quarter, taking its total subscriber base to 370 million at the end of December quarter.  Reliance Retail continued to report stellar growth for the quarter as revenue grew by 27.4 percent YoY (up 10 percent QoQ) to Rs 45,327 crore with accelerated store roll-out and strong LFL sales.  &amp;quot;Revenue growth was led by robust 35.7 percent YoY growth in consumer electronics, fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle and grocery segments,&amp;quot; the company said.  &amp;quot;The company saw consistent same-store sales growth and record footfall across our stores driven by our compelling proposition of great shopping experience and superior value,&amp;quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  Retail's EBIT at Rs 2,389 crore showed a massive 58 percent YoY growth (up 17.4 percent QoQ) and margin grew by 110bps YoY (up 40bps QoQ) to 5.3 percent for the quarter ended December 2019.  Consolidated EBITDA during the quarter increased 1.1 percent to Rs 22,386 crore QoQ and margin contracted 20bps QoQ to 14.6 percent in Q3FY20, but both were ahead of CNBC-TV18 poll which was pegged at Rs 22,313 crore and 14 percent respectively.  Mukesh Ambani said the company was making good progress on the value unlocking initiatives announced earlier while building on sustainable growth platforms for shareholders.  Outstanding debt of the company was Rs 3,06,851 crore at the end of December 2019, compared to Rs 2,87,505 crore as on March 31, 2019.  RIL stock has risen 13.6 percent during the third quarter and has rallied 36 percent in the last year amid asset monetisation news and strong growth in the telecom business.

Overall, consolidated revenue for the quarter could be higher by 2-7 percent sequentially, but profit and operating income may be flat to moderately high as strong telecom and retail segments could be offset by weaker petchem business.  Brokerages expect Q3 gross refining margins (GRM), which are closely watched by the Street, at around $9-10 per barrel against $9.4 a barrel reported in the September quarter, which may support standalone earnings but could be offset by weak petchem margin.  Motilal Oswal expects GRM at around $9 a barrel, with a huge premium of $7.3 a barrel to Singapore GRM, while Kotak Institutional Equities expects the GRM at $10.5 a barrel on the higher side for the quarter.  Singapore GRM averaged at around $1.6-1.7 per barrel for Q3FY19, primarily due to worsening of FO (fuel oil) cracks and failure in revival of diesel cracks. This is the lowest quarterly GRM average in the last 15 years.  For All Earnings Related News - Click Here  In Q3FY20, average Brent prices stood at $62.5 per barrel, marginally higher than the average price of $61.9 a barrel in Q2FY20, resulting in inventory gains for refiners based on their different inventory cycles, Motilal Oswal said.  Kotak Institutional Equities expect standalone EBITDA to increase QoQ led by higher refining margins at $10.5 a barrel and crude throughput, which will be partly offset by sharp moderation in overall petchem margins.  But all eyes will remain on consumer businesses - telecom and retail - as CMD, Mukesh Ambani in the last annual general meeting had said these segments would be key drivers in coming years.  The tariff hike since December and consistent addition of subscribers are expected to support Jio, which could report higher average revenue per user (ARPU) while retail business could continue to surprise with growth.  &amp;quot;Consolidated EBITDA will be further boosted by increase in contribution from (1) Jio (up Rs 900 crore QoQ) amid rising subscriber base and higher ARPUs and (2) retail segment amid sustained growth in revenues,&amp;quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities.  &amp;quot;In the wake of Reliance Jio's discounted offering of Jiophone at a cut-throat Rs 699, we are building in a flat subscriber base for Bharti and a 5.7 million decline in subscriber base for Idea. We expect Jio's revenue to jump 12.6 percent QoQ bolstered by higher Jiophone sales, recovery of IUC charges and price hikes,&amp;quot; said Edelweiss.  The brokerage expects Jio to add 30 million subscribers during the quarter, and a 2.6 percent jump in ARPUs.  For Reliance Retail, the management expects to sustain same-store-sales growth at around 20 percent in FY20. It is currently present in over 7,000 cities and towns.  Key things to watch out for would be commentary on number of subscriber addition due to impact of ARPU changes, closure of Aramco deal as a part of debt reduction strategy and IPO plans for retail business.  The stock gained 13.6 percent during third quarter and rallied 36 percent in last one year amid asset monetisation news and strong growth in telecom business.

Reliance Retail's shareholders have will get one share of its listed parent, Reliance Industries, in exchange for every four shares, according to the scheme of arrangement posted on Reliance Retail's website.  The share-swap values Reliance Retail at about Rs 2.4 lakh crore.  Reliance Retail is an unlisted subsidiary of Reliance Retail Ventures and an indirect subsidiary of oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).  RIL's shares ended at Rs 1,515.95 apiece on the BSE, giving the company a market cap of Rs 9.6 lakh crore.

In a counter affidavit, Reliance said it was a &amp;quot;falsehood&amp;quot; to say that the arbitration tribunal had passed an award requiring the company and its partners to pay $3.5 billion to the government.  It said the petition is an abuse of process as &amp;quot;it portrays that a sum of money is due and payable under the final award and purports to compute the money payable on a basis neither found in the arbitration award nor disclosed in the petition.&amp;quot;  The government, it said, has calculated on its own volition the revised figure of its share of profit from oil and gas production allegedly due by extrapolating the purported finds.  The affidavit came in response to the government moving the Delhi High Court seeking to block Reliance selling 20 per cent stake in its oil and chemical business to Saudi Aramco for $15 billion, in view of pending dues of $3.5 billion in Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields.  An international arbitration tribunal issued a partial award in October 2016 in the dispute between the Government of India (GoI), BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Limited (BG) and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) regarding the Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts (PSC).  The tribunal in its 2016 award determined certain issues of principles. Pending determination of all issues before it, appropriately, it did not award any monetary sums. Quantification of amounts, if any, by the tribunal is to be done when all issues have been decided.  Certain parts of the 2016 award were challenged by BG/RIL before an English court wherein it decided some parts of challenge in favour of BG/RIL and directed the arbitration tribunal to reconsider those parts of the 2016 award. The tribunal, having reconsidered, issued another partial award in December 2018 which was in favour of BG/RIL.  While this challenge was pending in the English court, GoI unilaterally calculated certain amounts, based upon its interpretation of the 2016 award, which the government alleges are payable by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), BG and RIL.  Reliance said pursuant to the 2018 award, GoI's claim comes down very significantly -- a fact which the government has not taken cognisance of and approached the Delhi High Court prematurely for enforcement of its claim computed based on its interpretation of the 2016 award.  RIL maintained that except as quantified by the tribunal, no amount can be said to be payable at this stage.  GoI has challenged the 2018 award and the English court is yet to pronounce its judgment.  One of the most significant issues pending before the tribunal is an increase in the Cost Recovery Limit under the PSC. The arbitration tribunal is scheduled to hear BG/RIL's application for increase of PSC Cost Recovery Limit next year.  If the tribunal decides in favour of BG/RIL, then GoI's computation of sums allegedly payable by ONGC, BG and RIL is expected to further come down.  Final amounts payable, if any, by the parties (ONGC 40 per cent, BG 30 per cent and RIL 30 per cent) can only be determined by the arbitration tribunal in the quantification phase of the arbitration which will be scheduled after it has decided on all the issues before it, it said.  ONGC, who was directed by GoI in 2011 not to participate in the arbitration proceedings but be bound by the award, wrote to the stock exchanges in May 2018 that the government's demand is premature.  The 2016 award, in part superseded by the 2018 award, cannot be said to have attained finality and attempts to enforce the 2016 award are premature, RIL said.

In 2019, the average monthly production from the fields was around 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 140 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day.  Speaking on the development, Trivikram Arun, Managing Director, BGEPIL said, &amp;quot;The PMT JV is a great example of a successful partnership between India's largest national oil company (ONGC), India's largest private company (Reliance) and an international oil company (Shell).&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Our teams have worked relentlessly to ensure a safe handover of the producing fields from the PMT JV to ONGC at the end of the term,&amp;quot; he said.  B Ganguly, President-E&amp;amp;amp;P, Reliance said, &amp;quot;At their peak, Panna-Mukta have contributed to nearly 6 per cent of India's oil production and almost 7 per cent of India's gas production in the year 2007-08. Reliance has been a part of this journey and contributed, by providing energy, to the growth and development of India's oil and gas sector.&amp;quot;  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

This follows the initial heads of agreement signed in August this year,&amp;quot; a statement said.  The venture is expected to be formed during the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.  RIL currently has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 30-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These will be taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and grown in future.  RIL will hold 51 per cent in the new joint venture company while BP will have the remaining 49 per cent. This will assume ownership of RIL's existing Indian fuel retail network and access its aviation fuel business.  In August, RIL had said BP will pay about Rs 7,000 crore for acquiring a 49 per cent stake in its existing petrol pumps and aviation turbine fuel network.  This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought 30 per cent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India.  The country currently has 66,408 petrol pumps, with public sector retailers owning 59,831. PSU retailers have plans to double this network and have already starting appointing dealers.  Russia's Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, formerly Essar Oil, has 5,453 petrol pumps and has plans to scale them up to more than 7,000 in two-three years.  Royal Dutch Shell has 167 outlets and is slated to add 150-200 more petrol pumps.  BP had in 2016 received a licence from the government to set up 3,500 petrol pumps in India but it didn't move on that authorisation.  French energy giant Total SA too is keen on entering the Indian retail market and has tied up with Adani Group for the same.  &amp;quot;The new venture, further development of RIL and BP's longstanding partnership, will include an India-wide fuels retail service station network and aviation fuel marketing business. Building from RIL's existing businesses, the partners expect the venture to co-create a world-class fuels partnership to grow rapidly and help meet India's fast-growing demands for energy and mobility,&amp;quot; the statement issued on Monday said.  The partnership, it said, will expand the fuel and ATF network to up to 5,500 petrol pumps and 45 aviation fuel stations over the next five years.  &amp;quot;The retail network will operate under the Jio-BP brand, signalling a new paradigm shift in fuels marketing and mobility solutions. It brings together Reliance's extensive access and connection to consumers through its Jio digital platform and BP's deep experience in fuel retailing around the world. The joint venture will seek to offer Indian consumers high-quality differentiated fuels, convenience and services,&amp;quot; the statement said.  BP's Castrol lubricants will also be available across the venture's network.  The agreement was signed in Mumbai by Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of RIL and Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive of BP.  Ambani said: &amp;quot;I am delighted that BP and Reliance are further building on their strong partnership. BP and Reliance are combining their knowledge, expertise and experience to provide Indian consumers world-class products and services. We believe that together we will bring solutions that will benefit the fast-growing Indian market.&amp;quot;  Bob Dudley said: &amp;quot;India is one of the world's most important energy markets &ndash; its transport and aviation sectors are growing and evolving rapidly. We aim to meet the country's growing demand for mobility solutions, high-quality fuels and services through this new venture. This major expansion of our business here reinforces our long-term commitment to India.&amp;quot;  Disclaimer:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

Reliance's consumer-facing businesses like telecom and organised retail have helped it become India's largest company, ending the decade-long reign of IOC.  Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries posted a 41.5 percent growth in FY19 revenue to Rs 5.81 lakh crore, 8.4 percent higher than IOC's Rs 5.36 lakh crore revenue for the year. RIL's FY19 profit at Rs 39,588 crore, was also more than double that of IOC.  &amp;quot;Over the past 10 years, the oil-to-retail conglomerate's profit has been an average three times higher than that of IOC. The highest it touched compared to IOC was up to 4.8 times, in FY15 when RIL's profit was Rs 23,566 crore and the public sector major's stood at Rs 4,912 crore,&amp;quot; it said.  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), State Bank of India, Tata Motors and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL)&nbsp;followed IOC with no changes in their ranking between 2018 and 2019.  The ranking does not include subsidiaries. So, ONGC's ranking does not reflect those from its recently-acquired Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) as well as ONGC Videsh.  Rajesh Exports bagged&nbsp;the seventh rank on the 2019 list, jumping one position.

Overall, the revenue of the Fortune India 500 companies in the 2019 list grew 9.53 percent, while profit rose 11.8 percent.  A total of 57 companies dropped off the list for reasons including consolidation within the public sector banks, public sector undertakings, as well as the private sector.  This year, the total loss posted by the 500 companies also came down, with 65 companies posting a cumulative loss of Rs 1.67 lakh crore, compared to last year's Rs 2 lakh crore racked up by 79 companies, Fortune India said.  Public and private sector banks faced diverse fortunes in 2019. As many as 14 of 22 public sector banks reported cumulative losses of Rs 74,253 crore. In contrast, just two private sector banks posted losses (IDFC First Bank, at Rs 1,907.9 crore; and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, at Rs 894.1 crore). The total profit of 24 of private sector banks (including foreign banks and cooperative banks) was Rs 60,747 crore, a 6.16 percent increase over 2017-18.  Fortune India said the oil and gas sector (with eight companies) accounted for 22.3 percent of the total revenue of the 500 companies, followed by banking with 15.88 percent of the total.  The banking sector, with 48 companies, is also the biggest contributor by way of the number of companies on the list. Oil and gas, however, has the highest share of profit in the 500, at 23.44 percent.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;  With inputs from PTI"

We have selected Reliance Industries&nbsp;from the pack. After hitting the fresh all-time high, stock has formed a base and appearing to be ready for fresh up move again. Hence, we would recommend the delta appreciating based &ldquo;Bull Call Spread&rdquo; in the counter.  As we have appropriate time left for the expiry, it will be prudent to go for Delta Based strategy to capture the up move.  Option Chain Analysis  The initial signal of an up move has been witnessed in the option chain, as Call option of 1,580 strike price has lost 236,000 contracts in open interest which suggest that bears are on the back foot. On the other hand, bulls have shown confidence and fresh writing of 71,500 contracts has been witnessed in 1580 strike price Put option.  The last concern for the bulls is now at 1,600 level, where maximum outstanding Open Interest (OI) is placed on the Call side and traders can expect sharp move in the counter once the level is taken out on higher side.  Stock seems to be ready for the rally till 1,640 level, which is a probable target as per option chain. 1,640 CE holds approximately 9 lakh contracts on short side and likely to be an appropriate profit booking point for the bulls.  Technical and Market Structure  The overall technical structure is quite bullish after hitting fresh all-time high and the stock has consolidated at near its 20-Day Moving average. Now, the sign of revival is appearing again and stock is falling in the category of reversal after retracement.  After the convergence, the short term moving averages are again opening up and moving upwards. RSI is bouncing back from the important support levels and trading in a bullish zone.  Apart from this, 38.2 percent retracement move is also respected in the counter as per Fibonacci theory. Traders can expect the fresh all-time highs in the counter in days to come and project the immediate target of Rs 1,640.  Apart from the technical structure, the overall sentiments are also bullish in the stock. We have witnessed many broking houses have put the stock in &ldquo;outperforming&rdquo; category and raised their price targets.  Strategy  Looking at the overall structure, we believe traders can opt for &ldquo;Bull Call Spread&rdquo; where In the Money call option can be bought and to hedge positions Out Of the Money call option can be sold. As delta of OTM CE is almost half in comparison to ITM CE, the appreciation in ITM option premium will be almost double.  BUY 1580 CE AT 35 (DELTA - 0.53) SELL 1640 CE 12.45 (DELTA - 0.25) MAXIMUM PROFIT - 37.45 MAXIMUM LOSS - 22.55  &amp;amp;nbsp;  The author is CFA at Rudra Shares &amp;amp;amp; Stock Brokers  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

Over the past decade, RIL's post-tax ROCE (return on capital employed) has been range-bound around 7-8 per cent. &amp;quot;We think this trend is set to be reversed as the telecom tariff increase should raise returns on $50 billion of investments (50 per cent of the last capital expenditure cycle).&amp;quot;  Last week, top-three mobile operators Bharti Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea increased prepaid tariffs by 14-33 per cent.  &amp;quot;We see ROCE rising to 11 per cent in two years as consumer portfolio returns inch closer to energy ROCE of around 14 per cent,&amp;quot; it said adding although overall returns are still below levels since 2004, an uplift in the chemical cycle from current troughs should boost ROCE higher.  Reliance Jio, the telecom arm of RIL, last week raised tariff by up to 39 per cent following hikes effected by other service providers. The hike will boost revenue over the next four quarters as the revamped plans will restrict down-trading-led revenue leakage.  Edelweiss in a separate report said while the industry's average revenue per user (ARPU) has plunged 33 per cent over the past four years, voice usage per customer has jumped 84 per cent and data usage by 47-times providing enough value to customers to justify the tariff hike.  &amp;quot;We expect industry ARPUs to improve over Q4FY20-Q3FY21 led by users optimising spends by advancing recharges as well as consolidating SIMs,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Moreover, users are likely to delay recharges as well as down-trades, especially in the voice segment.&amp;quot;  However, the new tariff plans are still affordable and the hikes are expected to drive 35 per cent ARPU improvement in four quarters for Jio, it said. &amp;quot;With Reliance Jio plans being 20 per cent cheaper than rivals, we expect the company's robust subscriber addition pace to sustain. Hence, we revise up Jio's FY21 subscriber estimate 17 per cent to 471 million.&amp;quot;  Centrum said Jio has seen the highest increase in tariffs in the 56-84 days' validity plans which have risen by 33-35 per cent, while the lowest increase was seen in the 2GB/day plans for 28 days (12.2 per cent).  &amp;quot;Given that there is some portion of subscribers who may down trade to lower-priced plans and some subscribers may have taken longer prepaid plans in advance, we estimate an 8 per cent increment in ARPU for FY21 and a further 19 per cent in FY22E for Jio,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Resultant, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) for Jio sees an upgrade of 16/20 per cent from previous estimates.&amp;quot;  Jio plans, it said, remain the most attractive on the street. &amp;quot;Despite the material uptick in the tariff plans, Jio's plans across price points remain the cheapest on the street, with a discount of 8-20 per cent vs Airtel/ Voda-Idea plans.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;With the superior data speeds and network coverage for Jio, we believe its dominant position in terms of market share growth and data usage will sustain comfortably over the next 18-24 months post this change,&amp;quot; it said.  Morgan Stanley said RIL's chemical Ebitda will decline a 20 per cent quarter-on-quarter in October-December, leading to overall earnings to remain muted despite better refining margin.  However, the trough is unlikely to be sustained as supply rationalisation and normalisation in inventory should help margins, it said.

The signing of the agreement in Abu Dhabi was witnessed by UAE Minister and ADNOC Group CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber and RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh D Ambani.  The agreement was signed by Abdulaziz Alhajri, Executive Director of ADNOC's Downstream Directorate, and Nikhil R Meswani, RIL Executive Director.  Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used primarily for the production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), which is used mainly in the polymerization manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  PVC is commonly used in pipes, ?ttings, pro?les, tubes, windows, doors, sidings, wire, cable, ?lm, sheet, and ?ooring.  The vinyls industries include construction and infrastructure, agriculture, electrical products and healthcare. EDC is also used as an intermediate in the manufacture of chlorinated solvents and ethyleneamines, and as a solvent in the textile, metal cleaning, and adhesive industries.  The US is the largest producer and consumer of EDC in the world, accounting for approximately 30 per cent of global capacity, production, and consumption in 2018. The US is also the largest EDC exporter, representing about 43 per cent of global exports, as a result of advantaged production economics and healthy demand for caustic soda.  The Indian subcontinent is expected to be the fastest-growing region for EDC demand, with a projected increase of about 17 per cent per year.  &amp;quot;ADNOC would supply ethylene to the potential joint venture and provide access to world-class infrastructure at Ruwais, while RIL will deliver operational expertise and entry to the large and growing Indian vinyls market, in which it is a key participant,&amp;quot; the statement said.  Meswani said: &amp;quot;This is a significant step towards Reliance's commitment to pursue backward integration and will pave the way for enhancing PVC capacity in India to cater to the fast growing domestic market. This co-operation ideally combines advantaged feedstock and energy from the UAE with Reliance's execution capabilities and the growing Indian market.&amp;quot;  Alhajri said: &amp;quot;The agreement with Reliance Industries Limited is a product of our strong relationship, spanning over two decades, and a testament to ADNOC's continued ability to cultivate smart and mutually beneficial international partnerships. We look forward to working closely with RIL to identify opportunities to capitalize on the strengths of the Ruwais ecosystem, while delivering a compelling new commercial platform for satisfying the large Indian PVC market, as well as demand for other fast-growing segments in the region.

Sharing further details on where this opportunity lies, he said, &ldquo; For the entire B group and the smallcap (excluding the A group), the marketcap at this point of time is Rs 9.2 lakh crore and the marketcap of Reliance Industries &nbsp;(RIL) alone is Rs 9.9 lakh crore. So it clearly shows that we have a problem somewhere. Markets are totally disconnected from realities.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Therefore, it is impossible to believe that 8,000-9,000 or 5,000 companies, all doing business in the same country total up to a marketcap of Rs 9.2 lakh crore versus one company on one side, which is Rs 9.9 lakh crore. So it shows that there is phenomenal opportunity in the market,&amp;quot; he said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.  According to him, the big theme over the next two years is going to be public sector enterprises. PSUs have been beaten down to nothing but it is matter of time before they will get re-rated. There is immense value there, he said.  When asked about the auto space, he said, &ldquo;The feedback that I get from the channels is that the excess inventory has been pushed out, it has come down substantially but one cannot say that demand is going to come up and things are going to be gung-ho from next month onwards.&amp;quot; It is possible that there are early green-shoots but would still prefer to wait a month or two or maybe a quarter to see auto stabilising, he added.  &amp;quot;The early signs are there, so for people who want to take a risk, be bold and catch it early, maybe they could take a call. I won&rsquo;t be surprised if the numbers are down next month again,&rdquo; said Dutt.  According to him, one can find opportunities across the sectors &ndash; there are good quality companies in consumption, in pharmaceuticals, in infrastructure construction, banking and financial services.  On telecom space, he said, &ldquo;Reliance standalone is an excellent company, excellent investment but till one doesn&rsquo;t get clarity on how to take a telecom exposure on Reliance, I think the only option left is Bharti Airtel right now or for some real brave people there is Vodafone and&nbsp;I am one of those.&amp;quot;  On the financial side, he is not upbeat on Yes Bank, he said.  When asked about the possibility of the goods and services tax (GST) rates going up, Dutt said, &ldquo;The fact is that when the corporate tax rates went down, we rallied for two days and we forgot about it. We never realised that that was the seminal change that happened in Indian macro and corporate history but the market forgot about it and we moved on. Yes, economy has a problem, we do have a problem, GST rate tinkering happens, go up 2 percent here, 3 percent there but is that going to change consumption anywhere? It is not. It is going to change for about a month or two or three months, we will absorb it and move on. I am not going re-balance my portfolio based on GST rates but would look at much deeper fundamentals and other important issues that are going to reflect on my portfolio for the next two-ten years.&rdquo;  &ldquo;My view is going to change when I see some fundamental shifts happening. If the GST rates goes up 2 percent on something, goes down on something, it is not going to impact me in my portfolio as such. It will have a short-term impact,&amp;quot; he said, adding that fundamentally, if we have a problem in the economy, we need to sort that out.  &amp;quot;More than the economy, we have a problem in the financial system today. The single-most problem that we are all living with is trust issue. There is no trust in the financial system. Till that is not restored, no amount of work can be done,&rdquo; he further mentioned.

On the strength of RIL&rsquo;s existing and new growth engines, the company is confident of growing this by 15% annually over the next 5 years.  RIL and Saudi Aramco have agreed to a non-binding letter of intent (LOI), wherein the latter may acquire a 20&nbsp;percent stake in the &lsquo;oil-to-chemicals&rsquo; division at an enterprise value of USD 75 billion.  RIL have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in their consumer businesses, Jio and Reliance Retail. The company will induct leading global partners in these businesses in the next few quarters, and move towards listing of both these companies within the next five years which will result in significant value unlocking.  With the investment cycle likely having peaked, we expect RoI trajectory to improve going forward.

The objective is to make the digital platform holding company along with Reliance Jio (RJio) debt free that will pave the way for attracting strategic investors and financial investors in the digital business at a premium valuation.  What all is included?  The group has created a very strong digital ecosystem through RJio, which has become the second-largest single country service provider with more than 355 million subscribers. The new subsidiary would include Reliance Jio and its platforms viz: MyJio, JioTV, JioCinema, JioNews and JioSaavan and all other emerging digital platforms in the areas of education, health etc.  The objective  After the completion of RJio&rsquo;s major capital expenditure, the group demerged its tower and fibre passive infrastructure assets to make RJio asset light. However, RJio still has a balance sheet of Rs 2,37,000 crore post the demerger.  The primary objective of creating the aforesaid WOS is to make RJio debt free through the rights issue of optionally convertible preference shares (OCPS) aggregating up to Rs 1,08,000 crore to the WOS. This OCPS issuance by RJio to WOS is towards payment for transfer of identified liabilities of this amount to RIL (100&nbsp;percent owner of WOS).  As part of this arrangement, the WOS will also take over RIL&rsquo;s ownership of Rs 65,000 crore equity in RJIL. Effectively, WOS would hold an interest amounting to Rs 1,73,000 crore in RJIL. Post this, RJIL would become virtually debt-free by the end of FY20 , with the exception of spectrum related liabilities.  Benefits?  The structure need not involve a&nbsp;complete&nbsp;cash outgo at this point in time. However, it can be expected to be in alignment with the redemption profile of the identified liabilities being transferred to RIL.  The most important objective of undertaking this structuring is to bring all the digital businesses under one umbrella.  All digital initiatives of cutting-edge technologies, collaborations&nbsp;and partnerships will happen on this platform.  Through the reorganisation of the capital structure, the equity base of this digital platform gets expanded from Rs 65,000 crore to Rs 1,73,000 crore, entirely held by RIL through its WOS.&nbsp;This will create capacity to onboard strategic / financial investors at a future date.  The digital platform will be debt free.  The coming together of all the digital businesses will make this company the first port of call for any overseas entity looking to harness Indian digital growth opportunities.  Hence, in future getting a financial and/or strategic investor for the digital business at a very good valuation is highly probable.

The board of RIL October 25 approved&nbsp;the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary&nbsp;for its digital&nbsp;businesses and the infusion of&nbsp;Rs 1.08 lakh crore in it.  The deal&nbsp;will make&nbsp;RJIL a net-debt free company by March 31, 2020.  This is because the board of RJIL approved a&nbsp;scheme of arrangement between the company and certain classes of its creditors, including debenture holders, that will transfer identified liabilities of up to Rs 1.08 lakh crore to RIL.  Consequently, the newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary will subscribe&nbsp;to a rights issue of Optionally Convertible Preference Shares (OCPS) aggregating up to the same amount - Rs 1.08 lakh crore.  After the transaction, RJIL will become virtually net debt-free company by the end of this fiscal. Only&nbsp;the spectrum-related liabilities will remain.  The latest move comes after RJIL's core digital connectivity platform, tower and fiber passive infrastructure assets of approximately Rs 1.25 lakh crore were demerged in March 2019, to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs).  Following this demerger, RJIL became asset-light having a balance sheet size of Rs 2.37&nbsp;lakh&nbsp;crore.  The twin restructuring exercise now gives the 4G-based telecom operator, which has&nbsp;35.5 crore subscribers, enough room to expand and possibly boost its 5G ambitions.  And also, this helps it open gates to more investors. Already, after the March move, the company got an investor in the form of&nbsp;Brookfield Asset Management, which agreed to acquire the tower business through an infusion of Rs 25,215 crore.  More such announcements can now be expected.  The digital push, now with the newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, will add teeth to RJIL's offering.

After the Q2 numbers were released, global financial firm HSBC maintained a buy recommendation on the stock, raising the target price to Rs 1,565 from Rs 1,475.  HSBC said RIL's balance sheet deleveraging should accelerate in the coming quarters even as the earnings outlook of the company remains robust.  Nomura, too, maintained a buy recommendation on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 1,785 from Rs 1,575.  Nomura has raised its earnings estimates on RIL by 7-12 percent, citing that the outperformance of the company may sustain.  UBS also has a buy call on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,500, while Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating, with a target price of Rs 1,469, on the stock.  Citi has a buy recommendation on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,500.  &amp;quot;IMO impact on gross refining margins, progress on 4 ongoing transactions, gasification ramp-up, FTTH traction and IUC developments are the keys for the next two quarters,&amp;quot; said Citi in a note.  Macquarie has an outperform call with a target price of Rs 1,380, but Jefferies has an underperform view on RIL.  However, Jefferies has raised the target price to Rs 1,060 from Rs 1,025 earlier.  Credit Suisse (CS) has maintained a neutral call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,210 and said refining margin remained strong and was partly offset by weakness in petrochemical. The brokerage has highlighted a sharp reduction in Jio's capex which was down 40 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).    Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services has maintained a buy recommendation with a target price of Rs 1,630.  &amp;quot;We revise the valuation multiple for the core segment of refining and petchem to 8.5 times (from 7.5 times earlier) FY21E EV/EBITDA to factor in the enhanced delayed coker capacity, the widening of crude blend window for maximizing distillate yields prior to IMO and the revival in petchem margins for the company under its flexible feedstock utilisation,&amp;quot; said Motilal Oswal.  The domestic brokerage has raised the target price of Reliance Jio to Rs 280 from Rs 250.  Brokerage firm Antique Stock Broking, too, has retained a buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,555.  &amp;quot;We retain our buy rating on RIL, albeit with a revised target price of 1,555, as we roll earnings forward and introduce FY22E. In our view, the conclusion of large investment and eventual reduction of debt would add to positive sentiment,&amp;quot; said Antique Stock Broking.  &amp;quot;Expected infusion of capital by Saudi Aramco and BP, would only expedite reduction of debt. In addition, consumers facing business continue to grow in scale and profitability, thereby de-risking the earnings mix,&amp;quot; Antique Stock Broking added.  Emkay Global Financial Services has maintained a hold recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,540.  &amp;quot;We raise our refining EV/EBITDA multiple valuing oil-to-chemicals at $70 billion EV (against $75 billion for Aramco deal). We also reduce FY20/21E Jio capex to Rs 30,000-25,000 crore against Rs 40,000-35,000 crore earlier, though our overall capex and debt levels are largely the same,&amp;quot; said Emkay Global.  SBICAP Securities has a buy recommendation on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,670.  &amp;quot;We initiate coverage with a buy rating as we expect the strong growth momentum in telecom and retail business to continue,&amp;quot; said SBICAP Securities.  &amp;quot;Our target price implies an FY21E P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of 13.7 times (3 year average: 13.3 times), FY21E P/B (price-to-book&nbsp;ratio) of 1.9 times (3 year average: 1.5 times) and FY21E EV/EBITDA of 9.8 times (3 year average: 10.1 times),&amp;quot; said SBICAP Securities.  &amp;quot;We take comfort from the company&lsquo;s effort to address balance sheet concerns by expediting deleveraging exercise (via InvIT structure for its tower and fibre InvIT and potential stake sale in refining and petchem business to Saudi Aramco), and is targeting to become a zero net debt company by the end of FY21,&amp;quot; SBICAP Securities added.  Axis Capital, too, came out with a similar view on Reliance Industries after the company revealed its September quarter numbers. The brokerage has a 'buy' recommendation with a target price of Rs 1,650.  &amp;quot;A combination of diminishing headwinds and rising tailwinds shall drive the growth of Reliance Industries. We expect the stock to double in 4 years to Rs 2,790. Our 1-year SOTP-based target price stands at Rs 1,650,&amp;quot; said the brokerage.  As of October 18, the stock is up 26 percent on the BSE in Calendar 2019, in comparison to a 9 percent rise in the benchmark Sensex.

In Q2FY20, although corporates would have a lower base of profits, lower operating leverage in Q2FY20 would mean that margins may not show commensurate rise. A lot of these negative expectations are already in the price.  Corporate tax cuts will certainly lead to one-time adjustments and not upgrades.  However, at an aggregate level, revenues are expected to be slower on a YoY basis. But, this will not act as a deterrent suppressing the mood of Mr. Market. Markets should begin pricing in the revival of the economy given the stupendous government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) initiatives in place, said Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities.  Here is a look at the top 10 companies which declared September quarter results last week:  Reliance Industries Q2 profit beats estimates, Jio registers healthy growth  RIL, the country's most valued company by market capitalisation, reported highest every quarterly consolidated profit in September quarter, driven by refining, telecom and retail segments. Higher other income and lower tax cost also boost the bottom line.

Also read:&nbsp;RIL Q2 profit beats estimates; 10 key takeaways from quarterly result  RIL&rsquo;s thrust towards consumer facing businesses was evident in yet another stellar performance by its retail division. Reliance Retail remains among the biggest and fastest growing retail players in the world.      Key Positives  - Despite last year&rsquo;s high base, Reliance Retail reported a 27 percent growth YoY (year-on-year) in its top-line, led by new stores and healthy same-store sales. Retail revenue for Q2 FY20 stood at Rs 41,202 crore, an all-time quarterly high. Operational efficiencies led to margins improving noticeably YoY as well.  Also read | RIL Q2 result: Consumer business now contributes one-third of quarterly EBITDA, says CFO  -Jio saw a strong 33.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its net revenue which came in at Rs12,354 crore. The growth came on the back of net addition of 24 million subscribers in the quarter. Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base stood at 355.2 million.  Also read |&nbsp;Reliance Jio earnings: Q2 net profit rises 45.4% to Rs 990 crore  -Jio continues to positively surprise in terms of its operating margin. Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)margin expanded by 314.8 bps in the quarter gone by. The management highlighted that it was driven by operational efficiencies.  Key Negatives  -Weakness in global crude prices was reflected in lower realization for the refining segment. While the GRM (gross refining margin) was up sequentially, they remained below expectations at $9.4 per barrel. Lower differential between light and heavy crude and higher costs for heavy crude led to around a 7 percent year-on-year decline in EBIT (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization). Issues in Iran and Venezuela also hit refining margins to certain extent.    -The petchem segment saw a sharp growth in volumes. However, with weakness in prices of petrochemical products there was a 12 percent YoY dip in segment revenue. &nbsp;Demand revival in both polymer and polyester in the domestic market contributed to the volume growth. Addition of new capacity resulted in inventory overhang. Together with subdued global demand, this resulted in weak margins for most petchem products.  - While Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of growth moderated primarily due to base effects and increased competition. Strong competition and offers by Jio led to an ARPU decline of 8.9 percent on YoY basis. ARPU came in at Rs120 per month.    Outlook  The results were broadly in line with our expectations. The weakness in the traditional businesses was in line with global trends. However, we take a cue from the CFO's comments about strength in product demand and improving volumes which should aid performance in the current quarter. It is important to remember that major capex in the businesses is now at an end and benefits should accordingly start flowing in.  We believe Jio would continue to do well, going forward, on the back of its strategy of offering services at a reasonable price. Its focus on deeper and wider market penetration has made it the largest telecom operator in India in terms of subscriber base, within a very short time.  There are two factors which could aid earnings momentum for the telecom business. The first is the launch of JioGigaFiber services during the quarter, which is getting good traction from its customers. Secondly, the company&rsquo;s decision to start charging its customers 6 paisa per minute on the outgoing calls made to other networks to recover the Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC) which the company pays to other network providers. This would improve operating margins, at least for the next quarter.  For the retail business, going forward, revenue growth would be driven by aggressive brick-and-mortar store expansion, integration of online and offline retailing, measures to grow the customer loyalty base and exclusive agreements with more foreign lifestyle brands.  In a bid to improve margins, we expect greater emphasis will be laid on promoting private labels across segments, improving the product mix, undertaking store productivity initiatives to boost like-to-like sales and leveraging benefits of scale.  However, weak consumer demand, particularly in rural India, would be a challenge in the near future and will be something investors need to watch out for.

It rallied 6 percent during the quarter ended September 2019 while it surged 26 percent year-to-date.  Here are 10 key takeaways from Q2 earnings:  Profit  Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries registered an 18.34 percent year-on-year growth in second-quarter consolidated profit to Rs 11,262 crore. The sequential increase was 11.46 percent.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said,&amp;quot; The Company has reported record net profit for the quarter. These excellent results reflect the benefits of our integrated Oil to Chemicals (O2C) value chain and the rapid scale-up of our Consumer businesses. During this quarter, our O2C businesses gained from favourable fuel margins environment, feedstock sourcing flexibility and higher petrochemicals volumes.&amp;quot;  Also Read:&nbsp;Highest ever quarterly profit of Rs 11,262 cr  Revenue  Consolidated revenue during the quarter increased 3.63 percent to Rs 148,526 crore compared to the year-ago period, but the same declined 5.4 percent on a sequential basis.  Increase in revenue YoY is primarily on account of robust growth in retail &amp;amp;amp; digital services businesses which grew by 27 percent and 43 percent, respectively. This was partially offset by decrease in refining and petrochemicals segment revenue with 17.7 percent fall in Brent crude price.  Operating Income  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 3.9 percent sequentially to Rs 22,152 crore and margin expanded by 130bps QoQ to 14.91 percent in the quarter ended September 2019.  Gross Refining Margin  Reliance Industries reported gross refining margin at $9.4 a barrel for the quarter, against $8.1 a barrel in June quarter and $9.5 a barrel in September quarter last year. It was lower than a CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts which was pegged at $9.5 a barrel.  &amp;quot;Refining margins improved QoQ on the back of strengthening light and middle distillate and FO cracks,&amp;quot; company said.  The benchmark Singapore Complex Margin averaged $6.5 a barrel in Q2FY20 as compared to $3.5 a barrel in Q1FY20 and $6.1 a barrel in Q2FY19, it added.  Refining Business  Refining business, which contributed 65 percent of total operating revenue, registered a 4.4 percent sequential degrowth to Rs 97,229 crore during the quarter, but its EBIT grew 10 percent and margin increased by 70 bps QoQ.  The same degrew by 1.6 percent year-on-year due to lower crude prices and EBIT decreased by 6.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,957 crore mainly due to marginally lower GRM and narrow light-heavy crude differentials.  Petrochemical Segment  Petrochemical segment revenue grew by 2.5 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 38,538 crore and at an operating level, the EBIT increased 1.3 percent but margin contracted 30 bps QoQ in September quarter.  The segment de-grew year-on-year by 11.9 percent reflecting fall in prices of petrochemical products, the company said. EBIT decreased by 6.4 percent YoY mainly due to weaker petrochemical product margins offset by record petrochemical production and cost optimization through light-feed cracking.  &amp;quot;There was a significant decline in margins for major products &ndash; MEG (-53 percent), PX (-37 percent), PE (-25 percent) and PP (-21 percent) as a result of new capacity, inventory overhang and global demand slowdown, &amp;quot; the company said.  Reliance Jio  Jio registered a healthy 11.1 percent sequential growth in the second-quarter profit at Rs 990 crore on revenue of Rs 12,354 crore that increased by 5.8 percent QoQ, boosted by Diwali plan.  Reliance Jio has become India's largest mobility services provider, and also has the highest market share in terms of 4G subscriber base and 4G data traffic in India, Mukesh Ambani said.  &amp;quot;Jio is still adding more than 1 crore new customers every month and is now geared to kick-start other growth engines,&amp;quot; he added.

In a report, the brokerage said the key drivers necessary for Reliance to breach $200 billion market cap in 24 months from current $122 billion market cap are new commerce initiative of empowering Kiranas in unorganised retail market by offering MPoS (mobile point-of-sale), entry into SME enterprise space with Microsoft, Jio's fiber broadband business and digital initiatives like advertising.  &amp;quot;We think the market is giving little credit to these initiatives given limited visibility,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;We expect near-term momentum to be strong.&amp;quot;  Its bull case scenario that takes m-cap to $200 billion assumed Jio's per mobile phone user revenue increasing to Rs 177 in FY22 from Rs 151, 10 million Kirana's paying the company Rs 750 a month for installing M-PoS, and broadband users reaching 12 million by FY22 with 60 per cent of them paying an average of Rs 840 a month.  &amp;quot;In our bull-case, we look at a 24-month fair-value of the company as we believe most of the new businesses which are in gestation period will take around 24 months to acquire scale and contribute meaningfully to RIL's fair value,&amp;quot; it said.  Reliance Industries (RIL) is India's largest petrochemical and second-largest oil refining company. It has significant investments in telecom, consumer retail and media businesses in India. Its telecom subsidiary, Jio has garnered a large number of paying subscribers and has the opportunity to emerge as a top-three telecom player in a growing Indian market on the back of the launch of fiber-based broadband services.  The report said the &amp;quot;upside from base-case is predominately driven by new commerce gaining scale and helping B2B retail momentum as well ($32 billion in additional enterprise value); Jio gaining traction in enterprise, fixed broadband business + better than expected ad revenues/upselling services ($222 billion in additional EV); more pronounced telecom tariff hike ($10 bn in additional EV); and better than expected IMO contribution + lower capex for a couple of year&amp;quot;.  India's domestic shipping sector is to implement the International Maritime Organization's low sulfur mandate for marine fuels, which will raise margins for diesel.  The brokerage said retail will be the biggest driver of upside as the firm's new commerce business gains traction in the $800 billion unorganised markets.  &amp;quot;On an average, we expect 10 million Kirana's to contribute to RIL of Rs 750/month on back of its M-POS monthly fees and contribution from inventory management etc,&amp;quot; it said.  Stating that the entire cellular phone business industry would see a meaningful tariff hike by FY2022, it said telecom business of RIL will contribute more than a quarter of the projected EV (enterprise value).  Also, Jio's entry would expand the SME market - currently the majority of them do not use any enterprise offerings. &amp;quot;In the enterprise business, we expect Jio to target 15 million SME users. In this, we assume 60 per cent conversion (i.e. 9 million paying SME by FY22) and expect each SME to pay on an average Rs 2,000 per month,&amp;quot; it said.  It estimated the Jio's broadband business users would be 12 million by FY22, of which 60 per cent could pay an average of Rs 800 per cent, it said.  In the oil-to-chemicals business, it expected better than expected IMO impact, with refining margins moving to $13 per barrel from $11.

Customers on its network will be asked to pay 6 paisa per minute on outgoing voice calls made to non-Jio networks to recover the IUC which the company pays to other network providers.  IUC is what one mobile telecom operator pays to another, when its customers make outgoing mobile calls to the other operator&rsquo;s customers.  In this note, we attempt to analyse the impact of additional charges on RJio&rsquo;s financial performance and the impact on the stock price of Reliance Industries.  Catalyst for raising the tariffs  Earlier, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had decided to reduce IUC from 14 paise per min to 6 paise per min effective from October 1, 2017 and further to zero from January 1, 2020.  However, TRAI appears to be having second thoughts on whether to bring IUC down to zero or not, which has led to significant uncertainties for RJio. The company has in all paid nearly Rs.13,500 crore as net IUC charges to other operators.  Therefore, in light of this regulatory uncertainty RJio has decided to recover the IUC cost from its customers. It has, however, assured that this charge will be removed as soon as TRAI implements the zero IUC regime. In fact, RJIo is giving additional data along with the IUC top-up vouchers so that there is no effective tariff increase for the customer till 31st December 2019.  Implications for the sector  There is no direct benefit to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea from this move, as they would continue to get the same amount of IUC from RJio as earlier. But the decision augurs well for the entire industry, which has seen declining Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). This could lead to acceptance of higher tariffs by customers, thereby giving some leeway to service providers to increase tariffs. RJio, specifically, should be able to see an improvement in its operating margin.  Implications for the company  Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that levying IUC charges would lead to Rs3,624 crore incremental benefit in RJio&rsquo;s EBITDA, approximately 20 percent increment on the basis of annualised Q1 FY20 EBITDA.    What does this mean for the Reliance Industries stock?  The passing on of IUC to customers has been implemented only for one quarter till TRAI phases out IUC charges completely and hence there would not be much impact on the RJio&rsquo;s financial performance. If IUC is made nil then all companies will be on the same footing.  However, if IUC continues to remain in force even after one quarter, then it will mean that RJio will not have to continue to bear the costs of IUC for a longer than expected period. Our conservative SOTP (sum of the parts) suggests that the Reliance Industries&rsquo; stock could then get a 4 percentage points bump-up in compared to if the IUC charges were temporary (see chart).

Though the Nifty has fallen nearly 300 points from the recent high to a low of 11,390 levels, the primary trends is still intact as it is still trading above its 200-day SMA. Oscillators and momentum Indicators like RSI and MACD have been showing strength on the daily and weekly charts for the Nifty and Bank Nifty.   The index has formed a major bottom at 10,670 and rallied towards 11,695 recently. The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracements of the swing is placed at 11,303, which is likely to act as an immediate support going forward.  We have seen Put writing at 11,300-11,400 strike prices, indicating that the Nifty is likely to find strong support in the vicinity of 11,300-11,400. Unless the index closes below it, the trend would be considered bullish for the markets. On the upside, 11,700 would act as an immediate resistance where Calls have been written.  The Bank Nifty has formed a major bottom at 26,643 and rallied more than 4,000 points to touch an intraday high of 30,800. The 50 percent Fibonacci retracements of the entire swing is placed at 28,700, which is likely to act as an immediate support going forward. This support level coincides with the 200-day SMA placed at 28,766 levels.  The Nifty Smallcap index, which corrected nearly&nbsp;five percent from its recent high, has now reached a strong support of 20-day SMA, which is placed at 5,566 levels.&nbsp;The&nbsp;midcap/smallcap indices have also corrected and may see a bounceback from here on.  Considering technical and derivatives factors, we view the recent fall in the market as a correction in the overall uptrend. Our advice would be to use this correction to accumulate longs in the Nifty with the stop loss of 11,300 levels. On the higher side, the Nifty could move to its immediate resistance of 11,700. Any close above 11,700 levels would result in further short covering, which might push it to even 12,000 levels in coming months.  One should accumulate long positions in the Bank Nifty with a stop loss at 28,700 levels. On the higher side, an immediate resistance is seen in the vicinity of 29,800-30,000 levels.  Here are the top&nbsp;three stocks that can&nbsp;return 6-11 percent:  Reliance Industries: Buy | Target: Rs&nbsp;1410 | Stop loss: Rs 1285 | Return: 6%  The stock price has broken out on the daily chart last Friday by closing above the resistance level of Rs 1305 levels. It has closed at three month high yesterday with higher volumes.&nbsp; Short term trend of the stock is bullish where it is trading above its 5, 20 and 200 day SMA. Oscillators and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD showing strength in the stock on the daily and weekly charts. Therefore we recommend buying Reliance Industries for the upside target of Rs 1410, keeping a stop loss at Rs 1285.  UPL: Buy | Target: Rs 640 | Stop loss: Rs 580 | Return 6%  UPL has broken out on the daily chart by closing above the resistance level of Rs 598 levels. It also closed above 200-day SMA level of Rs 585 with higher volumes. Oscillators and momentum Indicators like RSI and MACD showing strength in the stock on the daily charts.

In the offer document seeking bids for 5 million standard cubic meters per day of natural gas to be produced from R-Series fields in the block from mid-2020, Reliance and its partner BP plc have provided a draft of the Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) to be signed by potential buyers.  The GSPA provides for &amp;quot;immediate termination&amp;quot; of the agreement and recovery of any losses in case of violation of anti-bribery and anti-money laundering clauses.  Reliance and BP sought an undertaking that buyer or its affiliates had not bribed anyone in last five years and none of their directors, officers, or key employees has been convicted or investigated of any offence involving money laundering in last 10 years.  It sought indemnity for the sellers (Reliance and BP) from any loss or damage due to failure of contractors or third parties associated with buyers to comply with bribery and anti-money laundering laws.  The company asked the seller to inform it in writing of any breach of these laws by any of the contractors or third parties to the gas sale agreements.  Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites and MJ by 2022 to add 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas production in phases. A similar GSPA is likely for the other two sets of finds as well.  Reliance, which is the operator of KG-D6 with 60 per cent stake, has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3) -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.  The output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.3 mmscmd. MA field ceased to produce last year.  BP holds 30 per cent stake in the block while the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources of Canada.  The GSPA's an anti-bribery clause provides that the signatories or their affiliates or associated persons have not engaged any activity to &amp;quot;paying, offering or offering to give, promising or agreeing to give, or authorising the payment (directly or indirectly through any third party) of any monies... to any government official in order to obtain or retain business or to influence official action&amp;quot; in last five years.

Also, such contractors and third parties will have to comply with all of Bribery Acts and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, and &amp;quot;undertake to indemnify each of the sellers, their affiliates and associated persons against any loss or damages suffered on account of any failure by such contractors or third parties to comply with the aforesaid Laws,&amp;quot; it said.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

Under Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries is pivoting from an oil-led conglomerate into a more consumer-facing company, selling everything from handbags to broadband to try to tap into Indians' rising disposable incomes.  Reliance Brands already runs high-end stores in India with some 40 foreign partners, including British label Burberry, shoemaker Steve Madden and New York-based Iconix Brand Group Inc, through joint ventures and franchises.  It also wrapped up its first international acquisition in May, buying Hamleys, the world's oldest toy retailer, for $88.5 million. And it is not planning to stop there.  &amp;quot;The Hamleys acquisition ... has already whetted our appetite,&amp;quot; Reliance Brands CEO Darshan Mehta said in an interview in India's financial capital Mumbai.  &amp;quot;Internationally, much of brick and mortar retail is in a lot of pain,&amp;quot; he added at the Reliance Brands office plastered with photographs of models advertising its breadth of brands.  &amp;quot;No wonder - what may have once been available for 100 is now available for 50.&amp;quot;  Western companies &amp;quot;over built&amp;quot; their store estates and did not see the &amp;quot;e-commerce gorilla&amp;quot; coming, Mehta said. &amp;quot;Look around and you will always find many of them up for sale, whether it be in New York, London or Milan.&amp;quot;  Mehta declined to give details on talks. He said Reliance had no timeline and often took years to strike deals.  &amp;quot;You can't hurry love,&amp;quot; he said.  Reliance is already India's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in terms of revenue and number of stores. And Ambani, whom Forbes says is the world's 13th richest man, is also scaling up his grocery and wholesale businesses.  Reliance Brands' products are available at 788 locations spread across exclusive brand outlets, shopping malls and airports. The company is planning to open around 120 stores in India in the fiscal year to March 2020, Mehta said.  The company is also seeking to partner with brands in two segments where it so far does not have a presence: beauty and athletic lifestyle wear.  Multi-brand sports, wellness and fitness are the categories of interest for the company, Mehta said, adding women's and men's beauty products were also the target areas.  However, Reliance Brands - which Mehta said chiefly targets around 50 million affluent Indians - still remains a small part of the Reliance conglomerate, which made a net profit of $5.5 billion on $87 billion of revenue in the year ended March 2019.

Fitch said the outlook on the local-currency IDR was revised to positive due to RIL&rsquo;s potential to further deleverage.  The revisions come after Reliance on August 12 announced that it would reduce its net debt by the financial year ending March 2021 (FY21).  During the AGM, chairman Mukesh Ambani also announced that RIL would sell a 20 percent stake in its oil-to-chemical division to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco).  &amp;quot;This investment by Saudi Aramco is subject to due diligence, definitive agreements, regulatory and other customary approvals. This partnership will cover all of RIL's refining and petrochemicals assets, including 51 percent of the petroleum retail JV,&amp;quot; Ambani said.

The company ended financial year 2018-19 with a net debt of Rs 1,54,478 crore.  &amp;quot;The affirmation of rating at 'BBB' reflect RIL's strong business profile&mdash;a large-scale refinery with a capacity of around 1.2 million barrels a day and industry-leading asset quality that enables it to consistently deliver a gross refining margin (GRM) above regional benchmarks,&amp;quot; Fitch said.  RIL also benefits from its vertically integrated business model and dominant market position in petrochemicals, which smooth outs profit volatility along the refining and petrochemical value chain, it added.  The company had completed capex to increase its downstream integration, which improved feedstock flexibility, it said.  Fitch expects RIL's digital-services business Jio to continue its strong growth. Jio has achieved a leading position in its wireless subscriber base, though it is still evolving, as reflected in the recent spinoff of its tower and fibre assets to investment trusts and plans to roll out a fibre-to-the-home business.  Jio had more than 340 million subscribers, Ambani said during the AGM. RIL was ready to kickstart internet of things (IoT), home broadband, enterprise and MSME broadband during the year, with an annual revenue opportunity for Jio at Rs 20,000 crore from IoT only, he said.  RIL's financial profile was also likely to improve, supported by strong operating cash flow from its expanded petrochemical and refining business, Fitch said.

The Aramco transaction structure is yet to be finalised and also remains subject to regulatory and other approvals.  RIL expects that the transaction will close before March 2020.  It will receive the proceeds in three stages - 50 per cent on closing, another 25 per cent after one year of closing and the balance 25 per cent in the following year.  The O2C business will be carved out into a division where Aramco will have an economic interest. It will have its own management and accounts.  &amp;quot;However, currently there are no firm plans to create a separate legal entity for this division (except for the fuel marketing business, which will be in a separate entity),&amp;quot; it said.  &amp;quot;The stake sales are in line with the company's target to reduce its net debt to zero by March 2021 and reflect the company's commitment to maintaining a strong financial profile despite significant capital spending over the last five years,&amp;quot; it added.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

Through aggressive pricing and marketing strategies, Jio has transformed the digital connectivity in India with affordable data tariffs and free voice services.  The company has penetrated the mobile broadband market at an exponential rate and garnered a user base of more than 300 million subscribers within three years of its launch in 2016. Since the start of this fiscal year, Jio has nosed ahead of Bharti&nbsp;Airtel in terms of subscriber base and now has a market share of around 28 percent. Vodafone Idea continues to dominate the market, but its user base has been shrinking since the launch of Jio.  At the AGM, the management gave insights into industry as well their business strategy for Jio, which assumes prime importance in Reliance&rsquo;s overall business.&nbsp; The company would continue to disrupt the entire value chain and intends to expand further deeper and wider market penetration into existing and newer markets.  Growth rates to moderate   Jio&rsquo;s financial performance has been improving on a sequential basis as the company continues to gain share from its competitors. In FY19, Jio&rsquo;s top line stood in excess of Rs 38,000 crore as the company increased its user base by nearly 50 percent. The operating margins were stable throughout and stood close to 38.9 percent for the full year.  While the consumer base has expanded, the pace of addition has slowed due to competitive intensity and base effect. During Q1, the company added 24 million subscribers at a run rate of 8 million per month. At this pace, the company is on track to achieve 500 million subscribers in the next 18-20 months. &nbsp;Considering the existing operating metrics in a favourable scenario, Jio&rsquo;s revenue run-rate would double over the next two years.  Our base case assumes a conservative stance taking into account a moderation in growth rate, higher customer churn rate and lower operating margins. Revenue as well as operating profits are anticipated to grow by 50 percent even under the base case.    New businesses have high revenue potential  Jio has already disrupted pre-paid mobile market and the company now plans to leverage the technology, infrastructure and user base to enter into newer business segments of the telecom market. At the AGM, the company announced that the trial runs for Jio Fiber are nearing completion and the home broadband services are expected to be rolled out commercially in the first week of September.  Similarly, the beta phase of enterprise broadband services are under way and the services will be rolled out officially next year. The company is also targeting Internet of Things (IoT) as it is an extension of Internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects. Through smart meters and other such devices, Jio aims to transform basic homes into smarter ones and gain share in the 20,000 crore IoT market.  The market size for home and enterprise broadband is pegged at 18 million and 45 million, respectively. At 5 percent market penetration, these two segments together could add another Rs 6,000 crore to Jio&rsquo;s top line in the next 2 years. The digital offering also stands to benefit from complimentary revenue streams such as interactive gaming as well as revenue and cost synergies related to the acquisition of cable operators - GTPL Hathway and Den networks.    Cash flows to improve, balance sheet to strengthen   Jio has been on an aggressive expansion spree as the company has invested nearly Rs 3.5 lakh crore towards establishing the largest optical fiber footprint in the country. The company has been going through structural and operational changes in recent months and has demerged about Rs 1.17 lakh crore of hard infrastructure into separate infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs).  The objective of this demerger is to take fibre and tower assets off the balance sheet, which would also lead to the debt associated with those assets being taken off. Jio has already entered an agreement with Brookfield Infrastructure for an investment of Rs 25,215 crore into Tower InvIT. The money will be used to repay existing financial liabilities of Jio, which are estimated at around Rs 1,70,000 crore (EBITDA cover of ~9x ).    Jio&rsquo;s high capex, leverage and weak cash flow have been a key concern for Reliance&rsquo;s shareholders. However, the business is 5G ready and the capex cycle is nearing the completion phase and has enough spare capacity to match up to the growing demand. Going forward, free cash flows should improve substantially on the back of monetisation of tower assets, commercialisation of fibre business and minimal capex requirements. This augurs well for shareholders as increasing free cash flows would help deleverage the balance sheet and improve its return ratios over the next couple of years.

The good news from the company's AGM is not just the roadmap to net zero debt by end of FY21, but a gradual change from a cyclical commodity play to one which will be increasingly driven by consumer facing businesses. And that means much more stable, predictable cash flow and hence better rewards for the investors.  Strategic partnership to correct capital allocation in legacy businesses  While staying with the basic businesses which it has painstakingly build, the big investments for the future are being made elsewhere. BP is acquiring 49% stake in the petro-retail business for Rs 7000 crore. Reliance and Saudi Aramco have agreed to form a long-term Partnership whereby the later will invest in Reliance for a 20% stake in Oil to Chemicals division at an enterprise value of US$ 75 billion. This deal covers all of RIL's refining and petrochemicals assets, including 51% of the petroleum retail joint venture. In the exploration business too, the driver will be the joint venture with BP. The focus will gradually be on higher value added products, like speciality chemicals and away from commoditised products.    The incremental focus will be the consumer facing businesses and by Chairman Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s own admission, it will not be long before they make up for half of the consolidated EBITDA.  Why this proposition is so unique?  However, what is more interesting about the new Reliance&rsquo;s strategy is the enviable reach into every aspect of Indian life (through Jio, entertainment and retail) and the access to the wealth of data on Indian population/business that will be totally irreplicable by any competitor. This will provide tremendous cross-selling opportunity or entering any-consumer facing business much easier at a later date.  Let us turn to Jio first. With 340 million strong customer base and addition of more than 10 million new customers every month, the half a billion customer milestone is well within sight.  However, what is music to the ears of the shareholders is the fact that the big capex phase (invested close to Rs 3.5 lakh crore) in telecom is coming to an end and it is time to reap benefits by effectively sweating the assets. Reliance plans to do that with its multipronged strategy.  The company has already started reducing debt in the balance sheet with divestment of about Rs 1.17 lakh crore of hard infrastructure into separate infrastructure investment trusts or InvITs to better monetize and unlock value from these assets. The company is eyeing new revenue streams to better leverage the assets created through pan-India offerings like Internet of Things or IoT, home broadband, enterprise broadband and broadband for small and medium businesses. With strong revenue traction and minimal capex, cash flow should improve remarkably in the future.  Jio aims to connect at least 1 billion devises on its IoT platform, translating to Rs &nbsp;20,000 crore per annum revenue opportunity. Jio Fiber plans to cover 20 million residences and 15 million business in 1,600 towns. High speed broadband connectivity, digital set top box, landline phone connection, free calls within India, smart home solutions, a television set, automatic subscription to leading OTT platform are all the carrots offered that should enable faster penetration of Jio Fiber.  For businesses, Jio will give easier and cheaper access to blockchain technology all over India, In partnership with Microsoft, Jio would set up a network of large world-class datacenters across India wherein Microsoft will bring its Azure cloud platform. So Jio aims to capture lion&rsquo;s share of technology spend by Indian businesses, going forward.  The connectivity and cloud infrastructure would be available for free for startups and for a very economical rate for small and medium enterprises. But for Jio the long-term gains in terms of partnership with these businesses and knowledge and understanding of the customer ecosystem will be invaluable.  The understanding and knowledge of every customer and every small and aspiring business in India will give the group an unparalleled database that its retail business can ride on successfully.  Jio a driver for retail as well  The retail business has grown phenomenally, registering a 7-fold increase in revenue and a 14-fold increase in profit in the last six years. It is the best proxy for the consumption story of India.  The business has achieved a significant milestone with our turnover crossing Rs 1,30,000 crore in the last year with an EBIDTA margin of 4.7 percent, which is better than most retailers.  What&rsquo;s in for the shareholders?  With a gradual de-focus on cyclical commodity businesses and thrust on consumer-facing ones, the shareholders should be looking at substantial value unlocking, going forward.    Source: Company, Moneycontrol Research  Our rough estimates suggest that these two businesses contributes close to 85 percent of the current market capitalisation, leaving substantial room for upside given that the company is staring at the end of this capex cycle, substantial de-levering through strategic sales and unlocking value in promising businesses.

In particular, a concrete deadline of 18 months for reducing the net debt to zero will assuage the concerns of investors and analysts, some of whom were calling attention to the company&rsquo;s rising liabilities.  Under the deal with Saudi Aramco -- the largest foreign investment in RIL&rsquo;s history -- the Saudi petroleum major will buy 20 percent in RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemicals business at an enterprise value of $75 billion or approximately 5.25 lakh crore.  At the end of financial year 2018-19, RIL had net debt of Rs 1.54 lakh on its books. RIL&rsquo;s deal with Saudi Aramco and BP, monetisation of telecom assets through an infrastructure investment trust, strong investor interest in Jio and Reliance Retail, and the proposed monetisation of real estate and financial investments should help the group achieve the net zero debt target within the deadline.  Ambani said the deals with Aramco and BP would be completed within this financial year and that the proceeds from the two deals were about Rs 1.1 lakh crore.  He added that the group had received &ldquo;strong interest and commitments from reputed global investors&rdquo; for telecom assets worth around Rs 1.25 lakh crore that were spun off and housed in an infrastructure investment trust. Ambani expressed confidence that the transactions would be completed by the end of this financial year.  RIL&rsquo;s stated objective of both consumer-centric businesses (retail, telecom) and the legacy businesses contributing equally to the overall revenues over the next decade, appears to be on track.  The consumer businesses now collectively contribute nearly 32 percent to the consolidated operating profits, up from 2 percent five years ago.  In his speech, Ambani said that RIL had proved skeptics wrong that the group could not succeed in consumer businesses.  &ldquo;Jio and Reliance Retail have proved them wrong. If these two consumer businesses had been separately listed companies, each would be ranked among the top 10 in India today, in terms of value,&rdquo; Ambani said.  Ambani said the investment cycle for Jio was now complete and that only marginal investments in access were now required to build capacity to meet growing demand. This gives the business huge operating leverage and would result in robust returns over the years.  Jio will now bet on Internet of Things, and broadband for homes and businesses as its next growth engines.  In the retail business, Ambani said that Reliance Retail had cemented its position as India&rsquo;s number one retailer with a turnover of Rs 1.3 lakh crore last year.  Ambani highlighted the fact that milestone was achieved faster than any other retail company in the world, and that Reliance Retail&rsquo;s operating profit margins were among the best globally.  RIL has plans to take both Jio and Reliance Retail public over the next five years.  Ambani said that the group had received &ldquo;strong interest from strategic and financial investors&rdquo; for both businesses.  On the slowdown in the economy, Ambani said that it was temporary as the fundamentals of the economy were quite strong and there was political stability.  &ldquo;The opportunities will grow further with structural reforms. The government is laying the foundation of new institutions for business promotion and regulation,&rdquo; Ambani said.  He assured shareholders that as RIL achieved a net zero debt target, they would be rewarded &ldquo;abundantly through higher dividends, periodic bonus issues and other means, and at a more accelerated pace than any time in our history.&rdquo;  Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.

Reliance will sell 20 percent stake in oil to chemical business to Saudi Aramco, he said. The company also announced a long-term agreement with Microsoft to accelerate &ldquo;digital transformation of India to launch new cloud data centres, ensuring more organisations can access the tools and platforms they need to build their own digital capability&rdquo;.  The stocks rallied from Rs 964, recorded on July 5, 2018 when RIL held its 41st AGM, to Rs 1,162 on August 9, translating into a gain of more than 20 percent.  The share touched its 52-week high Rs 1,413.75 and 52-week low Rs 1,017 on May 2, 2019 and October 25, 2018, respectively. It is trading 17.81 percent below its 52-week high and 14.26 percent above its 52-week low.  Here is what some experts/analysts&rsquo; say on how shares will react on August 13:  Gagan Dixit, vice president, oil &amp;amp;amp; gas analyst, Elara Capital:  The combined value of Aramco&rsquo;s refining and petchem at USD 75 billion (Elara: USD 73 billion) is positive. It will provide much-needed capital for oil-to-chemicals expansion plans in a phased manner over the next decade, as mentioned by RIL FY19 annual report. We estimate 12mnMT rise in petchem capacity should require another around $11bn in long term.  But in near term, it's a positive development that Rs 1.05 trillion available from Aramco and Rs 0.8-0.9 trillion/annum operating cash flow would help de-leverage RIL within two years.  We believe key trigger for conclusion of RIL-Aramco deal was declining probability of Maharashtra refinery of OMCs, where Aramco committed earlier as its cost jumped Rs 3 trillion to Rs 4 trillion due to delays and environment-related commitments.  Ajay Bodke, CEO at PMS Prabhudas Lilladher:  Market is going to heartily welcome the seminal announcement by RIL, India's largest and most respected company, of 20 percent stake sale in its oil-to-chemical (OTC) business to the world's largest oil company Saudi Aramco.  It reinforces Mukesh Ambani's reputation as India's top business leader, whose global vision has transformed the country's economic milieu. This is inarguably India's largest-ever FDI inflow and would help dissipate the gloomy sentiment pervading the economy and stock markets.  This programme to aggressively pursue deleveraging in businesses such as OTC, fibre and tower and emerge as a zero-debt company in the next 18 months will strengthen the consolidated balance sheet leading to strong valuation re-rating of the stock. RIL continues to remain as the pre-eminent player on the Indian economic juggernaut that is likely to touch $10 trillion by 2030.  SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com:  The stock could open 4-5 percent, or Rs 50-70, higher on August 13, SP Tulsian said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  He expects the stock to breach its Rs 1,400-mark and to see a new high in 2019. It is an excellent stock to buy given the kind of expected revenue increase with zero-net debt status in the coming 18 months.  He had said earlier that Credit Suisse concerns over $65 billion debt was not the right amount and had been bothering market a lot in the last few sessions, Tulsian said. With a net worth of Rs 4 lakh crore and businesses ranging from refinery, oil-to-chemical, retail to Jio, it would definitely cheer the market and profit will rise in next two or three years through asset monetisation and Saudi Aramco deal which is EPS accretive, he said.  Deven Choksey, MD of KR Choksey Investment Managers:  Those looking to invest in the company, could still put in money at current levels, as the stocks could reach a new high in 2019, and more than double in the next 2 years, Deven Choksey, MD of KR Choksey Investment Managers, told CNBC-TV18.  Sanjeev Jain, VP Equity Research at Sunness Capital India Pvt Ltd:  The chance of the stock touching new highs is strong in 2019. The Aramco deal as well as the joint venture with BP are the key positives. The company has laid out a plan to become debt-free by FY21. I expect the market may take it positively and a gap-up opening is possible on August 13.  Rajiv Sharma, SPICAP Securities:  From Vodafone Idea perspective, Jio aims to increase subscriber base from 340 million to 500 million, with a run rate of 10 million per month, which means no immediate respite in the Indian wireless space. Jio will continue to be aggressive on customer acquisition.&nbsp;After the Aramco deal, a&nbsp;tariff hike looks very unlikely.&nbsp;So, from a Vodafone-Idea perspective on the wireless side, I think this is negative as there will be no immediate relief, which they really needed,&nbsp; Sharma told CNBC-TV18.  Jal Irani, oil and gas analyst at Edelweiss Financial Services:  There is a vertical and horizontal integration to generate value. Retail and Jio are in the process of that value creation, Irani said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  It is a game-changer AGM, given JioFiber's price plan at Rs 700 with potential revenue generation of Rs 14,000 crore under telecom business, focus on retail business, deal with the Saudi Aramco and plan to become a debt-free company.  Reliance generally invests in new-age businesses early, grooms them and monetises them early rather than wait for a long period of 20 years, he added.  Nitin Soni, Fitch Ratings:  Mukesh Ambani's whole presentation is quite compelling. The pricing plan for JioFiber at Rs 700, with speed from 100 Mbps to Ggbps is a game-changer with affordable rates, along with first day first show movies on Jio and cross-selling of various services, Soni said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  Prakash Diwan, altamountcapital.com  As Reliance moved from B2B to B2C, Diwan expects more than 50 percent contribution from B2C to revenue in the years to come.  Also RIL moving from oil business to oil-to-chemicals (OTC) indicates that it is moving out of traditional business, hence thumbs up to its adaptability, Diwan said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  Company started with telecom, then entertainment, media and now internet of things (IoT) technology, which is a strong conversion. For these things, valuations in China and the US are phenomenal. Hence, overall the AGM is very strong.  The stock lost more than 20 percent in last three months due to debt concerns. But with Saudi Aramco deal and Jio asset monetisation, its aims to be zero-debt company in 18 months will change a lot of calculations in terms of valuations and stock price in days to come, he added.  Also with dividend yield of 15 percent and expectations of reaching around 25 percent plus zone, the stock re-rating will be high.  The telecom business plan was an absolute killer for Vodafone Idea, but Bharti Airtel may not feel the pinch,&nbsp;Diwan said.  Sameer Kalra, founder, Target Investing:  Keeping buy rating, we believe this clearly lays down the path of divestment to repay the debt, which certain investors were doubting.  Next 12 months of new products and launch will set a high-growth phase, which will generate higher cash flows as reduction of debt and only maintained capex will be required."

(RIL) CMD Mukesh Ambani addressed the company&rsquo;s 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 12. Here&rsquo;s the full text of the address:  My Dear Shareowners,  A very warm good morning to each and every one of you.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 42nd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited.  The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2019, along with the Directors' and Auditors' report, a Letter to the Shareholders, and Management's Discussion and Analysis, have already been circulated to you.  With your permission, I would like to take them as read.  1.&nbsp;Business and Financial Performance  Dear Shareholders,  In the Golden Decade of Reliance, I am proud to inform you that it was yet another year of robust and record performance.  Reliance became India's largest and most profitable company - both in public and private sectors.  We are the only diversified multi-sector Indian enterprise with three major growth engines in one single corporate entity  &ndash; Oils to Chemicals division, Jio and Retail.  All three have done exceedingly well in the past year.  We are also incubating newer growth engines.  Sceptics used to say that Reliance cannot succeed in consumer businesses.  Jio and Reliance Retail have proved them wrong.  If these two consumer businesses had been separately listed companies, each would be ranked among the top 10 in India today, in terms of value.  Jio crossed the 340 million subscriber mark to remain the world's fastest growing digital services company.  Today, Jio is India's largest telecom enterprise in terms of subscribers, revenues and profits.  Jio has truly become the DIGITAL GATEWAY OF INDIA.  Reliance Retail has crossed ` 130,000 crore turnover to cement its position as India's largest retailer.  It is four times larger than the 2nd largest retail player. It is larger than all the other major retailers put together.  Our two consumer businesses now collectively contribute nearly 32% to the consolidated EBITDA, up from 2% five years ago.  The day is not far when their share would be 50%. The third growth engine is our Oils to Chemicals business.  Let me now highlight Reliance's record contribution to the Indian economy:  Largest exporter -- Rs 2,24,391 crore exports to 107 countries accounting for 9.8% of India's total merchandise exports.  Highest payer of customs and excise duty in the private sector -- Rs 26,379 crore.  Highest payer of GST amongst all public and private sector companies -- Rs 67,320 crore.  Highest payer of Income tax in the private sector -- Rs 12,191 crore.  Dear Shareholders,  The coming year will mark the beginning of the most ambitious Value Creation strategy in the history of Reliance and in the history of India.  At the heart of our new value creation strategy is our innovative Philosophy of transforming relationships into partnerships.  Partnerships with leading global and Indian companies.  Partnerships with millions of local businesses, SMEs and micro-enterprises across India.  Partnerships with new tech-enabled businesses, platforms and social enterprises.  All these partnerships will form a new business coalition capable of creating exponential value for our five stakeholders: Indian economy, Indian people, our customers, employees and shareowners.  Dear Shareholders,  The future of India &ndash; and also the future of Reliance -- has never looked brighter to me than now.  As India is getting transformed into New India, Reliance will also transform itself into New Reliance.  Our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has set the goal of making India a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024. I fully endorse this ambitious goal.  Indeed, I can clearly see India becoming a 10 trillion dollar economy by 2030, with every Indian as a beneficiary. This is achievable. This is necessary. This is inevitable.  I say this because digital-driven GDP growth is not only exponential but can also be inclusive.  Our own value creation strategy will prove this. The slowdown in some sectors of the economy is temporary. The fundamentals of the Indian economy are very strong. The opportunities will grow further with structural reforms. India has political stability.  The government is laying the foundation of new institutions for business promotion and regulation.  New long-term measures are being taken to improve ease of living for all citizens, and reduce income inequality. India is rising. No power on earth can stop India from rising higher.  2. Oils to Chemicals Business  Dear Shareowners,  Let me focus on Reliance's most valuable business today &ndash; the Oils to Chemicals division.  It is formed by combining our petrochemicals and refining businesses.  Reliance has the most complex and integrated Oils to Chemicals business globally.  Our Oils to Chemicals business has the ability to convert oil into high-value chemicals and new materials that will significantly improve the quality of life of Indians.  As the world moves towards renewable energy sources and electric vehicles, Reliance has positioned itself far ahead of the curve to create new value.  At Jamnagar, we now operate with a Complexity Index of over 21.1, which is the highest globally for a refinery.  Higher complexity signifies a high degree of integration of units, feed flexibility, product manufacturing capability and, consequently, the ability to maximize margins.  Our Oils to Chemicals business achieved revenue of Rs 5.7 lakh crore, exports of Rs 2.2 lakh crore and EBITDA of Rs 52,041 crore.  We processed 68.3 million tons of crude during the year maintaining our record of over 100% operating rate.  Despite a challenging global environment, we achieved a GRM of $9.2 per barrel, maintaining a margin of $4.2 per barrel over the Singapore complex.  We derived the full benefits of Refinery Off-Gas Cracker by increasing polymer production by 18% to 5.8 MMT.  The Ethane sourcing investment achieved superior returns as we capitalized on the feedstock flexibility in a volatile environment.  All units of the Gasification complex have been safely commissioned.  The Gasification complex is tightly integrated with the refinery and petrochemical complex at Jamnagar.  Our focus is now on completing this integration, capacity utilization and efficiency.  The Butyl Rubber project with equity and technology from SIBUR of Russia, one of the global leaders in this business, is nearing completion and will be commissioned this year.  This is a great example of India-Russia cooperation.  Reliance and BP signed a Joint-venture in the petroleum retailing business.  In a significant new initiative, BP is acquiring 49% stake in our petro-retail business.  Reliance will get Rs 7,000 crore from BP for this transaction.  Dear Shareholders,  I am now delighted to make an announcement about the biggest foreign investment in the history of Reliance.  It is also among the largest foreign investments in India.  Saudi Aramco and Reliance have agreed to form a long-term Partnership in our Oil to Chemicals (O2C) division.  In terms of the understanding between the parties, Saudi Aramco will invest in Reliance for a 20% stake in Oil to  Chemicals division at an Enterprise Value of US$ 75 Billion for the O2C division.  This investment by Saudi Aramco is subject to due diligence, definitive agreements, regulatory and other customary approvals.  This Partnership will cover all of RIL's Refining and Petrochemicals assets, including 51% of the Petroleum Retail JV.  Saudi Aramco will also supply 500 KBPD of Crude Oils on a long term basis to RIL's Jamnagar refinery.  This signifies perfect synergy between the world's largest oil producer and the world's largest integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex.  Since its inception, our Jamnagar refinery has been processing Saudi oil every single day for 20 years.  Now we have transformed our longstanding relationship of two decades, based on mutual trust, into a Partnership of growth potential for many more years.  I feel privileged to welcome Saudi Aramco, which is the largest business enterprise in the world.  I am grateful to the visionary leaders, Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, who have laid the foundation for strategic cooperation between India and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  3. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production  Dear Shareholders,  I am happy that the Natural Gas business will soon regain its place of pride in Reliance's value-creation strategy.  With Reliance de-emphasising its Shale Gas business in the USA, we are currently focused only on India. In our coal bed methane blocks, we are focusing on augmenting production. The Joint Venture with BP will play a major role as a producer of natural gas.  With world class deep-water infrastructure in the east coast of India, the JV is uniquely positioned to monetize over 3 trillion cubic feet of discovered resources in the KG D6 block.  Our JV has committed an investment of Rs 35,000 crore in the three deep water fields in this block.  The projects to develop these gas-fields are amongst the most complex, being executed anywhere in the world. These will commence production from the first half of 2020.  With an expected peak production of one billion cubic feet per day, equivalent to nearly 30% of India's current indigenous gas production, the JV will emerge as a major contributor to India's energy security.  	 Reliance Jio &ndash; Our Digital Services Initiative  Dear Friends,  Now, I turn to the youngest member of the Reliance family &ndash; JIO.  India is today a USD 2.5 Trillion economy.  Statistics from large economies show that nearly 3%-5% of their GDP is spent on digital services.  Even at 3% this translates to a potential Indian digital service spend of nearly 5 LAKH CRORES annually.  I believe that JIO is ideally placed to earn a significant proportion of this technology-driven value-addition to our economy.  Friends,  JIO was founded with a vision to bring DIGITAL LIFE to every Indian.  And this vision was built on TWO pillars:  The FIRST was DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY, where JIO would connect EVERY-ONE, EVERY-PLACE and EVERYTHING with the highest quality and affordability.  And the SECOND was to build DIGITAL PLATFORMS and SOLUTIONS built to suit the unique requirements of India and Indians spanning all walks of life like entertainment, ecommerce, financial services, education, healthcare, agriculture, eGovernance and everything beyond.  Let me begin with DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY.  On 5th September this year JIO turns THREE years old.  And what an incredible THREE YEARS it has been!  In the sacred Upanishads we have the famous mantra TAMASOMA JYOTHIR GAMAYA which means lead us from darkness to light.  In a manner of speaking, before JIO, India was DATA DARK.  And now with JIO, India is DATA SHINING BRIGHT!  Friends,  Today JIO's customer base has crossed 340 million users.  And still we are signing up more than 10 million new customers EACH MONTH.  The potential for growth is immense, and HALF A BILLION customers is now well within our reach.  On behalf of the entire JIO family, thank you India for the ENORMOUS TRUST that you have placed in us.  Because of you, JIO has become NOT JUST the largest operator in India BUT ALSO the second largest single country operator in the world!  Dear Shareholders,  Your company has invested nearly Rs 3.5 LAKH CRORE towards creating a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure across  India, with the largest optical fiber footprint.  Recently we have divested about Rs 1.17 lakh crore of hard infrastructure into separate infrastructure investment trusts or InvITs to better monetize and unlock value from these assets.  Through these investments we have created world-class, legacy-free, future-proof assets all of which are fixed-mobile converged.  The core and aggregation layers of our converged network have been 5G ready since day one.  And because of our early adoption of the ongoing enhancements to LTE technology our wireless network is already 4G  PLUS.  And we can upgrade this to 5G at minimum incremental cost.  Thanks to JIO's converged network architecture we can offer even faster fixed line broadband to homes and business establishments TODAY.  Friends,  Unlike other industry players your company had the foresight to PRE-INVEST in the network assets.  And for this reason, I can report to you today that the investment cycle for Jio is now complete.  Only marginal investments in access are now required to grow capacity to meet growing demand.  This gives us tremendous OPERATING LEVERAGE and SUPERIOR RETURNS on our INVESTMENTS for years to come.  Friends,  While most of our investments are complete, we have so far fired up JUST ONE of the engines of Revenue generation for Jio namely mobile broadband.  Even with one engine Jio has been profitable from its first quarter of commercial operations.  And now we are ready to kick-start FOUR more engines of CONNECTIVITY REVENUE for Jio.  INTERNET OF THINGS or IoT all over India.  HOME BROADBAND.  ENTERPRISE BROADBAND.  And BROADBAND for SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES.  And I am glad to report that the Revenues from each of these engines will kick-in within THIS FINANCIAL YEAR ITSELF.  Let me now describe these new growth engines.  FIRST Internet of Things.  JIO has developed an innovative service on its pan-India 4G network called Narrowband Internet-of-Things or NBIoT, for short.  Using NBIoT data from billions of smart sensors whether residential, industrial or public can be collected from across  India with the highest reliability and lowest cost.  To take just one example there are over 300 million electricity meters which need to be connected digitally for real-time monitoring and for giving consumers full visibility and control of cost and quality.  And going forward each home and business premise will have dozens of connected devices.  Within another 2 years, it is estimated that there will be more than 2 Billion Connected IOT devices in our country.  Jio aims to connect at least 1 BILLION of these on JIO's IoT platform.  This translates into a Rs 20,000 CRORE PER YEAR revenue opportunity for JIO.  Jio's IoT platform will be commercially available starting 1st January, 2020.  Now the SECOND engine Home broadband.  Last year I had shared with you JIO's plans for optical-fiber-based FIXEDLINE BROADBAND service &ndash; called JIOFIBER.  Starting August 15th of last year, we invited registrations of interest from across India so that we could prioritize  JIOFIBER rollout into localities with the highest interest.  The response was simply overwhelming.  We received over 15 million registrations from nearly 1,600 towns.  And based on these registrations, we have drawn up a plan to reach 20 million residences and 15 million business establishments in these 1,600 towns.  Over the past year, we have built significant momentum in our JIOFIBER rollout and we are confident that we will complete our network rollout within the next 12 months.  During the last year we also installed JIOFIBER &ndash; on a trial basis &ndash; in nearly HALF A MILLION homes to fine-tune our services based on actual customer feedback.  And we have found that these trial homes on average are consuming more than 100 GBs per month and this usage is increasing with each passing day.  Friends,  With JIOFIBER you get lightning fast broadband speeds of up to 1 GBPS.  You get a landline phone connection, at no additional cost.  And you get a DIGITAL SET-TOP-BOX that opens up unparalleled digital experiences within your home.  ULTRA HIGH DEFINITION ENTERTAINMENT, VIRTUAL REALITY content, MULTI-PARTY VIDEO CONFERENCING, VOICE-ENABLED VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS, INTERACTIVE GAMING, HOME SECURITY and many other SMART-HOME SOLUTIONS, The digital possibilities are endless.  THEN THERE IS TELEVISION which is still at the heart of the Indian home.  Television services in India is a classic small-businesses success story, where Local Cable Operators or LCOs played a pioneering role.  In recent years, competition from DTH operators have threatened the viability of nearly 1 lakh LCOs who still operate across India.  As firm supporters of local and small businesses JIO wanted to ensure that these LCOs continued to serve their communities.  Earlier this year RIL acquired controlling stakes in three leading Cable MSOs &ndash; Hathway, DEN and GTPL who have direct relationships with over 30,000 LCOs.  Over the past months we have worked with our MSOs to upgrade their infrastructure to world-class standards.  After these upgrades, our LCO partners will now be able to offer the largest bouquet of High-Definition channels to customers with better features, reliability and customer experience than even DTH.  But, now we have gone one step further.  We have designed our JIO SET-TOP-BOX to accept the broadcast cable TV signals from our LCO partners.  So that with every JIOFIBER home all our LCO partners will continue to have a steady stream of revenue for their broadcast TV business.  We look forward to extending this partnership to all LCOs across the country.  Now For SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES.  JIOFIBER enables a powerful combination of FIXED-LINE CONNECTIVITY and CLOUD APPLICATIONS leapfrogging them from NO TECHNOLOGY to having a complete line-up of cutting-edge, plug-and-play technology enabled tools.  This will make them productive from day-one and empower them to succeed in the marketplace even against much larger enterprises.  I believe that in their success lies the recipe for sustainable growth and large-scale employment for the Indian economy.  And FINALLY, LARGE ENTERPRISES.  In the past, enterprises had no choice but to make large expenditures of time, money and effort to keep pace with technology.  Today cloud-based solutions provide out-of-the-box capabilities which are easier, faster and cheaper to adopt.  JIOFIBER and JIO's cloud solutions level the playing field for Indian enterprises enabling them to accelerate their digital transformation and compete globally using the very same technologies that are used by global majors.  Friends  Now let me turn to the obvious question.  When is JIOFIBER going to be available, and how much will it cost?  TODAY I want to ANNOUNCE that starting 5th SEPTEMBER of this year - on the THIRD anniversary of JIO's launch - we are launching JIOFIBER services on a COMMERCIAL basis.  Let me now give you a PREVIEW of the JIOFIBER tariffs.  Jio tariffs are based on FOUR strong and powerful principles.  First principle:  JioFiber will launch with a line-up of simple and easy to understand tariff plans.  On performance - the average fixed-line download speed in the US which is the most developed economy is around 90 Mbps.  In India even the most basic JIOFIBER plan STARTS WITH 100 Mbps speed and we have plans all the way up to 1 Gbps or 1000 Mbps.  This will disproportionately improve the quality of fixed-line data in India.  And on price - we are pricing our plans at less than 1/10th the global rates, to make it accessible for all.  JioFiber plans will be priced between Rs 700 to Rs 10,000 per month to suit every budget and every need.  Second:  Customers should pay for only one service, either voice or data. Not both.  With this, I am pleased to announce that voice calls from HOME to any Indian operator - mobile or fixed - will be ABSOLUTELY FREE Forever.  On Fixed-Line International Voice Calling - we are today ending the era of high international calling rates on landline.  By announcing the LOWEST FIXED LINE RATES for International Calling through 2 initiatives.  First, the default tariffs on your Jio HOME PHONE will be one-fifth to one-tenth of existing industry tariffs.  Second, we are announcing an unlimited international calling pack at ` 500 per month, to US and Canada, thereby making it easy for families to connect.  Third:  We are SUBSTANTIALLY simplifying the purchase and consumption of content.  Today many of us pay for and keep track of multiple subscriptions to multiple applications just to watch our favourite movies and shows.  This is both expensive and cumbersome.  Today, I am announcing that JIOFIBER plans will come BUNDLED with subscriptions to most leading premium OTT applications.  Also, for the first time in India, we are introducing a disruptive concept for watching NEW movies.  Premium JIOFIBER customers will be able to watch movies in their living rooms the same day these movies are released in theatres!  We call this JIO FIRST-DAY-FIRST-SHOW.  We plan to launch this service in the middle of 2020.  Fourth:  We are launching a special mobility service for our JioFiber users called JIO POSTPAID PLUS, to deliver a platinum-grade service and product experience.  Some of the unique features of this service are:  One, India's first priority SIM-setup service at home, where your connection will be moved to Jio by visiting your home.  Two, Seamless Data and Voice Connectivity across all your devices, both at home and outside.  Three, Unprecedented Family plans &ndash; one data plan for better control on GBs and sharing within your family.  Four, International roaming at a fraction of a cost with superior service experience.  Five, Phone upgrades at preferential rates.  And Six, all your home solutions on your phone.  The complete details of our tariffs will be available from 5th September 2019 on Jio.com and MyJio application.  BUT, there is ONE MORE THING.  The experience of JIOFIBER and JIO-SET-TOP-BOX really comes to life when combined with an LED TELEVISION.  So, JIOFIBER customers who opt for our annual plans which we call JIO-FOREVER plans, will get an HD OR 4K LED  TELEVISION and a 4K SET-TOP-BOX ABSOLUTELY FREE.  We are calling this the JIOFIBER WELCOME OFFER.  I invite all of you to make the most of THE JIOFIBER WELCOME OFFER and sign-up for JIOFIBER as soon as it is available in your neighbourhoods.  Friends,  Let me now move to the SECOND PILLAR of JIO DIGITAL LIFE.  DIGITAL PLATFORMS and SOLUTIONS.  Today, JIO is already a software company.  JIO has over 6000 software engineers and we are continuing to attract technology talent from across India and the world.  JIO is also investing in a growing ecosystem of technology startups.  As on date we have invested in 14 startups that embody the JIO DNA and have developed unique capabilities in their respective fields with a total of 1500 talented engineers.  This is another way we are building talent.  And on the back of this talent we are now investing in scaling-up advanced technologies in our country even ahead of the rest of the world.  Let me describe our plans for a few of these.  FIRST, Blockchain technology all over India.  Using Blockchain we can deliver unprecedented security, trust, automation and efficiency to almost any type of transaction.  This is a vital capability for India especially for modernizing our supply chains for agricultural produce and other goods which form the lifeblood of our economy.  And using Blockchain, we also have an opportunity to invent a brand-new model for data privacy where Indian data especially customer data is owned and controlled through technology by the Indian people and not by corporates, especially global corporations.  Data is wealth and Indian wealth must remain in India.  Over the next 12 months, JIO will install across India one of the largest blockchain networks in the world with tens of thousands of nodes operational on day one.  SECOND, Edge computing and Virtual and Mixed Reality content.  As you saw in the demo, the next frontier of content is immersive.  This creates exciting new possibilities for entertainment, shopping, gaming and most importantly for education.  Delivering immersive content to hundreds of millions of users requires a well-integrated solution spanning connectivity, data storage and real-time computing.  And we need to deploy such solutions at the edge of the network or in other words, closer to where our users are.  Today, JIO is setting up a pan-India Edge Computing and Content Distribution network again starting with tens of thousands of nodes.  This means that your favourite content and applications will be even nearer to you.  So even faster downloads and faster response times.  And FINALLY, CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE across India.  To leapfrog the world, it is a national imperative to develop a nation-wide cloud computing infrastructure that is both cutting-edge and affordable.  There are just a handful of companies in the world who can be considered at the cutting-edge of cloud technologies.  I want to talk to you about one such company MICROSOFT.  Today, MICROSOFT's Cloud platform AZURE is one of the world's leading cloud platforms.  Today, I am glad to announce that Jio and Microsoft have entered into a globally unique long-term alliance to accelerate the digital transformation of our country.  As part of this alliance, while Jio sets up a network of large world-class datacenters across India, Microsoft will bring its Azure cloud platform into Jio's datacenters.  When we put these two pieces together, we now have the capability to develop truly India-native solutions including Speech Recognition and Natural language understanding for all major Indian languages and dialects.  All Indian businesses now have the capacity to accelerate their digital transformations and become globally competitive.  On this VERY IMPORTANT occasion I want to welcome in our midst a very special guest to talk about this partnership.  My dear friend and the CEO of MICROSOFT &ndash; India's own Satya Nadella!  Script of Mr. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft  &ldquo;Thank you, Mukesh.  It is such an incredible time to embark upon this partnership together.  Today, digital technology is transforming every place, every industry, everything. This rapid change is being driven by massive technology shifts &ndash; across the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge:  Computing is becoming ubiquitous and distributed.  AI is being infused into every experience.  And the interaction model we have with computers is increasingly human-first, rather than device-first.  These advances are shaping the next phase of innovation, and they are creating new opportunity for people and organizations everywhere, especially in India.  At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.  Core to this mission is deep partnerships, like the one we announced today with Jio.  Our ambition is to help millions of organizations across India thrive and grow in this era of rapid technological change.  Our long-term partnership combines the power of our technology &ndash; including Azure, Azure AI and Office 365 &ndash; with Jio's connectivity and digital solutions &ndash; which as you know are among the most used and fastest-growing in the world.  Together, we will offer comprehensive technology solutions &ndash; from compute and storage, to connectivity and productivity &ndash; to SMBs everywhere in the country.  Jio and Microsoft will partner to launch new cloud datacenters in India, ensuring more organizations can access the tools and platforms they need to build their own digital capability.  Jio and Microsoft will jointly offer Office 365 so more organizations can empower their employees with a modern workplace.  And Jio and Microsoft will bring Azure Cognitive Services to more devices, creating new, breakthrough intelligent experiences, with support for 13 Indian languages and others to come.  At Microsoft, we don't celebrate technology for echnology's sake, but rather we celebrate what others are empowered to do with that technology.  And our ambition is to make all of these solutions broadly accessible and affordable so they can reach as many people and organizations in India as possible.  I'm excited to see how customers will be able to achieve more because of this partnership and I'm excited about our collective opportunity ahead.  Thank you so much.&rdquo;  Dear Friends  With Microsoft and JIO, Indian businesses can count on a partnership that will work shoulder-to-shoulder with them in their journey towards becoming digital enterprises of the future.  To further our connectivity vision of empowering digital enterprises of the future, today I want to make 2 special announcements for STARTUPS AND SMALL and MEDIUM BUSINESSES.  FIRST:  JIO is a startup built in India for India by Indians.  And we have a special place in our hearts for startups.  You may know that 80% of the cost of running a startup goes towards cloud and connectivity infrastructure.  I want to announce today that Jio is ready to take away this cost by making THE CONNECTIVITY AND CLOUD  INFRASTRUCTURE ABSOLUTELY FREE FOR BUDDING STARTUPS.  I urge all startups to register for their custom-designed package on Jio.com from 1st Jan, 2020.  JIO will also invest and financially support those startups that have the potential to address India's big needs in agriculture, healthcare, education and skill development which will boost the creation of new livelihoods.  SECOND:  Micro, small and medium businesses are the bedrock of Indian economy.  To run their business, a bundle of connectivity, productivity and automation tools costs a micro and small business between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 per month currently.  For a similar service, customers abroad pay over 1,000 Dollars per month.  Today we are taking the bold step of giving these applications along with our connectivity to small businesses for 1/10th the cost starting at Rs 1,500 per month.  Now all small business will have access to unlimited enterprise-grade voice and data services, video conferencing, security solutions, marketing and sales solutions and many more productivity tools that will help them run their business efficiently and at par with larger enterprises.  The medium and larger businesses spend even higher between ` 3 &ndash; 5 Lacs per month for which we have custom designed plans with similar value benefits.  With this step, I am certain that the two to five million micro, small and medium enterprises will propel towards prosperity and march towards creating a NEW DIGITAL INDIA.  Friends,  We are at what I call the end of the beginning of the JIO story.  We have built a robust connectivity business our first pillar with multiple growth engines that provide significant upsides.  And our second pillar digital platforms is JIO's contribution to transform India into an AI-first economy across all sectors and all walks of life.  It is my passion and conviction that New India will lead and not follow the advanced nations of the world in adopting, even creating disruptive technologies that will decide the winners and losers of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  5. Reliance Retail  Dear Shareholders,  Let me now talk about our next consumer business &ndash; the retail business.  I am proud to say that Reliance Retail has well and truly brought the Retail Revolution to India.  We are able to deliver the highest value to our customers because we have the widest geographical footprint; nationwide supply chain; technology expertise; design &amp;amp;amp; product development; and the largest assortment of goods and services.  Reliance Retail provides us with a hyper-growth platform, as the Indian consumer demands products and services which are at par with the best in the world.  It is the best proxy for the consumption story of India.  We achieved a significant milestone with our turnover crossing Rs 1,30,000 crore in the last year.  We have achieved this milestone faster than any other retail company in the world.  Our EBITDA margins are among the best globally.  The Retail business has grown phenomenally, registering a 7-fold increase in revenue and a 14-fold increase in profit in the last six years.  Our relentless focus on operating discipline has resulted in a 3-fold rise in per store productivity in the last 5 years.  We serve more than 1 lakh customers every hour, a feat no Indian retailer has been able to achieve.  Last year, we delighted over 15 crore unique customers.  We registered over 500 million footfalls last year, becoming India's preferred shopping destination.  We have expanded our footprint at a rate of 8 stores per day, opening a total of 3,000 new stores this year, higher than any other retailer globally.  Our spread of stores covers all corners of the country, with presence in nearly 7,000 towns and cities.  Over 2/3rd of our 10,415 stores are in Tier II, Tier III and Tier IV towns.  These towns are connected with a modern supply chain capable of delivering products from distribution centres spread across the country.  The unique customer insights can be leveraged to grow into a much bigger business in the next five years.  Dear Shareholders,  Here are a few more signposts of our spectacular achievements in retail.  Reliance Digital is the undisputed leader in India in consumer electronics retailing.  We sell more phones, laptops, refrigerators, TVs and ACs than any other retailer in the country.  We sold a TV every 24 seconds last year; and we sold a phone every 2 seconds.  In Grocery, we are India's largest modern trade retailer.  Reliance Retail sells nearly half of the fresh fruits and vegetables sold by the entire modern retail ecosystem in India.  We sold more than 6.4 lakh tonnes of groceries during the year.  In the fashion category, Reliance Trends is the undisputed leader.  Reliance Trends sold over four lakh garments every day last year.  With the acquisition of Hamleys, Reliance Retail has transformed into a global retailer with presence in 18 countries.  We are proud to own a global category leader in children's premium toys that we can take to other parts of the world &ndash; and we will be the first Indian company to do so.  And we continue to be the preferred partner for several international marquee brands in India.  Today, we are the only Indian retailer to be ranked in the Global 100 top retailers.  Over the next 5 years, our aim is to be amongst the world's top 20 retailers.  Dear Shareholders,  Now I want to update you on Reliance's New Commerce initiative that I spoke about last year.  New Commerce is a massive new business opportunity of USD 700 billion.  However, for Reliance, it is the greatest opportunity to promote inclusive growth and shared wealth at the bottom of India's commerce and retail pyramid.  The main purpose of New Commerce is to completely transform the unorganized retail market, which accounts for 90% of India's retail industry.  The 3 crore merchants and kirana shop owners, who generate direct and indirect livelihoods for over 20 crore people, form the backbone of India's commerce eco-system.  These highly energetic and self-motivated entrepreneurs have suffered in recent years because of their inability to invest in technology and infrastructure.  In the true Reliance ethos, we are working towards enriching and empowering them with our end-to-end digital and physical distribution stack.  For this, we are deploying blockchain, IOT, AI and other new technologies on a pan-India basis.  This tech-enabled partnership will link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands and consumers.  By removing inefficiencies and value destruction in today's market ecosystem, New Commerce will transfer significant new value to consumers, producers and merchants.  Our merchant Point of Sale (POS) Solution &ndash; Jio Prime Partner POS &ndash; is integral to our plan to create an ecosystem around small merchants.  This user friendly digital platform is designed for inventory management, customer relationship management, financial services and other services.  This will modernise even the smallest neighbourhood kirana shop to become a future-ready digitized store.  During the last year, we have made significant progress in developing and testing our merchant technology platforms.  Our beta trials with thousands of merchants across multiple locations in the country established the premise of New Commerce with significant increase in sales and improvement in margins for the participating merchants.  We are now getting ready to roll out the platform at a larger scale.  Reliance's New Commerce platform thus represents the Digital Symbiosis of Big and Small Enterprises.  I believe that the Small must not only survive, but also thrive in New India.  6. Media and Entertainment  Let me turn to our media and entertainment business.  We have created one of India's largest broadcast portfolios and digital media offerings across platforms.  Our 72 television channels reach 800 million Indians, representing more than 95% of the TV-viewing universe.  Our News18-branded TV news platform is the largest by regional footprint, ratings or revenue.  Our entertainment portfolio, led by Colors, has grown in stature, with its mass and niche offerings.  Network 18 is among the top digital media players in the country, with one in four Indians on our websites or apps, across Moneycontrol, Firstpost, Voot, News18.com and many others.  7. Reliance Foundation  Dear Shareholders,  Reliance Foundation's aim is to help change lives and empower India by providing the largest platform for development initiatives.  As the Foundation enters its 10th year, I am humbled that we have touched the lives of more than 29 million people across the country.  I would like to congratulate Nita for her leadership in building India's largest philanthropic organisation.  Through our Rural Transformation programmes, we have improved the livelihoods of over 8 million people across 19,000 villages.  Our efforts in rural India support key national priorities like ensuring water security and doubling farmers' income using technology innovations.  Last year, our Foundation provided relief and rehabilitation to people impacted by natural calamities in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.  As we speak our teams are involved in relief and rehabilitation efforts in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala.  As a mark of respect to the Pulwama martyrs, we have assumed full responsibility for the education of their children, and the livelihood of their families.  Responding to Honourable PM's appeal, we stand committed to support the people of Jammu &amp;amp;amp; Kashmir and Ladakh in all their developmental needs.  Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital continues to deliver excellent results in patient care.  Last year, clinical capabilities in newer areas were developed in collaboration with doctors from Sloan Kettering,  Gleneagles Hospital in Singapore and Guy's Hospital in London.  Innovative new programmes in liver transplant and paediatric cardiovascular surgeries were also initiated for the first time in Mumbai.  Reliance has received Letter of Intent from the Government to set up Jio Institute under the Institute of Eminence framework.  We are committed to making this a world-class institution for higher-education and research.  Our Education and Sports for All (ESA) initiatives have reached more than 18 million youth across multiple sporting disciplines.  I will also like to congratulate Nita and Akash for their leadership to Mumbai Indians, who won their fourth IPL title this year &ndash; the only team to do so.  Our Foundation aspires to make a greater impact to the nation through partnerships, digital technology and direct action.  I seek your blessings to make this happen.  8. Value Creation Roadmap  Let me now summarise the value creation roadmap for your company, as we are coming to the end of our largest capital expenditure cycle.  Your company has invested Rs 5.4 lakh crore in the last 5 years for:  1. Expanding and strengthening a world class Oil to Chemicals business which has a unique combination of scale, complexity and resilience to business cycles;  Our Oil to Chemicals business, in partnership with Saudi Aramco, is best placed to pursue growth and value creation, while adding substantial value to the feedstock provided by our strategic partner.  2. Creating the world's largest, converged, greenfield, legacy-free data network company and digital services company; Jio has grown into the proxy for tech and digital services for India.  It has strong operating leverage and is best placed to win in the emerging ` 5 lakh crore Indian digital opportunity.  3. Building the largest and fastest growing retail company in India.  Reliance Retail has created an unbeatable pole position in the US$ 80 billion organised retail market in India.  In addition, Reliance Retail has built the capabilities to address the US$ 700 billion unorganised retail opportunity, which we call New Commerce.  This is a unique business model we are building in partnership with millions of small merchants and kirana shops, so that they can be empowered to serve the Indian customers.  Together, Reliance Retail and New Commerce will become the proxy to India's consumption story.  The India-centric upstream business in partnership with BP will bring over 3 tcf of gas resources to production starting next year.  This will generate EBITDA in excess of US$ 1 billion annually for over a decade.  We also have large and valuable real estate assets; and have a strong portfolio of financial investments.  Your company has thus built a unique portfolio of world class and extremely valuable assets in the fastest growing economy in the world.  Each of our best-in-class businesses is contributing to the transformation of our country, while also creating enormous societal value.  At the end of our largest capital expenditure cycle, we continue to be rated AAA for domestic debt and two notches above Sovereign rating for international debt - the highest ratings for any industrial company in India.  Our consolidated EBITDA in the last year was ` 92,656 crore.  On the strength of our existing and new growth engines, I am very confident that we can grow this by 15% annually over the next 5 years.  Dear Shareholders,  Last year, we transferred our telecom infrastructure assets to two separate infrastructure trusts for a consideration of Rs 1.25 lakh crore with the intention of raising this money from large global institutional investors.  We have received strong interest and commitments from reputed global investors and are confident that these transactions will be completed by the end of this Financial Year.  Post this, we ended last year with net debt of Rs 154,478 crore.  We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company within the next 18 months that is by 31st March 2021.  1. Our transactions with Saudi Aramco and BP will create win-win relationships, generating significant strategic value for our partners.  We expect to complete these transactions within this financial year subject to definitive agreements, due diligence, regulatory and other customary approvals. The commitments from these two transactions are about Rs 1.1 lakh crore.  2. We have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in our consumer businesses, Jio and Reliance Retail.  We will induct leading global partners in these businesses in the next few quarters, and move towards listing of both these companies within the next five years.  3. We will also evaluate value unlocking options for our real estate and financial investments.  With these initiatives, I have no doubt that your company will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world.  As we achieve our zero net-debt target, I assure you my dear shareholders that we will reward you abundantly through higher dividends, periodic bonus issues and other means, and at a more accelerated pace than any time in our history.  9. Conclusion  Dear Shareholders,  In conclusion, I also wish to address my dear countrymen, because they are the biggest and most important stakeholders of Reliance.  My father, Dhirubhai Ambani, created Reliance because his primary motivation was to create wealth and value for India and her people.  He was absolutely clear in his vision that promoters, shareholders and employees would get their share of value only after our businesses have created maximum societal value.  This is also my vision.  And it will remain the unchanging vision of Reliance.  The trust and confidence of the people of India in Reliance is growing stronger with each passing year, because we have remained faithful to our Founder Dhurubhai's vision and core values.  This relationship of trust is our most precious asset.  A single example is enough to illustrate this truth.  In just three years, as many as 34 crore Indians have put their trust in Jio because of our uncompromising commitment to propel India to digital leadership.  Nothing gives me greater happiness than to see that Reliance is now making a bigger and more positive impact, on the lives of more Indians -- in multiple ways through business and philanthropy.  And nothing gives me greater inspiration in my work, each single day, than my conviction that the New India that our children will grow up in, will be happier, healthier, wealthier, prouder and more caring than ever before.  10. Acknowledgements  I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, lenders, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.  I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their unanimous support and immense encouragement.  I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly to create and sustain a world-class enterprise.  Thank you.

He was speaking at the 42nd&nbsp;annual general meeting of Reliance Industries in Mumbai on August 12.  The three projects will help reverse the falling gas output from what was once the biggest gas-producing block in the country.  In July, the two partners had announced investment sanction for development of their deepest natural gas discovery in the KG-D6 block.  The MJ, or D-55, gas find will be developed in sync with the previously approved 'R-Series' and the Satellites Cluster development to add 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas production in phases.

The company in its latest annual report said the Jamnagar supersite ranks first in the world in complexity barrels, aided by best-in-class refinery and petrochemicals integration.  Complexity index (CI) designates the capabilities of a refinery to upgrade the lowest quality crude to the highest quality refinery products, including fuels and petrochemicals.  &amp;quot;Complexity index of Jamnagar supersite, as per KBC, a global refinery consultant, has increased from earlier 12.7 to 21.1 or a 66.1 per cent boost with the start-up of Jamnagar expansion projects, including ROGC and downstream units, Paraxylene complex and Petcoke Gasification complex,&amp;quot; it said. This gives the firm an &amp;quot;ability to run a wide basket of crudes&amp;quot;.  The company has two refineries at Jamnagar -- a 33 million tonnes a year older unit that caters to the domestic market and a 35.2 million tonnes only-for-exports unit. Its total refining capacity of 68.2 million tonnes is just a shade lower than 69.2 million tonnes capacity with the country's biggest oil firm, Indian Oil Corp (IOC).  Commenting on the annual report, Morgan Stanley said the company has a vision of being one of the top five petrochemical companies in the world.  &amp;quot;RIL refinery processed about 170 different crudes, up from 150 during the past two years,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;RIL's refinery sales volume declined (to 54 per cent from 60 per cent), as domestic and captive sales increased.&amp;quot;  In 2018-19, RIL's refining margin at $9.2 per barrel remained relatively strong even in a dynamic volatile market.  &amp;quot;RIL maintained a significant premium of $4.3 a barrel over the benchmark Singapore complex margins. RIL's superior refining margins are a result of superior product slate, robust risk management, and higher secondary unit throughputs,&amp;quot; the company said in its annual report.  Among the refineries started in recent years, state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd's Bina refinery in Madhya Pradesh has CI of close to 10 while Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd's (HPCL) Bhatinda unit has a complexity of 12. IOC's latest refinery at Paradip in Odisha has a complexity factor of 12.2, making it capable of processing cheaper, higher sulphur and heavy crude.  In January 2018, RIL announced the successful commissioning of the world's first-ever Refinery Off-Gas Cracker (ROGC) complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum capacity. The ROGC complex uses off-gases from Jamnagar refineries as feedstock, helping RIL emerge as one of the most efficient producers of polymers in the world.  Petcoke gasification project, one of the largest clean initiatives in the world, uniquely turned Jamnagar refineries 'bottom-less' by converting low-value petroleum coke into syngas (synthesis gas).  &amp;quot;One of the most complex projects, it has integrated 83 process units with refineries and other downstream units operating in extreme conditions, with temperatures ranging from (-)190&deg;C to (+)1,480&deg;C, and pressure fluctuating from vacuum to 120 standard atmosphere,&amp;quot; the annual report said.  Reliance's refining complex, which is the largest in the world, is designed to operate solely on desalinated seawater, thus making freshwater resources from lakes and rivers available for communities to use.

Gross refining margin (GRM) at $8.1 per barrel was a miss on street expectations.  Jio continues to meet expectations in terms of its quarterly performance. Despite slower pace of customer addition, strong competition and falling average revenue per user (ARPU), it maintained its operating margin in Q1 FY20. Brookfield's investment remains the key highlight, which would enable lowering debt.  Retail business came out with strong performance and growth in revenue as well as margins. The segment's increasing contribution to the overall profits is noteworthy.      Key Positives  -Reliance Retail reported a stellar 47.5 percent growth YoY (year-on-year) in its top-line. This was largely led by 265 new stores during the quarter. Operational efficiencies led to margins improving by 60 basis points YoY. In core retail (excluding petro retail and Jio stores), the margin was 8.9 percent.  -Jio witnessed 5.16 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in its net revenue which was at Rs 11,679 crore. Growth returned on the back of net addition of 24.5 million subscribers in the quarter. Jio's subscriber-base stood at 331.3 million.  -What came as a surprise was Jio's 114 bps expansion in its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin on QoQ basis.    -The refining and marketing business saw a decent uptick in revenue driven largely by higher throughput. Improvement in gasoline margins was a positive surprise for the segment. Margins in diesel and airline fuel remained largely flat.  Key negative  -While Jio's subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of growth moderated primarily due to base effect and increased competition.  -Strong competition and offers by Jio led to ARPU decline of 3.3 percent on QoQ basis and came at Rs 122 per month.  -GRM at $8.1 per barrel was lower than last quarter as well as the street&rsquo;s expectation. However it was in line with the global weakness in refinance margins and the challenging global environment for the segment.    -Performance of the petchem segment remained under pressure, with dip in revenue due to decline in volumes. Lower Price realisations in Paraxylene and dip in margins in polyethylene negatively impacted the segment&rsquo;s profits.  Outlook  Results were broadly in line with our expectations barring the weakness in the petchem and refining performance. However, we take a cue from the CFO's comments that segmental margins and product cracks are already on a rebound which should help improve performance in the upcoming quarters. Singapore benchmark GRMs in the current month have seen an uptick.  Jio continues to be core focus for expansion and is expected to drive the revenue growth in the coming quarters. We believe Jio would continue its strong show, going forward, on the back of its strategy of deeper and wider market penetration that would continue to disrupt the entire value chain. Further, Jio continues to build capacity in line with increasing data traffic which crossed the 10 Exabyte mark during the quarter. Additionally, its JioGigaFiber services is in its final stages, and early signs have been very encouraging. The company is gradually rolling out enterprise services as well.  An agreement has been entered into with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its affiliates for an investment of Rs 25,215 crore into Tower InvIT. This will be used to repay existing financial liabilities of Jio.  We expect the Brick-and-mortar store expansion to continue across all verticals. Impetus is expected to be laid on tier 3 and 4 regions, where the headroom for growth is huge. Nevertheless, on an already high base, revenue growth may moderate from a quarter-on-quarter perspective. A formal announcement pertaining to the launch of an all-encompassing e-commerce platform is awaited.  We remain optimistic about the retail vertical's revenue growth potential on the back of a large store network pan-India, growing footfalls, adequate warehousing facilities and presence across diversified product categories. However, it&rsquo;ll be important to keep an eye on how the margin trajectory would pan out. This would be predominantly dependent on benefits of scale in terms of availability of wide assortments, product launches, promotions, and merchandise sourcing.    It is also noteworthy that the company is steadily transforming from a commodity driven business to a more consumer oriented business with increasing contribution of the consumer segments in its EBITDA.&nbsp; The contribution of Reliance Retail to Reliance Industries&rsquo; consolidated revenue and EBIT has been steadily increasing.    We believe this would be value accretive in times to come. Initiatives to reduce leverage is also positive for long term.

The profit tax, however, was down 2.5 percent when compared to the March quarter number of Rs 10,362 crore.  Consolidated net revenue grew by 13.2 percent from a quarter ago to Rs 1.57 lakh crore, which was much higher than CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 1.43 lakh crore.

Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  &amp;quot;Downstream businesses delivered resilient performance in an environment of slower demand growth and incremental supplies. The performance reflects the benefits of deep refining and petrochemicals integration, chain economics and feedstock flexibility,&amp;quot; he added.  Earnings on most parameters beat analyst estimates barring gross refining margin, which came in at $8.10 a barrel for the quarter (the lowest level since Q3FY15) against Street expectations of around $8.50 a barrel.

In the telecom business, Reliance Jio registered a healthy growth with profit growing 6.1 percent sequentially to Rs 891 crore. It also reported a subscriber base of 331.3 million in the first quarter against analyst expectations of 306.7 million. The subscriber base was 332.5 million in the quarter ended March 2019.

The refining &amp;amp;amp; petrochemical volumes, and Jio &amp;amp;amp; retail businesses are expected to be strong and will drive revenue growth on a sequential basis for the company.  However, there could be some pressure on consolidated margin from Jio &amp;amp;amp; petchem segments, which may impact profitability a bit in Q1 but standalone operating income is likely to see sequential increase on higher refining margin, crude throughput and petchem volumes, brokerages feel.  Gross refining margin is expected to be higher at $8.5 a barrel in Q1FY20 against $8.2 a barrel in Q4FY19, which implies a premium of $5 per barrel over Singapore GRM, said Motilal Oswal. It expects refining throughput to grow 9 percent QoQ and petchem volume to rise 11 percent QoQ but petrochemical segment is expected to suffer due to reduced product margins.  &amp;quot;With core business bearing the periodic suffering, positive developments in the telecom and retail segments should drive growth further for the company,&amp;quot; the brokerage said.  Singapore GRM for the quarter stood at $3.5 par barrel, down around 42 percent YoY and up around 8 percent QoQ, due to an improvement in gasoline cracks.  &amp;quot;We expect RIL to report a marginal QoQ increase in standalone EBITDA led by modestly higher refining margins at $8.5 a barrel and increase in crude throughput and petchem volumes, which will be partly offset by moderation in overall petchem margins,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  The brokerage expects consolidated EBITDA to decline QoQ, as higher standalone and retail EBITDA will be offset by lower Jio EBITDA due to accounting of capacity cost pertaining to Jio's fiber/tower InvITs in lieu of interest and depreciation cost earlier.  Reliance management is confident of 7 percent volume growth in both polymer and polyester business, which will benefit Reliance in Indian markets, hence petrochemicals business is expected to remain buoyant in Q1 FY20, Narnolia said.  The brokerage also added that Jio has successfully integrated Hathway and Den network and is now rolling out JioGiga Fiber in 1,100 cities in India targeting 5 crore JioGiga Homes in the first phase.  Key issues to watch out for would be GRM, petrochemical margin, telecom subscribers, future capex, and interest cost &amp;amp;amp; depreciation.  Reliance Retail has added 510 stores during Q4FY19 and 2,829 stores during the FY19. &amp;quot;Further the company is adding 120 new outlets every quarter which gives us strong revenue growth visibility for next couple of years. Retail being the high margin business is expected to contribute significantly in operating profits of the company,&amp;quot; Narnolia said.  Jio has added 307 million subscribers to its network by the end of March 2019. Company&rsquo;s aggressive efforts to increase subscriber base restricts ARPU to Rs 126 in March quarter.

BP's Chief Executive (Upstream) Bernard Looney said the partners are also discussing the development of natural gas found in Mahanadi basin, off the Odisha coast.  &amp;quot;Together we are spending up to $5 billion or Rs 35,000 crore in three gas development projects in the KG-D6 block and together we are expected to bring about one billion cubic feet per day of new domestic gas on stream by 2022,&amp;quot; he said here.  The three projects will help reverse the falling gas output from what was once the biggest gas-producing block in the country.  Last month, the two partners had announced investment sanction for development of their deepest natural gas discovery in the KG-D6 block. The MJ, or D-55, gas find will be developed in sync with the previously approved 'R-Series' and the Satellites Cluster development to add 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas production in phases.  The two partners also exploring ways of &amp;quot;economically&amp;quot; developing discoveries in the NEC-25 block in the Mahanadi basin and building pipelines for transportation of the gas, Looney said.  The three projects will develop a total of about 3 Tcf (trillion cubic feet) of discovered gas resources. R-Cluster will be first to come on stream, delivering gas in the second half of 2020-21 fiscal. The second set is called the Satellite Cluster. MJ is the third of these fields.  Reliance, which is the operator of KG-D6 with 60 per cent stake, has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3) -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.  The output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.3 mmscmd in the January-March quarter. MA field ceased to produce last year.  BP holds 30 per cent stake in the block while the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources of Canada.  Besides MJ, four deepsea satellite gas discoveries -- D-2, 6, 19 and 22 -- are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block. These six fields are called Satellite development.  The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find.  According to Looney, India is expected to overtake China as the largest growth market for energy in the mid-2020s and its primary energy demand will increase two-and-a-half times until 2040.  &amp;quot;India has a natural gas base with a potential to meet 50 per cent of anticipated demand for gas through to 2050. Natural gas burns at half of the emission of coal for power generation and offers significant benefits for air quality. In renewables, there are large untapped solar and wind resources with a potential to be utilised at a cost which is increasingly competitive with hydrocarbons,&amp;quot; he said.

",,"Business, Market news, R-Cluster development, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/reliance-to-start-gas-productionr-cluster2nd-halffy21_12398561.html,"Reliance Industries has stated that it will start natural gas production from R-Cluster gas field in the flagging KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal from the second half of the 2020-21 fiscal.  Reliance and its partner BP Plc of UK had in June 2017 announced an investment of Rs 40,000 crore in the three sets of discoveries to reverse the flagging production in KG-D6 block. These finds were expected to bring a total 30-35 million cubic metres (1 billion cubic feet) of gas a day onstream, phased over 2020-22.  R-Cluster will be first to come on stream.  &amp;quot;R-Cluster development is on track for first gas in 2H FY21,&amp;quot; Reliance said in an investor presentation after its fourth-quarter earnings.  Four of the planned six wells that would produce gas from the field have been completed and the fifth one is being drilled currently, it said adding first offshore installation campaign is underway and is expected to be completed in Q1 FY20.  The second set is called the Satellite Cluster for which all major orders have been committed and engineering work is in progress. &amp;quot;Manufacturing of components of Subsea Production System (SPS) has commenced,&amp;quot; it said.  For MJ, the third of these fields, bids for major long lead items such as drilling tangibles and FPSO is underway, Reliance said adding a rig has already been committed for drilling of wells on the field.  Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA - the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.  The output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic metres per day in March 2010 to 1.8 mmscmd in the January-March quarter, the presentation said.  MA field ceased to produce last year.  &amp;quot;Currently, D1-D3 field is producing and all efforts are being made to extend the life of the field,&amp;quot; the company said in the presentation.  Reliance is the operator of the block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada has the remaining 10 per cent.  MJ gas find is located about 2,000 metres directly below the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields in the KG-D6 block and is estimated to hold a minimum of 0.988 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of contingent resource.  Besides MJ-1, four deepsea satellite gas discoveries -- D-2, 6, 19 and 22 -- are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block.  The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find.  The government had in 2012 approved a $1.529 billion plan to produce 10.36 mmscmd of gas from four satellite fields of block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) by 2016-17. The four fields have 617 billion cubic feet of reserves and can produce gas for eight years.  However, the companies did not begin the investment citing uncertainty over gas pricing.  After the government allowed a higher gas price for yet-to-be-developed gas finds in difficult areas like the deep sea, RIL and BP decided to take up their development.  RIL-BP have kept the $3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, which was approved in August 2013. About 12.9 mmscmd of gas for 13 years can be produced from D-34 discovery, which is estimated to hold recoverable reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet.  Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.

GRMs contracted in line with global weakness; maintained better premium vs. regional benchmark.  Jio maintained operating margin despite slowdown in customer additions and ARPU.  Retail displayed a better set of operating margins.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Reliance Industries (RIL) reported a mixed set of numbers wherein traditional businesses (petchem and refining) were weak, but largely in line with global trends. The consumer businesses were the saviour. Margins in retail improved and Jio&rsquo;s quarterly performance remains robust. Despite the slower pace of customer addition, strong competition and falling ARPU (average revenue per user), Jio maintained its operating margin in Q4 FY19.      Key Positives:  Retail sales (19 percent of overall) surged 51.6 percent YoY primarily on the account of store additions. Sequentially, sales growth had moderated to 3.1 percent QoQ. A key highlight of the result has been margin improvement in retail business to 4.7 percent in Q4 (vs. 3 percent in FY18) on account of operating leverage.  Pls also read: Reliance Retail could be worth Rs 3.75 lakh crore, or half of RIL's mcap  Jio (part of digital services; 7 percent of sales) witnessed a 7 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in its net revenue to Rs 11,106 crore. The growth was driven by the net addition of 26.6 million subscribers during the quarter. With this, Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base has expanded to 306.7 million.  Despite strong competition and offers by Jio, ARPU dipped 2.9 percent QoQ to Rs 126.2 per month. Jio maintained its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin at 39 percent on a QoQ basis.    Key Negatives  Traditional businesses, particularly refining (46 percent of overall), witnessed a weak set of numbers that reflect global trends. The segment posted sharp decline in revenues sequentially due to a planned shutdown. Further, weak product cracks adversely impacted GRMs. While GRM was better than the regional metric (Singapore GRM -$5/bbl), premium tapered off in Q4.   Further, petrochemicals business (22 percent of overall) sequential performance was a disappointment. However, it witnessed a 11.3 percent improvement in sales due to better pricing and realizations for PTA (Purified terephthalic acid), Paraxylene and Polypropylene. This helped in partially offsetting the weakness in other petrochemicals which were weighed down by the higher supplies from new US capacities.  While Jio&rsquo;s subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of the growth moderated primarily due to base effect and increased competition. Interest cost outlay increased by 18.6 percent leading to a flat growth in profit-after-tax (PAT), lower than the 18.6 percent QoQ growth in EBITDA.  Key observation: Armaco &amp;amp;amp; RIL &ndash; Tale of two transitions  While there was no official comment on the media report that Armaco is interested in 25 percent stake in refining and petrochemical business, such a possibility cannot be ruled out.  Armaco has been looking for strengthening its presence in the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas downstream businesses in recent times. Earlier this week, Armaco bought a minority stake (17 percent worth $1.2 billion in the Hyundai&rsquo;s oil refining unit in Korea.) Last month, Armaco bought a 70 percent stake for roughly $69 billion in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s petro-chem giant &ndash; SABIC. In India itself Saudi Aramco is working with other OMCs to develop a mega refinery complex in Maharashtra. A possible investment in RIL&rsquo;s refining business could be a step towards further diversification making it a conglomerate having multi continent presence.  For RIL, this step can possibly mean refueling itself with ammunition to take on competition in the retail, telecom and digital businesses. Remember, RIL&rsquo;s foray in recent years has been in territories dominated by global giants - Amazon, Walmart, Netflix and Alibaba.&nbsp; As the peers have strong insights and investment appetite for reach and content, there might be greater need for investments particularly when the confluence of telecom, communication and entertainment intensifies.  Outlook:  Results were broadly as per our expectation barring the performance of refining. However, we take our cue from the CFO&rsquo;s comments that segmental margins and product cracks are already on a rebound.  Jio continues to be core focus for expansion and is expected to drive the revenue growth in the coming quarters. We believe Jio would continue its stellar run, going forward, on the back of its strategy of deeper and wider market penetration (with over 1 million retailers for customer acquisition and selling prepaid recharges) that would continue to disrupt the entire value chain. The company is also making further inroads through various strategic tie-ups and partnerships (Disney, DEN, and Hathaway) and roll-out of new services (JioGigaFiber) in 1,600 cities.  Further we view the growing contribution of Reliance Retail and Jio at the EBITDA level&nbsp;as transformational. Currently both these segments contribute nearly 25 percent of EBITDA, which was 13 percent a year back and hardly 2 percent in 2015.  At a strategic level, business transition from a low multiple commodity business to consumer oriented business should be value accretive. So far, this move has been funded through debt and cash flows from traditional business. The competitive landscape may make it imperative to look for other avenues of funding to grow these businesses. However, it is noteworthy that company&rsquo;s recent attempts to manage debt levels have helped in keeping debt to equity metric at a comfortable level of 0.67x.    A back of the envelope check on the SOTP (sum of the parts) valuation suggest that even at a conservative multiples medium term growth potential is not fully priced in.

This was driven by a 19.4 percent increase in quarterly revenue&nbsp;to Rs 1.54 lakh crore.  The company attributed the&nbsp;robust revenue performance to&nbsp;strong growth in its retail and digital services businesses which grew by 51.6 percent and 61.6&nbsp;percent, respectively. Higher petrochemical volumes also contributed to growth in revenue, the company said.  Quarterly EBITDA was at Rs 20,832 crore, up 12.7 percent YoY, and operating margin stood at 15.02 percent. The company said&nbsp;the&nbsp;growth in operating profit was led by strong performance in the petrochemicals, retail and digital&nbsp;businesses.  The company's board has recommended a dividend of Rs 6.50 per equity share of Rs 10 each for the financial year ended March 31, 2019.  Q4&nbsp;revenue from the petrochemicals segment increased 11.3% YoY to Rs 42,414 crore ($6.1 billion) mainly due to the increase in price realizations and volumes in PTA, PP, and Paraxylene.  Petrochemicals segment EBIT came in at Rs 7,975 crore, up 23.9% YoY as compared to Rs 6,435 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.  Petrochemical segment recorded EBIT margin of 18.8% as against 16.9% in Q4FY18 aided by strength in PX margins.  The company's Q4 gross refining margin (GRM) came in at $8.2/bbl against&nbsp;$8.8 a barrel reported in the December quarter of FY19, and $11/bbl in Q4FY18.

However, weak refining segment, lower throughput and stronger rupee may drag standalone earnings.  &amp;quot;We model RIL's consolidated net income to increase modestly by 1 percent QoQ to Rs 10,340 crore (EPS of Rs 17.4) in Q4FY19 led by an increase in EBITDA from Jio and retail, which will offset lower standalone contribution,&amp;quot; Kotak said.  On a consolidated basis, Motilal Oswal expects Reliance to report 6 percent sequential growth in Q4 profit.  In case of standalone business, Kotak expects RIL to report 3 percent QoQ decline in net income at Rs 8,620 crore dragged by sharply lower refining margins, which will be partly mitigated by improvement in LLDPE, PVC and polyester margins.  Prabhudas Lilladher also expects standalone profit to fall 5 percent QoQ.  The&nbsp;gross refining margins (GRMs) for the quarter ended March 2019&nbsp;are expected to decline due to sharp fall in spreads for gasoline &amp;amp;amp; diesel, refinery shutdown (108 percent utilisation) and lower light-heavy crude differentials.  According to Motilal Oswal, refining throughput may decline 7 percent and gross refining margin may fall to $8 a barrel against $8.8 a barrel in Q3FY19.  Emkay expects RIL's GRM to be $8.2 a barrel, down 7 percent QoQ, while petchem earnings should see a 4-5 percent fall QoQ on weaker margins.  Key segments, which expect to drive growth for the company, are retail and telecom.  &amp;quot;Earnings of Retail and Jio should continue to grow at 8-10 percent QoQ. We expect 307 million subscribers and Rs 129 ARPU (average revenue per user) for Jio with Rs 4,500 crore EBITDA,&amp;quot; Emkay said.  Kotak, which also assumes ARPU at Rs 129 per month, expects Jio's reported EBITDA (15 percent growth at Rs 4,655 crore) and net profits (25 percent growth at Rs 1,035 crore) to increase sharply QoQ supported by robust 32 million addition to subscriber base to 312 million by end-March 2019.  Key issues to watch for would be GRM, petrochemical margins, telecom subscribers and future capex.

In a statement, RIL said its Singapore-incorporated subsidiary Reliance Ethane Holding Pte Ltd (REHPL) has signed &amp;quot;binding definitive agreements for a strategic investment by MOL&amp;quot; and an unnamed strategic minority investor in six limited liability companies.  REHPL owns these six limited liability companies which are special purpose vehicles that own the Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs).  It did not give financial details of the deal.  &amp;quot;Transaction closing is subject to regulatory approvals. Post-closing, SPVs shall be jointly controlled by REHPL and MOL,&amp;quot; the statement said.  Reliance imports some 1.6 million tonne of ethane from the US to replace natural gas and naphtha as feedstock at its petrochemical plants in western India.  Use of ethane, a natural gas component that is produced in large volumes in North America after the shale gas revolution, has reduced the company's petrochemicals feedstock cost by about 30 per cent.  It in 2017 began receiving consignment or cargo of ethane from the US. VLECs are used to transport liquefied ethane from the US to the Gujarat Chemical Port Terminal Company at Dahej in Gujarat.  Reliance, which used 2.5 million tonne a year of naphtha as feedstock in petrochemical crackers, has contracted ethane supplies for more than 20 years from the US. Ethane reduced naphtha usage by 5,00,000 tonne.  Ethane is used as feedstock in the company's crackers in Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat and Nagothane in Maharashtra.  Reliance had in 2014 ordered building of six VLECs at Samsung Heavy Industries' shipyards in Korea. Japan's biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines will manage and operate the ships for RIL.  &amp;quot;Given MOL is currently the operator of all the six VLECs, investment by MOL will deepen our relationship with them and ensure continued safe and efficient operations of the VLECs.  &amp;quot;We welcome MOL as a strategic partner into the SPVs as they move beyond the current operator role to the joint owner and operator role in the SPVs,&amp;quot; P M S Prasad, Executive Director, RIL, said.  Takeshi Hashimoto, Member of the Board, Executive Vice President, MOL said, the investment would enable MOL to add six unique VLECs, which the company has been operating for some time now, as owners to its existing fleet of over 850 vessels.  These vessels include LNG carrier, other tankers, dry bulkers, car carriers, ferries, and coastal RoRo ships and cruise ships, Hashimoto added.  &amp;quot;MOL has detailed knowledge about these assets having supervised the construction and delivery of the six VLECs and subsequently operating them since their delivery. We are therefore happy and look forward to using this strategic opportunity to be a joint owner and to significantly strengthen our existing relationship with Reliance,&amp;quot; he said.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

If talks with the Chinese owner succeed, the 259-year-old brand will end up being the plaything of Reliance Retail, India&rsquo;s largest retailer, multiple sources involved in the negotiations told Moneycontrol News.  The purchase of Hamleys, which has its flagship store on London&rsquo;s Regent Street, will illustrate the growing international ambition of Reliance Retail, which has a target of growing at 30% every year for a decade.  Reliance Retail is owned by Reliance Industries Ltd, India&rsquo;s largest company by market value. The Network 18 group, the publisher of Moneycontrol, is controlled by RIL  &amp;quot;Due diligence for the deal is at an advanced stage,&amp;quot; said one of the sources cited above, adding, &amp;quot;Reliance Retail is aggressively pursuing the deal.&amp;quot;  Hamleys, which began life as &lsquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark in London in 1760, counts the royal family of Saudi Arabia among its loyal customers. In recent years, though, it has been struggling due to uncertainty over Brexit and softening UK consumer confidence. It reported a loss of 12 million pounds in 2017 and a 2.5 percent decline in annual revenues to 66.3 million pounds. However, it is still a dominant player in the $11 billion worldwide toy industry even as rivals like Target, Walmart, Amazon and Kohl&rsquo;s are snapping at its heels.  A source said the acquisition, if successful, will help expand Reliance Retail&rsquo;s portfolio. &ldquo;Reliance (Retail) can scale up Hamley&rsquo;s business with its capabilities in supply chain management and strong distribution network.&rdquo;  Responding to an e-mail query from Moneycontrol, a Reliance Industries spokesperson said, &amp;quot;As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours. Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. We have made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance with our obligations under SEBI regulations and our agreements with the stock exchanges.&amp;quot;  Moneycontrol is awaiting an email response from C. Banner International, the promoter of Hamleys, and will update this article as soon as it gets it.  Reliance Retail already has a pan-India franchise agreement with Hamleys to merchandise its famous toys. Hamleys has around 129 stores globally, a large majority of which are under the franchise model and outside the United Kingdom, the company is present in China, Germany, Russia, India, South Africa, the Middle East and other regions.  If the deal goes through, Reliance Retail plans to increase the geographic footprint of Hamleys in India.  &amp;quot;Hamleys currently has around 50 stories in India, the plan is to ramp it up to 200 over the next three years,&amp;quot; said another source familiar with the deal.  Moneycontrol could not independently verify if there were other bidders as well for Hamley&rsquo;s.  According to a report by market research firm IMARC, the Indian toy market was worth $1.5 billion in 2018, and has grown 15.9 percent compounded annually, between 2011 and 2018. IMARC expects the market size to cross $3.3 billion by 2024, driven by a huge base of young population, and strong economic growth. The report lists Funskool, Lego, Mattel and Hasbro as the main players in the Indian toy market.  Chinese fashion conglomerate C. Banner International had acquired Hamleys for &pound;100 million in cash in 2015. Last year in October, C Banner started looking out for potential buyers for the toy maker, according to a Sky News report. Corporate finance firm Vermillion Partners was hired to negotiate with bidders, the report said.  If the deal with Reliance Retail goes through, it would be the fourth time Hamleys has changed hands since it was taken private by an Icelandic investor in 2003.  Reliance Retail has entered into tie-ups with many other marque international brands such as Diesel, Marks &amp;amp;amp; Spencers, Steve Madden and Kenneth Cole. It reported a turnover of Rs 69,198 crore for the financial year 2017-18. As on 31st December 2018, Reliance Retail operated 9,907 stores across 6400+cities with a retail area of over 21 million square feet. Earlier in January 2019, global brokerage house CLSA said the organised and combined online and the offline retail market may grow ninefold to $550 billion in 10 years and RIL's pure retail revenues may rise nearly 12-fold to $138 billion in the same period.

In some instances, an entity/businessman stepped in as a white knight and saved the target company from a hostile takeover.  Here we revisit some of those tales of India Inc.  -In 2010, Reliance Industries turned white knight for Prithvi Raj Singh Oberoi's EIH Ltd&nbsp;as Mukesh Ambani helped the company fight off a potential takeover bid by consumer goods company ITC. Ambani had picked up a 14.12 percent stake in the hotel business.  ITC had amassed close to 14.98 percent stake in the company over the years. However, it had said it would never make a hostile bid to take control of EIH. The transaction with RIL gave Oberoi enough funds to shore up a defence.  -In 2000, promoters of real estate company Gesco Corporation were facing a hostile bid by Delhi-based Abhishek Dalmia's Renaissance Estates.&nbsp;It&nbsp;bought 10 percent stake in Gesco with a low share price and launched an open offer for an additional 45 percent.  The promoters approached Mahindra Realty &amp;amp;amp; Infrastructure, who made a counter-offer for 33.5 percent of Gesco. Dalmia ultimately sold its 10.5 percent stake to the new combine of Gesco-Mahindra at a huge profit.  -In 2001, Radhakishan Damani made a hostile bid for British American Tobacco (BAT)'s VST Industries. Damani had acquired below 15 percent stake in the company. He now wanted another 20 percent stake in the company at Rs 112 per share, which was a 26 percent premium to the market price. However, cigarette company ITC stepped in as the white knight and gave a counter-offer of Rs 115 per share that went up to Rs 126 per share later.  -Pharmaceutical company Solrex had tried to make a hostile bid for K Raghavendra Rao's Orchid Chemicals &amp;amp;amp; Pharmaceuticals. It had acquired 12 percent in the company. However, Rao resisted the bid and got the support from the company's large institutional investors, which collectively held 38 percent in the company. These included Life Insurance Corporation and United Insurance Company, Macquaire Bank and Harpline.  -In 2000, Kolkata-based Arun Bajoria bought a 15 percent stake in Wadia Group's Bombay Dyeing. He threatened to make an open offer to the shareholders of the company. The Wadias turned to Ratan Tata and Keshub Mahindra to help prevent a takeover. Bajoria finally sold his shares to the Wadias for a huge profit.  -In 2007, Harish Bhasin's investment firm HB Stockholding announced an open offer to acquire 22.8 percent of DCM Shriram Industries. The firm already held a 12.87 percent stake in the company. However, promoters countered the move by issuing warrants to themselves and increased their stake.

Reliance had been supplying alkylate, diluent naphtha and other fuel to Venezuela through its U.S.-based subsidiary before Washington in late January imposed sanctions aimed at curbing the OPEC member's oil exports and ousting Socialist President Nicolas Maduro.  At least three vessels chartered by the Indian conglomerate supplied refined products to Venezuela in recent weeks, and another vessel carrying gasoil is expected to set sail to the South American nation as well, according to the sources and data.  A Reliance spokesman wrote to Reuters in an email and said: &amp;quot;Reliance is and will remain in compliance with the sanctions and shall work with the concerned authorities.&amp;quot;  He also said &amp;quot;the volume of products supplied to and crude oil imported from Venezuela have not increased.&amp;quot;  Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates subsidiaries linked to its oil and telecom businesses, among others.  The Indian market is crucial for Venezuela's economy because it has historically been the second-largest cash-paying customer for the OPEC country's crude, behind the United States.  Additional sanctions against Venezuela are possible in the future, as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has not yet tried to prevent companies based outside the United States from buying Venezuelan oil, a strategy known as &amp;quot;secondary sanctions.&amp;quot;  Refinitiv Eikon trade data shows that Reliance shipped alkylate, a component for motor gasoline, to Venezuela on vessels Torm Mary and Torm Anabel in recent weeks. Those originated in India and passed through the Suez Canal.  It also shipped a gasoline cargo using tanker Torm Troilus to Venezuela and is preparing to send 35,000 tonnes of gasoil in a vessel called Vukovar to the South American nation.  &amp;quot;Reliance is also supplying some products from its Rotterdam storage,&amp;quot; a source familiar with Reliance's operation said.  PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.  In a statement last week, Reliance said its U.S. unit has completely stopped all business with PDVSA. Reliance also halted all supply of diluents including heavy naphtha to Venezuela and does not plan to resume such sales until sanctions are lifted, according to the release.  Venezuela has overall imported some 160,000 barrels per day of fuel and diluents for its extra heavy oil output since the U.S. measures were imposed, according to PDVSA and Refinitiv data, below levels prior to the sanctions but still enough to supply gas stations and power plants.  Reliance is among the biggest buyers of Venezuelan oil, although the company has recently said it has not increased crude purchases from Venezuela. In 2012, Reliance signed a 15-year deal to buy between 300,000 to 400,000 bpd of heavy crude from PDVSA.  Ship tracking data obtained by Reuters showed that Reliance's average purchases from Venezuela were less than 300,000 bpd in 2018 and in the first two months of this year.  Venezuela continues to supply at least some oil to India. A very large crude carrier (VLCC) is anchored off Venezuela's Jose port waiting to load oil bound for India, and at least six other vessels of the same size are underway to India's Sikka and Vadinar ports, according to the Refinitiv data.  PDVSA's second-largest customer in India is Nayara Energy, partially owned by Russian energy firm Rosneft, one of PDVSA's primary allies.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

In February, the Supreme Court had ordered Anil Ambani and two directors of Reliance Communications (RCom)&mdash;the company headed by Anil--to pay Ericsson Rs 453 crore within four weeks or face a three-month jail term for contempt of court.  Earlier on March 18, Ericsson said it had received Rs 462 crore from RCom.  In a statement, RCom Chairman Anil Ambani said, &ldquo;My sincere and heartfelt thanks to my respected elder brother, Mukesh, and Nita, for standing by me during these trying times and demonstrating the importance of staying true to our strong family values by extending this timely support. I and my family are grateful we have moved beyond the past, and are deeply touched with this gesture.&rdquo;  In effect, this is the second occasion that Mukesh Ambani has come to the rescue of his brother after a public feud in 2005 which eventually culminated in the assets of the Reliance group being split among the two siblings.  In 2018, Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio Infocomm offered to buy RCom&rsquo;s wireless assets for Rs 3,000 crore, indicating that the brothers had buried their differences.  RCom, which owed around Rs 571 crore to Ericsson, including a one-time settlement of Rs 550 crore plus interest, had already deposited Rs 118 crore with the Supreme Court in February. Ericsson, which managed and operated&nbsp;RCom's network under a 2014 deal, last year approached the court over the unpaid dues.  Anil Ambani had given a personal guarantee to the Supreme Court last year, promising that Ericsson&rsquo;s dues would be cleared. However, Reliance Communications missed the first deadline of September 30. Ericsson then filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court against Anil Ambani in October. The court gave RCom time till December 15 to make the payment. RCom filed a plea for an extension of the deadline, but the court dismissed it. RCom failed to honour the second deadline as well, following which Ericsson again filed a contempt petition.

China's move to put a technical hold on the proposal was despite the terrorist outfit claiming responsibility for&nbsp;Pulwama terror attack where 40 CRPF jawans&nbsp;were killed. Angry Indians took to Twitter to talk about China's absolute lack of empathy and disregard for India's safety using the hashtag &mdash;&nbsp;#BoycottChineseProducts.  Read:&nbsp;#BoycottChineseProducts trends on Twitter as China blocks UN move to list Masood Azhar global terrorist  While a number of social media users agree that boycotting Chinese goods would be the best way to send across a message to China, what will be the impact of&nbsp;an Indian boycott of Chinese goods?  In 2017, the India-China bilateral trade reached a historic high of $84.44 billion, up 18 percent year-on-year (YoY), according to World Integrated Trade Solution data. This was notwithstanding bilateral tensions over a host of issues including the Doklam standoff, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and Beijing blocking India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).  While bilateral trade reached a new landmark, the trade deficit continues to remain high.&nbsp;India's trade deficit with China was a huge $63 billion in 2017-18, which was more than a third of the country's total trade deficit, according to&nbsp;Commerce&nbsp;Ministry data. The country's exports to China stood at $13.3 billion and imports from the country at $76.38 billion in 2017-18.  Read:&nbsp;India-China bilateral trade hits historic high of $84 bn in 2017  In 2017,&nbsp;India's trade deficit with China was $51.75 billion, registering a growth of 8.55 percent YoY.  Acknowledging the need to take steps to check the deficit, China signed three export protocols &mdash; on rice, fishmeal and tobacco &mdash; to allow imports of the three items.  If India chooses to boycott Chinese products, it may affect the imports of capital goods, machinery and electrical, chemicals, as well as intermediate and consumer goods. These imports are important for industries in India to manufacture goods, medicines as well as gadgets.    &amp;quot;India is considerable dependent on China for many of the finished products such as gadgets. If India boycotts Chinese products, it will considerably impact the country,&amp;quot; said Biswajit Dhar, Professor and Head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.  With raw materials being exported to China, the neighbouring country is able to manufacture and export its goods at such low prices owing to subsidies and support from the government. Boycotting Chinese goods would mean fewer cheap goods for consumers in India. A reduction in the imports of cheaper capital goods would also push up production costs, making products costlier, thereby, affecting the consumers.  Since India also imports a high&nbsp;number of electrical products, it would impact the prices of electrical gadgets and smartphones.&nbsp;Chinese companies such as Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus nearly control&nbsp;51 percent of India's over $8&nbsp;billion smartphone market.  Even in the power sector, India is heavily dependent on China when it comes to achieving its renewable energy target.&nbsp;India's import dependence for meeting its solar equipment demand was&nbsp;over 90 percent in past three financial years, Power and New &amp;amp;amp; Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha last year. A majority of these imports were from China.  The value of solar cells/photovoltaic cells whether or not assembled in module/panel, imported from China jumped to $3.41 billion in 2017-18 from $596.73 million in 2013-14, the minister informed.  In 2018-19, China supplied&nbsp;over 80 percent of the antibiotics imported by India and well above 60 percent of electronic products and components. Thus, some of the key sectors of the Indian economy are critically dependent on China.  Even though the percentage of imports from India to China remains low, it would impact China in the long run.&nbsp;In&nbsp;2017, India became the 24th largest exporter to China. If India chooses to boycott, it would impact China's entry into a large market such as India, but the intensity of impact would be felt more at home.  &amp;quot;If India decides to boycott Chinese products, it will not make any economic sense given the kind of dependency that we have,&amp;quot; Dhar said.  Latest trade data, however, shows that India's bilateral trade deficit with China has shrunk this year, according to a report by The Hindu BusinessLine. In the first nine months of 2018-19, India's exports to China have grown by an impressive 34 percent (as against less than 10 percent overall), while imports from its northern neighbour have declined by nearly 4.5 percent (as against an increase of 14 percent overall).  The decline was mostly due to the increased exports of petroleum products to&nbsp;China.&nbsp;Reliance Industries' aromatic production capacities over the past couple of years&nbsp;have found its way into the export market with China emerging as one of the major destinations, according to the report.  Even though it may indicate a reversal in the rising trend in the trade deficit,&nbsp;there remains a significant area of concern - the absence of&nbsp;adequate manufacturing facilities.  A number of these sectors would be affected if India decides to boycott Chinese products. To be able to boycott Chinese goods, India&nbsp;needs to reduce its trade deficit with China and strengthen its manufacturing sector to be able to produce goods back home, providing cheaper products to customers.

PDVSA was importing about 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of naphtha, mostly from the United States, to dilute up to 400,000 bpd of extra heavy oil and make it exportable.  Reliance's Houston-based subsidiary was supplying diluents to Venezuela.

In its final tariff order, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) in a March 12 order said transporting natural gas on the East-West pipeline would cost Rs 71.66 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) on gross calorific value (GCV) basis from April 1 as compared to Rs 52.33 per mmBtu tariff charged for April 1, 2009, to March 31, 2019, period.  The tariff approved is almost half of the tariff sought by East West Pipeline Ltd - the operator of the pipeline. It had sought the tariff to be raised to Rs 151.84 per mmBtu with effect from April 1, 2018.  A rise in tariff would lead to increase in the price of fertiliser as well as city gas like CNG that uses gas brought through the pipeline starting from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh and running up to Bharuch in Gujarat.  The pipeline primarily transports KG-D6 gas, which has steadily dipped from 69.43 million standard cubic meters per day achieved in March 2010 to under 3 mmscmd.  PNGRB in a 49-page order went into cost calculations and other parameters to fix the tariff.  &amp;quot;The tariff has been worked out based on information provided by the entity and deliberations. However, PNGRB intends to verify/audit the information provided for tariff determination and method of cost allocation, etc. by an internal team of PNGRB or by an external agency,&amp;quot; the order said.  The tariff, it said, will be subject to revision based on the audit of information and data.  Originally, EWPL had proposed a levelised tariff of Rs 55.91 per mmBtu for transporting the gas beginning April 1, 2009 but PNGRB fixed a provisional tariff of Rs 52.53 per mmBtu.  The company in October 2017 proposed a final tariff for the pipeline at Rs 78.72 effective from April 1, 2009, till the end of the economic life of the pipeline - up to March 31, 2034.  When PNGRB sought clarifications, EWPL updated the tariff filing to state that Rs 52.23 per mmBtu would be the tariff till 2017 and Rs 151.84 would be charged from 2018-19 to 2035-36.  The PNGRB order said the pipeline operator has claimed a total capex of Rs 18,307.37 crore under two heads - actual capex of Rs 16,347.96 crore and future capex of Rs 1,959.41 crore.  PNGRB said when it first fixed the provisional tariff, it had assessed the pipeline's carrying capacity of 85 million standard cubic metres per day including 21.25 mmscmd for use on a common carrier, open access and non-discriminatory basis by any third party.  But the company challenged this first before the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity (APTEL) and then before the Delhi High Court. The Court had in April last year ordered fixing of the tariff once the quorum of PNGRB was complete.  PNGRB became fully functional a year back when the government made appointments of Chairman and members of the Board.  PNGRB sought views of stakeholders on EWPL's tariff filing and gave a detailed order after considering all views.

Jio continues to add subscribers on the back of aggressive pricing while others struggle to add and maintain their market share.  What does the latest TRAI data suggests? TRAI&nbsp;recently published subscriber data for December 2018. Overall, the industry continues to grow and witnessed an addition of 4.5 million new customers, taking&nbsp;its total subscriber base to 1.176 billion.  Jio &ndash; reducing the gap with leaders Jio continues to maintain its momentum and added 8.6 million subscribers in December, the highest number of subscribers added in the month among all. Jio currently has an active subscriber base of 280 million. On the back of its competitive pricing strategy, it continues to gain market share and is reducing the gap with incumbents. Its market share reached 23.8 percent in December, up from 23.2 percent last month.  Bharti Airtel &ndash; lost again! Bharti Airtel reversed the trend of last two months and lost 1.5 million subscribers, taking its subscriber base to 340 million as at December-end. Further, it&nbsp;saw a 23 basis points (100 bps=1 percentage point) loss in market share&nbsp;month-on-month at 28.9 percent.  Vodafone&ndash;Idea:&nbsp;Struggle&nbsp;continues The company that is struggling the most is Vodafone-Idea, which has been continuously losing market share. It has seen its subscriber base fall by&nbsp;29 million&nbsp;over the last eight months and&nbsp;market share shrink by 656 bps. The company lost 2.3 million customers in December 2018, taking its subscriber base to 419 million at the end of the month.    What to expect going forward? We see no signs of rising average revenue per user (ARPUs) as Jio continues to aggressively add customers on the back of its Jio Phone and post-paid customers. As Jio has not been slashing tariffs further, we expect stability in ARPUs going forward. But the competition is not expected to ebb in the near term and hence we advise investors to tread cautiously in the sector.

In the last two sessions, Nifty has formed a double bottom at 10,912 odd levels.  Nifty has formed a bullish rounding bottom on the intraday hourly charts. The primary trend of the Nifty is still positive with the index currently trading above its 5, 20 and 200-days simple moving average (SMA).  Last Friday, when the government presented its Interim Budget, Nifty made an intraday top at 10,983. This was the third time when Nifty took resistance around 10,980-10,988 range.  On Dec 19, 2018, Nifty made a top at 10,985 and on Jan 21, 2019, Nifty made a top at 10,987. There is a triple top formation on the Nifty daily charts and any level above 10,988 resistances would be considered as a breakout from the consolidation pattern.  However, the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap 100 indices continued their underperformance by falling 0.9 percent and 1.55 percent, respectively. On YTD basis also, both the indices are down 6 percent each as against 0.50 percent gain in the Nifty.  On the Derivatives front as well, we have seen long positions being built in Nifty and Bank Nifty Futures&rsquo; during the first two days of the February series.  Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) created fresh longs in both &mdash; Index and Stock Futures&rsquo; segment on Friday. Amongst the Options, Put writing was seen around 10700-10800 levels.  Moreover, 10700 is the level which consists of highest Open Interest (OI) amongst the Nifty February Put options. Considering the technical and derivative evidence discussed above, we believe that the short-term trend in the Nifty is still bullish and one should remain optimistic about the market for the coming days.  Therefore, our advice would be to go long in Nifty with a stop loss of 10,700 levels and a target of 11,200 and 11,350 levels.  Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 7-10% return in the next 1 month:  RIL: Buy| LTP: Rs 1290| Target: Rs. 1385| Stop-Loss Rs 1230| Return 7%  Reliance Industries has given a breakout on the daily chart on Monday by closing above the resistance level of Rs 1265. The primary trend of the Reliance is bullish as the stock price is trading above its 200-day SMA since January 2017.  The momentum indicators and Oscillators like RSI and MACD are showing strength on the daily charts. RIL is trading just 3 percent off from the all-time high of 1329 which it touched in August last year and the technical indicators are pointing that the stock is likely to cross that high in the days to come.  Therefore, we recommend investors to buy Reliance Industries at the current market price of Rs 1290 and average at 1260 for the target of 1385. Investors can keep a stop loss below Rs 1230.  Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 1272| Target: Rs 1370| Stop-Loss: Rs 1220| Return 8%  The primary trend of the Kotak Mahindra Bank is bullish with higher tops and higher bottom formation on the daily chart.

India's No.1 oil refining and petrochemical company plans to roll out its online shopping platform that will combine its retail arm's nearly 10,000 stores in over 6,500 towns as well as neighbourhood retailers with its fast expanding mobile phone network that already has 28 crore subscribers.  &amp;quot;Our analysis suggests RIL can become a market leader in telecom and media, while gaining significant share in retail/e-commerce.  &amp;quot;Its success could be built on an ecosystem or bundling strategy, and a home-court advantage, similar to Alibaba's success in China, beyond explicit or implicit policy support,&amp;quot; brokerage firm UBS said.  While Amazon's strong 'Prime' membership growth has been a key pillar of its business, Reliance has similarly built a strong telecom subscriber base.  The company has already surprised investors by reaching a market-leading position in telecom within a short span of two-and-a-half years. Its edge in fixed broadband (FTTH) derives from low penetration, high capital intensity, a fibre roll-out lead, and content tie-ups.  &amp;quot;In retail/e-commerce, despite competition from well-funded global companies, RIL's wide footprint of physical stores along with its omnichannel focus, subscriber reach and regulations governing foreign e-commerce entities could help it gain a 300 basis point market share in high-growth, modern retail,&amp;quot; it said.  The company's traditional energy businesses have funded the consumer segment and remain key to its market-leading position.  RIL, it said, can potentially become a unique quadruple play by bundling connectivity, carriage, content and commerce to gain higher share of consumers' wallet.  Listing some comparables between Alibaba and Reliance, it said pursuing an ecosystem or a bundling strategy in a high-growth fragmented retail sector with lower online penetration and home-turf advantage are common to both.  Amazon's core value proposition to customers is its 'Prime' subscription, which offers free shipping and video and music content. &amp;quot;Our assessment of the capital framework, regulations, business positioning and emerging trends in each of its consumer-facing business indicates RIL can lead in telecom and media and gain significant share in retail/e-commerce,&amp;quot; it said.  &amp;quot;Can RIL evolve into India's Amazon/Alibaba/Walmart?,&amp;quot; UBS asked and answered it with a &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;  Currently, the company's energy business contributes 75 per cent of its EBITDA. Consumer business accounts for the remaining 25 per cent.  &amp;quot;We think there are many similarities between the India of today and the China of 10 years ago. India's retail landscape is fragmented, and there are significant demographic and socioeconomic differences from top to low-tier cities.  &amp;quot;Online penetration is low in India, with e-commerce accounting for 2.3 per cent of retail sales in 2018; in comparison, China's e-commerce penetration is over 20 per cent currently. This means India is still not at the sweet spot for e-commerce adoption, where mainstream adopters shift rapidly to online spending and platforms experience hyper-growth,&amp;quot; UBS said.  Reliance also has a 'home court' advantage.  &amp;quot;There are now more supportive policies in India. India's e-commerce law should be supportive of domestic companies, including RIL. In China, Alibaba was also able to overtake a dominant eBay in the early days because it invested more both to sign up merchants and to acquire customers.  &amp;quot;Beyond any explicit or implicit policy support, we believe this home court advantage is important. Companies that have to justify years of heavy investments in a foreign market often at times will be less aggressive than a domestic one that has nowhere to go if it fails to gain traction,&amp;quot; it added.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

The year-on-year growth in profit was 8.8 percent and revenue growth was 56.7 percent.  &amp;quot;Increase in revenue is primarily on account of higher price realisations and volumes for petrochemical and refining businesses along with continuing strong growth momentum in consumer businesses,&amp;quot; RIL said.

Jio&rsquo;s freebies intensified the price war leading to consolidation in the industry and elimination of marginal players. Big players faced the heat due to a steady decline in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and found it difficult to maintain their market share as Jio&rsquo;s competitive pricing helped it dd new customers. This trend continues and was visible in the latest subscriber addition numbers reported by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).  What does the latest TRAI data suggest? Recently,&nbsp;the telecom published&nbsp;subscriber data for October 2018. The industry continues to grow and witnessed an addition of 8.5 million new customers, taking the total subscriber base to 1.02 billion.  Jio reducing the gap with leaders Jio continues to maintain its momentum and added 8.5 million subscribers in October 2018, the highest monthly subscriber additions in&nbsp;a month. Significant addition was driven by JioPhone2 flash sale. Jio currently has an active subscriber base of 216 million. On the back of its competitive pricing strategy, it continues to gain market share and reduced the gap with incumbents. Its market share touched 21.1 percent in October 2018, up from 20.5 percent in the preceding month.  Bharti Airtel&nbsp;bucks last three-month's trend Bharti Airtel, the leader in term of active subscriber base before the Vodafone-Idea merger, saw net monthly additions after three consecutive months of disappointment. It added 3.4 million subscribers, taking the subscriber base to 340 million. It maintained its market share at 33.3 percent.  Vodafone&ndash;Idea &ndash; struggle is on The company struggling the most is Vodafone-Idea, which has been continuously losing market share. It saw its subscriber base and market share fall 20.1 million and 303.6 bps&nbsp;over the last six months, respectively. The company lost 2.9 million customers in October 2018, with its total subscriber base at 400 million at the end of the month.    What to expect going forward? We see no signs of rising ARPUs yet as Jio continues to aggressively add customers on the back of its JioPhone and postpaid customers. Although Jio has not been slashing tariffs any further now, we expect stability in ARPUs going forward.

The stock gained 1.7 percent in the early trade on January&nbsp;7.  The research expects the&nbsp;start of full-fledged e-commerce as well as an omnichannel retail platform.  Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of the oil-retail-to-telecom major had said in Q2FY19 earnings release that company's commitment to create consumer value was gathering momentum, with the robust scale-up of India centric consumer-facing businesses.  &amp;quot;The financial performance of both Retail and Jio reflect the benefits of scale, technology and operational efficiencies. Retail business EBITDA has grown three-fold YoY whereas Reliance Jio EBITDA has grown nearly 2.5 times. Jio has now crossed 250 million subscriber milestone and continues to be the largest mobile data carrier in the world,&amp;quot; he explained.  He, in company's 41st annual general meeting speech in July, had said New Commerce platform had the potential to redefine retailing in India and become one of the biggest new growth engines for Reliance in the years to come.  &amp;quot;We are also looking at nation-wide platforms in Agriculture, Education and Healthcare. I am confident that growth in these consumer businesses, based on asset-light platforms of the future, will be nonlinear and exponential,&amp;quot; he added.  Concerns on capex&nbsp;and debt should be allayed by mid-2019, CLSA said, adding big gross refining margin boost from International Maritime Organization and strong subscriber addition are core triggers.  By the end of 2019, Jio could get to 40 crore subscribers, the research house said.  At 1028 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 1,117.00, up Rs 17.95, or 1.63 percent on the BSE.
