The financial sector reclaimed its position as the No. 1 wealth creator while public sector undertakings recorded their worst performance in 2016-21, the Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study showed. The financial sector was both the top wealth creating and top wealth destroying sector.  Equity was the biggest wealth creating asset class of the year as stock markets the world over created history by reaching record highs. The market-capitalisation of most companies and benchmark indices skyrocketed, first-time investors got attracted to the stock markets, and unprecedented liquidity was available in the market.  Adani Transmission emerged as the fastest wealth creator and Adani Enterprises the best all-round wealth creator.  Motilal Oswal found that the Top 100 companies in India&rsquo;s equity markets created Rs 71 lakh crore in wealth during the five years from 2016 to 2021. This was the highest wealth created in the past 26 five-year periods. The pace of wealth creation was also robust at a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent vis-&agrave;-vis 14 percent for the BSE Sensex.  The previous best period in terms of wealth creation was 2014-19, when the markets generated Rs 49 lakh crore of wealth for investors. The five-year period of 2015-20 was impacted by the pandemic and created Rs 21 lakh crore of investor wealth.  The Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2021, was released on December 15. The firm&rsquo;s wealth creation study was commissioned by Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Group.  Reliance rules the roost  Reliance Industries, the largest Indian company by market capitalisation, smashed all records to emerge as the largest wealth creator for the third time in a row. It added Rs 9.7 lakh crore to investor wealth, beating its own previous record of Rs 5.6 lakh crore during 2014-19. The company accounted for 13.6 percent of the total wealth created during the period.  &ldquo;Reliance&rsquo;s re-emergence as the biggest wealth creator reflects the power of phygital &ndash; physical plus digital,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in the report. &ldquo;Its oil-to-chemicals and retail businesses are strongly rooted in the physical whereas the telecom business is the digital dimension. Going forward, expect more and more phygital and digital companies to spearhead wealth creation.&rdquo;  IT giant&nbsp;Tata Consulting Services&nbsp;came in second by creating wealth of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, followed by&nbsp;HDFC Bank,&nbsp;which added Rs 5.2 lakh crore,&nbsp;Hindustan Unilever&nbsp;Rs 3.4 lakh crore and Infosys Rs 3.3 lakh crore.  Bajaj Finance,&nbsp;ICICI Bank,&nbsp;HDFC,&nbsp;Kotak Mahindra Bank&nbsp;and&nbsp;HCL Technologies&nbsp;made up the remaining top 10 wealth creators for 2016-21.  Reliance also made its entry into the list of top 10 fastest wealth creators, an area which is ruled predominantly by mid and small cap companies.  Adani Group &ndash; fastest in the race  The study found Adani Transmission&nbsp;was the fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 93 percent during 2016-21. Another Adani Group company &ndash;&nbsp;Adani Enterprises&nbsp;&ndash; was ranked the third fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 86 percent, behind&nbsp;Deepak Nitrite,&nbsp;which had a price CAGR of 90 percent.  Tanla Platforms&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ruchi Soya&nbsp;were the other two companies in the top five fastest wealth creators.  A sum of Rs 10 lakh invested equally in 2016 among the top 10 fastest wealth creators would have grown to Rs 170 lakh in 2021, which is a CAGR of 77 percent compared with 14 percent for the Sensex, according to the study.  &ldquo;For high wealth creation, it is essential to pick small-to-mid companies with robust earnings growth prospects trading at reasonable valuations,&rdquo; the study highlighted.  Adani Enterprises also emerged as the most consistent wealth creator in the past five years with the highest price CAGR of 86 percent.  Sectoral Participation  The financial sector emerged as the biggest wealth creating sector during 2016-21 by generating Rs 17.4 lakh crore. The sector lost its numero uno position last year to consumer &amp;amp;amp; retail, which came in at third position this year with Rs 12.5 lakh crore. Technology occupied the second position by adding Rs 15.2 lakh crore.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and metals &amp;amp;amp; mining made up the remaining list of top five biggest wealth creating sectors.  Led by rapid adoption of cloud, transformation and digitisation, the technology sector is witnessing robust demand and a strong deal pipeline, which will lead to high growth for the sector.  &ldquo;It is the only sector which may potentially challenge the dominance of the financial sector in the next wealth creation study period, 2017-2022,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said.  PSUs lose the plot  Public sector undertakings (PSUs) came up with their worst performance in the wealth creation process in 2016-21. Only Gujarat Gas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Indraprastha Gas could make it to the top 100 wealth creators, generating less than 1 percent of the total wealth.  The previous period of 2015-20, there were seven PSUs in the top 100, with 3 percent of the total wealth created. The study also found out that there were five PSUs in the top 10 wealth destroying companies. Private banks were the top wealth creators while public sector banks made up the top wealth destroyers.  Digital &ndash; the way to go  The wealth creation report highlighted that digital will be the mantra of the future.  &ldquo;Globally, value is migrating from atoms (businesses dealing in physical matter) to bits (businesses that are digital in nature),&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;This has already played out in a big way in the US.&rdquo;  The digital ecosystem in India is right for atoms-to-bits to play out here, it said.  According to the report, bits deal in intangible assets, have very low cost of replicating their products, and benefit from network effects.  &ldquo;As a result, bits can scale up very rapidly compared to their atom counterparts,&rdquo; the report added.  Bits have high initial losses and their success depends on hyper growth, operational scalability, large opportunity size, favourable unit economics, wide distribution and network effects.

The retail business saw strong recovery and performed well.,,"Reliance Industries, Result Analysis",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/result-analysis/reliance-q2-results-satisfy-as-retail-shines_15661061.html,"Reliance Industries' (RIL) September quarter results (Q2FY22) are broadly in line with analysts' estimates, and have even outperformed on some parameters. The company&rsquo;s consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased by 11 percent vis-&agrave;-vis the June quarter (Q1FY22) to Rs 26,020 crore. This represents a 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) EBITDA growth.  Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a report on October 22, &ldquo;RIL's Q2 EBITDA was in line with Jefferies estimates (JEFe) on beat in Retail, in line O2C and miss in Jio.&rdquo; O2C refers to RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemical segments.  The broker further added, &ldquo;EBITDA was up 11 percent quarter-on-quarter with Jio 1&nbsp;percent below JEFe, Reliance Retail (RR) 6&nbsp;percent ahead of JEFe and O2C in line with JEFe.&rdquo;  With the restrictions easing after the second covid-19 wave, the retail business saw a strong recovery. RIL&rsquo;s Q2 retail revenues have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Core retail revenue growth stood at 16 percent YoY. The business saw a meaningful improvement in store operating hours to 89 percent in September versus 38 percent in June.  Footfalls have recovered to 78 percent of pre-pandemic levels compared to 46 percent in Q1. The company saw strong growth in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle with record quarterly sales in apparel &amp;amp;amp; footwear category. New stores added in Q2 stood at 813, which is far higher than 123 stores added in Q1.  On the other hand, Reliance Jio&rsquo;s performance was a tad underwhelming. The firm saw a churn of low-end subscribers owing to the pandemic&rsquo;s impact, driving a net decline of 11.1 million in customer base in Q2. &ldquo;A repeat of Jio's Q2 subscriber performance in Q3 will definitely dampen hopes of a tariff hike over the next few quarters.  For now, we will closely watch the JioPhone Next launch and its impact on Jio's net subscriber additions,&rdquo; said Jefferies&rsquo; analysts in another report. To an extent, better ARPU (average revenue per user) compensated for the subscriber performance. In Q2, ARPU stood at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, representing a 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Centrum Broking Ltd analysts said in their first cut note, &ldquo;Retail and Telecom now forms approx. 48 percent of consolidated EBITDA versus around 32/40 percent in FY20/21. With the continued reopening across the country from June driving a strong return to normalcy H2FY22 will see much stronger numbers from both these segments, in our opinion.&rdquo;  Meanwhile, RIL&rsquo;s O2C business performance was decent last quarter. Revenues grew 58 percent YoY mainly on account of better realizations driven by the increase in oil prices and higher volumes. O2C EBITDA increased by around 44 percent year-on-year and 4 percent sequentially.  Overall, RIL&rsquo;s profit after tax (PAT) in Q2 increased by 46 percent YoY and 12 percent quarter-on-quarter. Centrum Broking&rsquo;s analysts said, &ldquo;RIL adjusted consolidated EBITDA/ PAT at Rs 26000 crore/ Rs 15500 crore, beat Centrum&rsquo;s estimated EBITDA/ PAT of Rs24800 crore/ 14600 crore as retail revived strongly with higher margins (retail EBIT +66&nbsp;percent quarter-on-quarter).&rdquo;  Ahead of the results announcement on Friday, the RIL stock closed marginally higher at Rs 2,627.40 per share on the National Stock Exchange. Some analysts expect the growth outlook to be strong. JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd expects a strong free cash flow generation phase with major capex completed and strong 17-18&nbsp;percent earnings per share CAGR likely over the next three-five years. CAGR is the compound annual growth rate.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

All businesses&nbsp;recorded growth over pre-Covid levels with the digital services segment having a record quarterly business in Q2.  Profit in the year-ago period was at Rs 10,602 crore and Rs 13,806 crore in June 2021 quarter. The sequential growth in profit was 12.1 percent.  Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs&nbsp;1.74 lakh crore, significantly higher by 49.8 percent compared to Rs 1.16&nbsp;lakh crore reported in the year-ago period, said Reliance Industries in its BSE filing, adding the topline growth on a sequential basis was 20.6 percent.  &amp;quot;Reliance has posted a strong performance in Q2FY22. This demonstrates the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies. All businesses reflect growth over pre-Covid levels,&amp;quot; said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani in a statement.  He further said the operational and financial performance reflected a sharp recovery in the retail segment and sustained growth in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and digital services business.  &amp;quot;O2C business benefited from sharp recovery in demand across products and higher transportation fuel margins. Reliance Retail continues to grow on the back of rapid expansion of both physical stores and digital offerings resulting in healthy growth in revenues and margin expansion,&amp;quot; Ambani added.  He said Jio, the digital services business, continued to transform the broadband market in India and set new benchmarks for the industry.  The standalone profit of the company grew by 44.1 percent to Rs 9,228 crore and gross revenue increased by 68.8 percent to Rs 1.08 lakh crore YoY in Q2.  The operating performance was also strong during the quarter, with record consolidated EBITDA at Rs 30,283 crore for the quarter, growing 30 percent YoY.  Jio Platforms  The telecom business reported quarterly operating revenue at Rs 19,777 crore, a growth of 15.1 percent YoY (adjusted for interconnection usage charge&nbsp;or IUC), driven by continued subscriber traction in the connectivity business, with&nbsp;average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, which is a healthy 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Jio, which continued to hold the top position in 4G coverage and availability, had a customer base of 429.5 million at the end of September 2021, a net addition of 23.8 million customers YoY.  Its net profit grew by&nbsp;a massive 23.5&nbsp;percent YoY to Rs 3,728 crore and EBITDA increased by 16.6 percent to Rs 9,294 crore in the quarter ended September 2021.  Retail Business  Reliance Retail&nbsp;delivered strong performance with revenue from operations growing 9.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 39,926 crore in September 2021 quarter which saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer&nbsp;sentiments amid festivities, relaxations in Covid related curbs and vaccinations.  &amp;quot;The business re-established growth momentum in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle with sales closing above pre-Covid levels. Consumer electronics and grocery maintained strong growth momentum,&amp;quot; the company said.  Retail business profit for the quarter at Rs 1,695 crore grew by 74.2 percent, with&nbsp;EBIDTA growth of 45.2 percent YoY at Rs 2,913 crore, driven by favourable revenue mix, and continued focus on cost management and investment income, said the company, adding&nbsp;EBITDA margin expanded by 180 bps&nbsp;YoY driven by strong operating leverage.  Oil-To-Chemicals Business  The O2C business sustained growth momentum, registering a&nbsp;58.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.2 lakh crore&nbsp;primarily due to improved realisation on the back of increase in oil prices and higher volumes.&nbsp;Refinery throughput increased by 11.8 percent YoY to 17.1 MMT (million metric tonnes)&nbsp;during the quarter.  Crude prices were lifted higher by tighter supply amid multiple production outages, lowering in uptick&nbsp;of Covid infections and higher overall throughput.&nbsp;Brent crude averaged $73.5&nbsp;a barrel in Q2FY22, up by $4.6&nbsp;QoQ and&nbsp;$30.5 YoY).  Reliance said O2C business EBITDA improved by 43.9 percent YoY to&nbsp;Rs&nbsp;12,720 crore primarily on account of better transportation fuel cracks, higher intermediates product deltas, efficient product placement and yield management. However, &amp;quot;EBITDA margin for the quarter declined by 100bps YoY to 10.6 percent due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&amp;quot; it noted.  Solar Energy Business  Reliance Industries has increased its focus on solar energy segment as it is going to establish and enable up to 100 GW of solar energy in India by 2030, and become a global player in the renewable industry.  &amp;quot;We continue to make steady progress in accelerating foray into new energy and new materials business. Our partnership approach and the desire to bring India to the forefront of global transition to clean and green transition is underscored by recent investments in some of the best companies in the world in the solar and green energy space,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  &amp;quot;I am now even more confident of achieving ambitious target of Net Carbon Zero by 2035,&amp;quot; he added.  Recently its subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL) acquired 86,887 series C preferred shares of Germany's NexWafe GmbH at a price of EUR 287.73 per share for 25 million euros. NexWafe is developing and producing monocrystalline silicon wafers.  Reliance New Energy Solar also decided to acquire 40 percent stake in Sterling &amp;amp;amp; Wilson Solar, which executed 11-plus GW of solar turnkey projects globally, through a combination of primary investment, secondary purchase and open offer. Moreover, it acquired REC Solar Holdings AS, one of the world's leading solar cells / panels and polysilicon manufacturing company, from China National Bluestar (Group) Co Ltd, for an enterprise value of $771 million.  In the retail segment, its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures though 7-India Convenience Retail entered into a master franchise agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. for launch of 7-Eleven convenience stores in India.  With effect from September 1, Reliance Retail Ventures had taken sole control of Just Dial,&nbsp;India's&nbsp;leading local search engine platform which provides search-related services to users across India.

The Reliance stock price hit a record high of Rs 2,750 on the BSE on October 19, with a market capitalisation of almost Rs 18.3 lakh crore. The stock had a strong run-up recently after the company signed several deals in the solar energy business. It has gained 24 percent since the beginning of July.  The September quarter earnings, to be declared on October 22, will likely decide the direction of the stock price.  Experts said Reliance&rsquo;s retail and digital businesses, which accounted for 32.4 percent and 18.5 percent of total revenue, respectively, could be the stars in the September quarter, driving double-digit growth in every earnings parameter.  &ldquo;Retail and digital business will post a strong recovery,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in its earnings preview. The brokerage, which has a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; call on the stock, expects consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 24 percent YoY, driven by the retail and digital businesses, and revenue growth of 34 percent YoY.  Motilal Oswal expects the oil-to-chemical segment&rsquo;s EBITDA to grow by 39 percent, Reliance Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA to increase by 21 percent, and retail EBITDA to grow by 38 percent from a year earlier.  Yes Securities expects&nbsp;Reliance to report better earnings (QoQ and YoY) on improved retail profitability and refinery margins.  The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) was at $3.7 a barrel, the highest in the past seven quarters, improving further QoQ in Q2 of FY22, led by better gasoline, aviation turbine fuel and naphtha cracks amid hurricane-led supply disruptions, said Motilal Oswal. GRM is a measure of&nbsp;the amount that refiners earn from turning each barrel of crude oil into fuel products.  Brent crude prices averaged $73 a barrel in Q2, a jump of about 70 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ, due to supply-side disruptions and inventory shortages. This despite OPEC+ easing production cuts starting in August. Recent hurricanes in the US have taken out more than 25 million barrels of offshore production, said Motilal Oswal.  Brent prices have been increasing and crossed $86 a barrel on October 21 for the first time since October 2018. The rally in prices is largely because of expectations of strong global growth, power outages mainly in China, and supply concerns.  Kotak, too, expects strong earnings growth at Reliance for the quarter, with consolidated profit rising 38.3 percent, EBITDA up 35.1 percent and revenue increasing 32.1 percent YoY.

Disclosing the results of shareholder votes on the appointment, Reliance in a regulatory filing said 98.03 per cent of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to appoint Al-Rumayyan for three years.  As many as 10.89 crore shares or 1.96 per cent voted against the resolution, while 3.23 crore votes were declared invalid due to lack of proper authorisation, it said.  The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), a shareholder of Reliance, had last month decided to vote against the move based on US proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation.  CalSTRS decided to oppose the appointment due to Al-Rumayyan's position in Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its governor, as well as in Aramco.  PIF has already invested Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail and Rs 11,367 crore in RIL's Jio Platforms. Also, Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in Reliance's oil-to-chemical business.  Reliance had, however, rejected conflict of interest allegations saying, &amp;quot;The appointment of Yasir Al Rumayyan has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco&amp;quot;.  The O2C business of RIL is being spun off to a subsidiary.  &amp;quot;As per the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,&amp;quot; it added.  As of June 30, 2020, CalSTRS held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of RIL, according to its website. CalSTRS is America's second-largest public pension fund with assets totalling approximately USD 318.4 billion as of August 31, 2021.  CalSTRS's opposition was based on a report by Glass, Lewis &amp;amp;amp; Co, an American proxy advisory services company. According to Glass, Lewis &amp;amp;amp; Co, since Al-Rumayyan has a key role in the operations of Aramco and PIF, he does not qualify to be an independent director.  Under Indian law, an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the firm that intends to appoint him or her.

Of these, more than 50 have already begun including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, an initiative of Geneva-based WEF, in their mainstream financial and regulatory reporting. These include PayPal, PwC, Petronas, S&amp;amp;amp;P, Salesforce, Total and Yara International.  The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The project's twin objectives are to accelerate convergence among the leading private ESG standard-setters and to bring greater comparability and consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures.  During its ongoing Sustainable Development Impact Summit, the WEF said that the international support is growing for the stakeholding capitalism metrics initiative with more than 50 companies having begun reporting these metrics in their 2020-2021 filings, while over 100 have shown support for this initiative so far.  The summit brings together global leaders from business, government, and civil society under the theme 'Shaping an Equitable, Inclusive and Sustainable Recovery'.  Those having committed to such reporting include Accenture, Allianz, Bank of America, Dell, Deloitte, EY, HEINEKEN, IBM, Mahindra Group, Mastercard, Nasdaq, Nestle, Reliance Industries, UBS, Unilever and Wipro.  Drawn from existing standards, the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics provide a set of metrics that can be reported on by all companies, regardless of industry or region, the WEF said.  The metrics also offer comparability, which is particularly important for informing ongoing efforts to create a systemic, globally accepted set of common standards for reporting on sustainability performance.  &amp;quot;We are delighted to see so many companies joining this effort and, even more so, excited to see many already implementing the metrics into their reporting,&amp;quot; WEF Managing Director Olivier Schwab said.  &amp;quot;This is the first time we have publicly seen this breadth of data from global companies across sectors on ESG factors. The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are already demonstrating that consistent and comparable ESG reporting can help articulate to stakeholders the collective contribution of ESG commitments,&amp;quot; Schwab added.  An early analysis of reports already incorporating the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in mainstream reporting demonstrates that it is now easier to consistently measure individual company progress against critical ESG areas, as well as the collective impact of those companies committed to reporting the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.  An initial analysis of the first 45 reports from companies shows how companies are building skills for the future, with over USD 1.5 trillion invested in training.  They also indicate that companies are innovating for better products and services, with over USD 20 trillion spent on R&amp;amp;amp;D and USD 23 trillion in cumulative multi-year innovation investments.

International Climate Summit 2021: Here is the full text  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,  Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri. Bhupender Yadav ji,&nbsp; Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Power and New &amp;amp;amp; Renewable Energy Shri Raj Kumar Singh ji, Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Science and Technology Shri Jitendra Singh ji,&nbsp; Member Energy NITI Aayog Dr. V K Saraswat,&nbsp; Former Executive Director International Energy Agency, Mr. Nobuo Tanaka Chairman Greenstat India, Mr. Sturle Pedersen Other distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning to all of you.  It is my privilege to deliver the inaugural address at the International Climate Summit - 2021 before this august audience.  I am delighted to see that this conference is bringing together leading policymakers, industrialists, investors, and scientists to discuss climate change and clean energy.  This Summit is taking place against the backdrop of a historic announcement by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on August 15.  In his address to the nation on the 75th Independence Day, he launched the Green Hydrogen Mission for India.  The fact that he chose &ldquo;Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav&rdquo; to make this announcement has sent a powerful message to both Indians and the rest of the world.  In my view, the message is two-fold:  One, India is determined to achieve azadi from dependence on fossil energy and become atma-nirbhar in New and Renewal Energy.  Two, India will make its fullest contribution to the global effort for achieving the goals and targets of Climate Action.  Dear Friends,  Climate Change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today. The world is witnessing with alarming frequency the disastrous effects of global warming. Glaciers are retreating. Mean sea level is rising.  Extreme and unpredictable weather changes are becoming regular. Ecological damage is becoming stark. Indeed, Climate Change, if uncontrolled, can threaten the very existence of life on our planet. Therefore, it is not enough to make our economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  We have only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. Because Climate Change is a global problem, the clean energy transition calls for the widest possible global cooperation in technology development, investments and fair market access.  Ladies and gentlemen,   While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India for another reason. Most of our present energy demand is met by imported fossil fuels costing us 160 billion USD every year.&nbsp; Although India&rsquo;s per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world&rsquo;s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  India&rsquo;s energy needs will increase exponentially as our economic growth accelerates to fulfil the aspirations of 1.38 billion people. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  Both India and the world are thus facing an unprecedented challenge. However, every challenge in human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress.  Dear Friends,  I am convinced that Climate Change is an opportunity for human civilisation to renew itself in the 21st century&hellip; An opportunity to create a healthier, happier, more secure and more resilient future for the human race&hellip;  A future in which there will be greater harmony between Man and Mother Nature. This opportunity for civilizational renewal will be realised by New and Renewable Energy. If Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy will provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation.  As a matter of fact, a New GREEN REVOLUTION has already begun in India. The Old Green Revolution made India self-reliant in food production. The New Green Revolution will help make India self-sufficient in energy production.  It is a matter of great pride for all of us that India has now achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy. India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for Renewable Energy.  The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight. &nbsp;The entire world will applaud India&rsquo;s singular achievement under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister.  Dear Friends,  I take this opportunity to share with you my perspectives on how India can become a global leader in Green Energy Revolution in the years to come. The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources.&nbsp; Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land.  Solar is perfectly suited to decentralised energy production, which in turn can promote decentralised socio-economic development. By investing in smart, two-way grids, micro-grids, efficient storage solutions and smart meters, we can enable individuals, communities and neighbourhoods to become both consumers and producers of energy.  These installations can be located close to demand. They have low maintenance requirements.&nbsp; Importantly, they have little environmental impact and entail zero human displacement problems. The rapid fall in the cost of production has made solar energy highly competitive, attracting large-scale investments.  This shall play a key role in ensuring similar growth trends in &ldquo;Green Hydrogen&rdquo; &ndash; the future replacement of fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen is a zero-carbon energy. It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world&rsquo;s decarbonisation plans. Green hydrogen is key to our ever green, sustainable and prosperous future of everyone on the planet  Hydrogen has high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions. Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years.  New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution. Furthermore, the Government of India is planning to create an enabling Green Hydrogen eco-system in the country. Because of all these developments, Green Hydrogen will surely attract significant investments.  Dear Friends,  Reliance Industries is fully committed to realising the vision of our Hon&rsquo;ble Prime Minister to fuel India&rsquo;s Green Economy using clean energy. Last year I had announced our ambitious commitment to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the New Energy Business, which will be the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. This complex will have four Giga Factories, which cover the entire spectrum of renewable energy. The first will be an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. The second will be an advanced energy storage battery factory. &nbsp;The third will be an electrolyser factory for the production of Green Hydrogen.  The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. Over the next three years we will invest 75,000 crore rupees in these initiatives.&nbsp; Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to India and Indians.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has set the goal to reach 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030.&nbsp; This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption.  This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India. Efforts are on globally to make Green Hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under USD 2 per kg.&nbsp; Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade.  And India has always set and achieved even more audacious goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under USD 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade &ndash; the 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen.  India has achieved several goals that seemed impossible over the years. I am sure this 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen will also be achieved by our talented young entrepreneurs, researchers and innovators.  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,  You are the architect of a New India. Your vision of New India is propelled by New and Renewable Energy. It will create millions of new and high-value green jobs for our youth. It will give a big boost to green enterprises in India, who can proudly proclaim: &ldquo;Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!&rdquo;.  It will transform India from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Energy solutions. It will also bridge the green energy divide in India and globally. I am certain that, under your dynamic leadership, India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a People&rsquo;s Movement.  On behalf of all my colleagues in the Indian industry, on behalf of Reliance and on my own behalf, I pledge full support and commitment to your vision and mission.  Thank you.  &nbsp;Disclaimer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary."

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate will announce its Q1FY22 results on July 23.  The company&rsquo;s retail and telecom businesses flourished in FY21, despite COVID-led disruptions, thanks to its aggressive growth philosophy, which mitigated the impact of the pandemic on the overall business and provided the much-needed capital raise and deleveraging.

Aimed at taking on the likes of the other video conferencing apps like Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams, JioMeet was launched in 2020. This was during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that has been terrorising the world and most, if not all countries had issued lockdowns and public restrictions to contain the spread of the virus.  At the recently-concluded AGM, the sheer number of virtual attendees at more than 3.8 lakh proves the scalability of the app when it comes to conferencing. A statement released by Reliance reads, &ldquo;It was a proud moment for the team JioMeet to have successfully completed an event of this scale. This reemphasized on the world class engineering which has gone in making JioMeet so scalable and flexible.&rdquo;  The statement further adds, &ldquo;JioMeet is already one of India&rsquo;s most favorite video conferencing app with HD quality Audio and Video and how it has been built for Indian conditions. JioMeet has made huge in-roads into both retail and enterprise segments.&rdquo;  JioMeet has also been undergoing upgrades and has been adding features to better suit a conferencing environment in India. For example, along with a classroom and whiteboard mode, there is support for the Hindi language as well as support coming in the form of Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.

It gives me great pleasure to greet you all at the 44th Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited.  It is the second year in a row that I miss the intimacy and warmth of face-to-face interaction with you, because of the COVID pandemic. However, the virtual format has enabled several lakhs of our shareholders to participate in the AGM from the safety of their homes.  Friends,  We are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. Its scale, severity and geographical spread are unseen in a century. It has filled the hearts of all Indians with enormous pain and grief.  Several of our employees and shareholders have borne the brunt of this pandemic. Within our one large Reliance Family, the suffering of any member becomes suffering of all.  Today, Nita, I, and my colleagues on the Board offer our heartfelt condolences to all those in our Reliance Family who have lost their loved ones to this pandemic.  I now request that all of us observe a minute of silence in memory of the departed souls.  Esteemed shareholders,  The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2021 have already been circulated to you. With your permission, I would like to take them as read.  Our business performance and financial success since the last AGM have exceeded our expectations, despite the pandemic. But I shall come to that later in my address.  What has given me far greater happiness than our business performance is Reliance's humanitarian efforts during these exceedingly difficult times. I feel both proud and humbled to share with you that throughout the COVID crisis, our Reliance Family has risen to the occasion with a sense of purpose and national duty. Our entire organisation has become energised with the spirit of service.  Every single employee has participated &ndash; directly or indirectly &ndash; in the Fight against COVID and become a Goodwill Ambassador of Reliance.  I am sure our efforts of the last one year would have made our Founding Chairman, Shri Dhirubhai Ambani, proud, because, the one common, unifying thread that runs through everything we have ever done at Reliance is the spirit of CARE and EMPATHY.  WE CARE for our Employees and their Families. WE CARE for our Customers, our Shareholders, and our Partners. WE CARE for the Country and the Community.  WE CARE for the Planet and the People.  This is what the true Reliance spirit was, is, and will always be. I now invite Isha, Akash and Nita to tell us about our COVID Missions of Reliance and the wonderful work done by all our colleagues.  1. Reliance Foundation and COVID Care  ISHA: Good afternoon everyone. I am Isha Ambani. AKASH: And I am Akash Ambani.  ISHA: Last AGM we were hopeful that by this time this year, the pandemic would be behind us. And yet, this is the second time that we are meeting virtually.These have been difficult times. But we have come together as a country, as a society, and as One Reliance family, to rise above them.  AKASH: Despite the challenges we have faced, when we look back at the year &ndash; we feel humbled &amp;amp;amp; inspired that each and every person in our Reliance family went out of their way to help one another, much beyond the call of duty.  ISHA: We know that had our grandfather been with us today, he would be proud. This is the Reliance he always wanted to see. One where each person did their very best to help those in need, and to be of service to our communities and our country.  Many of our Reliance family members have fought this battle from the frontlines - our retail store workers, telecom engineers, doctors, nurses, hospital staff. We have the deepest gratitude and highest admiration for each and every one of them.  AKASH: They ensured, our nation's fuel supplies are intact, digital connectivity is unaffected and daily essential needs of millions of people are met safely. We are indebted to them,for their service to our country, for their service to humanity.  ISHA: I'd like to share a couple of stories, to highlight what some of our colleagues have done in this time: One of our Jio engineers Mr Dave trekked 12 kms at 13,000 ft, in 10 ft of snow, through non-motorable roads, to restore digital connectivity in the Spiti Valley.  AKASH: When the cyclone hit Mumbai earlier this year, some of our Jio &amp;amp;amp; Retail stores faced indefinite power cuts. Our Store Manager Rupesh and so many others kept the stores running on minimum power consumption to ensure uninterrupted supplies to their customers.  ISHA: Many of our front line warriors contracted COVID themselves in the course of their duty but their selfless courage has inspired us every moment of this fight.  For over an year, Ricky Bindra, head of our Corporate Services, had been tirelessly organizing daily meals for the needy, setting up tie-ups for beds, medications, ventilators, oxygen, ambulances, and vaccinations for our entire Reliance Family.  Last month, Ricky and his family were diagnosed COVID positive. Ricky himself was in the ICU for 30 days, completely paralysed for 20 days, on a ventilator for 10 days, but by the grace of God, he is ok and on the road to rehab &amp;amp;amp; recovery now.  Our salute to Ricky, and countless other members of our Reliance family, who have placed their country first, community next, family third, and self last in this hour of need. They are our real-life super-heroes.  AKASH: Thanks to their spirited efforts, millions of our fellow Indians have continued to work from home, shop from home, learn from home, and consult doctors from the safety of their homes, in these tough times.  Our colleagues personify the DNA of Reliance - to CARE, UNITE, INTEGRATE, &amp;amp;amp; EMPOWER.  ISHA: Truly Akash! And to tell us more about Reliance Family's unified and tireless response to this crisis, Let us now welcome the Founder-Chairperson of the Reliance Foundation, our dearest mother, Mrs Nita Ambani!  Thank you, Isha &amp;amp;amp; Akash. Esteemed Shareholders, Namaskar.  I hope that all of you and your loved ones are well and safe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a humanitarian crisis. It has tested the very spirit of humanity. But even in the darkest hour, our spirit has shone bright. We as a people have come together, and fought this battle with immense empathy and compassion.  Reliance Foundation, over the last 11 years, has always stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of India, in every challenge big or small, through good &amp;amp;amp; bad times.  We have tried to make a difference to the lives of 45 million Indians across the country. In the remotest villages and towns of India, we have found and created stories of hope, of change, of transformation. And so last year, when humanity was struck with the worst crisis in over a 100 years,  we did our best to help in whichever way we could, and did so urgently. While our top priority this year was COVID relief, we ensured that we continued all our other developmental work as well.  We remained committed to our vision for Education and Sport for All. Within days of the outbreak, our 14 schools turned into digital schools. They became safe havens of positivity and learning for thousands of students who embraced virtual schooling with unimaginable enthusiasm!  We have also worked very hard through these challenging times, to bring our dream project &ndash; the Jio Institute &ndash; to life! Jio Institute is envisioned to be an exemplary academic institution with a world class platform for research, innovation, and lifelong learning. It will prepare the next generation of global leaders who will significantly contribute to the advancement of India and the world. Despite the pandemic, I am pleased to announce that Jio Institute is all set to commence academic sessions at their campus in Navi Mumbai this year itself!  This year we also launched Reliance Foundation Scholarships in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, for undergraduates and postgraduates.  Beyond education, sport has been another symbol of hope, a medium to delight and inspire the world in these times. In 2020, our champions Mumbai Indians brought in a lot of joy and cheer to millions, by winning their fifth IPL trophy! I wish our team all the best for the upcoming second leg of the IPL 2021.  Our football league ISL became the first, the longest, and the biggest sporting event to be held entirely in India with complete safety protocols, during the pandemic. It took more than 1600 people in 18 different bio-bubbles across 14 different locations in Goa, to pull off Season 7 of the Indian Super League very successfully.  Apart from cricket and football, we continue to focus on other sports like athletics, archery, basketball, badminton, and weightlifting. We have reached out to over 21.5 million children through our grassroots initiatives in various sports all across India. We hope to develop a holistic ecosystem that identifies and trains our young champions of tomorrow!  Speaking of champions, I would like to wish all our athletes of Team India the very best for the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games!  On a personal note, in December last year, Mukesh and I became proud grand-parents to our dearest Akash &amp;amp;amp; Shloka's precious baby boy Prithvi Akash Ambani! Thank you all for your good wishes &amp;amp;amp; blessings on this happy occasion in our family.  Friends,  I am a big believer in the phenomenal power of women. I believe that when women lean on women, incredible things happen. It is my dream and mission to empower every girl in India to write her own destiny.  On Women's Day in March this year, we launched a digital movement for women called Her Circle. Her Circle is an inclusive, collaborative, interactive, and socially-conscious digital platform. A circle of solidarity, sisterhood, and growth.  Reliance Foundation also partnered with USAID to launch the Women Connect India Challenge this year. A partnership that aims to empower more and more Indian women with digital reach and opportunity. Digital technology truly is the backbone of this new world order.  Using the power of digital, we also helped rural communities safeguard their lives and livelihoods from the natural calamities that affected India this year, be it the floods in Assam and Uttarakhand, or the cyclones on our eastern and western coast.  Friends,  Now I would like to take you through the work that Reliance Foundation is doing in our nation's fight against the pandemic. Over the past 15 months, for Mukesh and me, the top priority has been to do whatever we can to help our nation and our people in these difficult times.  Reliance Foundation launched FIVE Missions to fight the virus:  1. Mission Oxygen  2. Mission COVID Infra  3. Mission Anna Seva  4. Mission Employee Care  5. and Mission Vaccine Suraksha Let me start with Mission Oxygen.  As you know, India faced an acute shortage of oxygen as soon as COVID cases began to surge earlier this year. Reliance swung into action on a war footing immediately.  Traditionally, we have never produced medical grade liquid oxygen. Yet when the need arose, we repurposed our Jamnagar refinery within days, to produce high-purity medical grade liquid oxygen and, within two weeks, we ramped up production to a massive 1100 Metric Tonnes per day.  It would normally take over a year to set up a new medical grade oxygen plant of this capacity. But it was a super-human effort by our Reliance engineers, who put in more than 85,000 man-hours of work in less than 10 days to make it possible. They delivered what mattered the most, when it mattered the most!  You will feel proud to know that today Reliance is producing over 11% of India's medical-grade liquid oxygen, the highest by a single company at a single location. We are providing this Pran Vayu &ndash; oxygen &ndash; to one out of every 10 COVID patients in India&hellip; and offering this service to the nation FREE OF COST.  For Mukesh and me, and every member of our Reliance Family, this opportunity to serve humanity is the noblest of all noble causes.  Friends,  In the oxygen supply chain, we have addressed India's serious bottleneck of tankers. Reliance procured 100 new medical-grade oxygen tankers both from within India and other parts of the world, like Germany, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Netherlands, Belgium, Thailand, Indonesia, and put them into service within two weeks.  We also helped in installing Oxygen Generators in several hospitals across the country, to strengthen oxygen availability. I salute all our engineers, doctors, and frontline warriors for working selflessly &amp;amp;amp; tirelessly for Mission Oxygen.  Dear Shareholders,  The key to fighting the pandemic is a strong COVID care infrastructure.  That is what we have tried to achieve through Mission COVID Infra. Last year, within days of the coronavirus outbreak, we set up India's first dedicated 250 bedded COVID facility in Mumbai.  By the time the second wave hit us, we had set up additional 875 beds for COVID care in Mumbai alone. Across India, we created a total capacity of over 2000 beds for COVID care, all equipped to provide uninterrupted oxygen supply and totally free-of-cost treatment.  We also launched a COVID testing lab with a capacity of over 15,000 tests per day.  The entire medical fraternity are the Real Heroes of this fight. They have put their own lives at risk, to save others', day after day. They have stayed isolated and away from their families and loved ones, to care for us.They have worked long hours at a stretch wearing full PPE kits, but never complained.  They have compromised their own health, and gone way beyond their call of duty. Dr. Tarang, Dr. Darshana, Dr Vivek, Sister Aneta, Sister Agnes, Sister Kusum, Brothers Chandrashekhar and Omkar, Managers Akanksha and Kumkum, Shivam, Vikas, Trinette, Mayank, Mayuri,  and countless others&hellip;  They became like friends and families for patients in COVID wards, caring for them, cheering for them, sometimes singing &amp;amp;amp; dancing for them! Their bravery, their selflessness, and their large-heartedness is a tribute to humanity in its purest form.  As a community, we owe each and every front-line warrior a huge debt. With folded hands, I salute their spirit of care and sacrifice. A big thank you on behalf of all of us.  A heartfelt dhanyawad.  Friends,  In the early days of the lockdown, we launched Mission Anna Seva, our commitment to feed the needy, and we extended it to include cattle and stray animals. Today, this commitment has taken the form of the largest meal distribution programme undertaken by a corporate foundation anywhere in the world. We have so far provided more than 7.5 crore free meals to marginalised communities, daily-wage earners, and frontline workers across the country.  Dear Shareholders,  Our next mission &ndash; Mission Employee Care &ndash; is an expression of our care and concern for the most precious members of our extended family, our Reliance Family.  Sanskar aur Mulyoon ke adhar par, humara yeh vishaal reliance parivaar&hellip; humien taaqat deta hai, hausla deta hai, prerna deta hai&hellip; Uski har khushi mein hum saath hain, Aur uske har dukh mein hum hissedar hain...  When the pandemic started last year, literally overnight we migrated to a full-time work-from-home mode. Across Reliance, we made sure that no jobs, no salaries, no bonuses were cut due to COVID. All medical expenses were paid fully, and fully paid leaves were granted. It breaks our hearts that in spite of our best efforts, we lost some precious members of our Reliance Family to the pandemic. Nothing can fill the void they have left in our minds and hearts.  The entire Reliance Family stands in solidarity with their families, and shares their grief. We remain committed to their families' continued well-being and fulfilling the dreams that they saw together. Towards this end, Reliance will continue to:  - pay the deceased employee's salary to the family for the next five years;  - finance their children's education in India till graduation,  - and, ensure continuity of medical coverage to the family for life.  Additionally, a lump-sum amount of TEN lakhs will be provided to families of our off-roll employees who succumbed to COVID-19.  My prayers, thoughts, and deepest condolences are with every family who has lost a loved one. Om Shanti.  Dear friends,  Our fifth and most critical mission is 'Mission Vaccine Suraksha'.  Mass Vaccination is India's topmost and urgent priority now. It is the most reliable way out of this crisis. And to achieve this in the shortest possible time, the Government of India has recently allowed private enterprises and hospitals to join the effort. To help speed up the vaccination drive, we have set up 116 vaccinations centres in 109 cities across the country.  We have made the entire vaccination process very easy &amp;amp;amp; accessible on our physical/digital platform JioHealthHub with a click of a button, you can book a slot or download CoWin Certificates.  Reliance Foundation will offer this platform absolutely free of cost to all users. The platform has the ability to scale up to 1 lakh vaccinations a day, that's one crore vaccinations in 100 days. We are continuously working to further increase this number.  We hope to partner with other corporate and local authorities towards fulfilling the mission of vaccinating all Indians by the end of this year. As we speak, we are already testing this platform with our Reliance family.  We are currently vaccinating all 20 lakh of our Extended Family, including retired employees, partner company employees, and their families &ndash; free of cost. Reliance's Mission Vaccine Suraksha is one of the largest corporate vaccination drives in India.  Executing this Mission on a nationwide basis is a humongous task. But it is our dharma, our duty to every Indian, our promise of safety and protection. Our firm belief that together, we can, and we will overcome.  My dear shareholders,  It is so inspiring to see each and every member of the Reliance Family come together to do their bit and make a difference. And this journey is made even more fulfilling &ndash;  When we get a thank you message from a mother who recovers from COVID, and then reunites with her child, when a senior citizen blesses us for providing essentials at her doorstep, when a migrant family feels they are not alone in the city, when a doctor or nurse on duty can protect themselves as they receive the PPE in time, when a hungry stray dog feels human compassion, when a daughter stuck far away can provide for her old parents through digital solutions and children can continue learning and seeing their friends in virtual school.  These are moments that make you believe that we are in this fight together. And I assure you that in every challenge that India faces, Reliance Foundation has and will continue to stand with every Indian. Together, we shall overcome&hellip;as we always have.  Please take care, stay safe, stay healthy, and stay hopeful. Jai Hind!  Thank you.  Chairman Continues:  Thank you, Nita. Thank you, Isha and Akash.  Let us give a standing ovation to each and every member of Team Reliance for their exemplary commitment, devotion and resolve, for going beyond the call of duty in serving the society in its hour of greatest need. I indeed feel immense pride in leading such a team that combines excellence with empathy.  My Dear Shareholders,  I now turn to the Business and Financial Performance of your company for the Year 2020-21.  2. Business &amp;amp;amp; Financial Performance  I am happy to report that even in a challenging environment, your company's performance continued to be outstanding.  Our consolidated revenue was nearly Rs. 540,000 crore, with a sharp increase from our consumer businesses. Our consolidated EBITDA was nearly Rs. 98,000 crore, and almost 50% of the EBITDA was contributed by consumer businesses.  One of these consumer businesses, Retail, is only about a decade old. The other business, Jio, is only five years old.  Our net profit for the year was Rs. 53,739 crore, higher by 34.8% compared to the previous year. Despite the pandemic, we increased our dividends this year.  Dear Friends,  As India's largest business enterprise, Reliance's contribution to the Indian economy continues to remain unmatched.  At Rs. 1,45,143 crore (US$ 19.9 billion), we continue to be India's largest exporter accounting for 6.8% of India's total merchandise exports across 107 countries.  Even in this challenging environment, Reliance added nearly 75,000 new jobs in the past year. We are committed to creating and enabling large-scale employment opportunities, which is one of India's most urgent national tasks.  We continue to be India's highest payer of customs and excise duty in the private sector with payments of Rs. 21,044 crore. We are amongst the highest payers of GST and VAT at Rs. 85,306 crore.We are amongst the highest payers of Income Tax in the private sector paying Rs. 3,213 crore.  In FY 2021, Reliance successfully carried out the largest ever capital raise by any company globally in a year, notwithstanding the COVID challenges.  The capital raises exceeded Rs. 324,432 crore (USD 44.4 billion) through equity in Jio Platforms and Retail, Rights Issue and asset monetization. The investors included some of the best and marquee names across the world; across sovereign wealth funds, and private equity.  This capital raise is a strong vote of confidence by global investors in India's growth potential. It reflects their faith in the ability of your company's management to execute ambitious projects and long-term value creation plans.  We also rewarded the shareholders with the largest and the most successful Rights Issue ever by an Indian company.I am really delighted that our retail shareholders have made 4x returns in just one year on their rights shares.  All of these helped Reliance achieve a net debt-free balance sheet much ahead of March 2021, a promise I had made two years ago.  Dear friends,  Let me now talk about the performance of the individual businesses.  Jio Platforms is the leading digital company in India with leadership in wireless connectivity and unmatched suite of apps and platforms.  The consolidated revenues in the past year were Rs. 86,493 crore, with EBITDA of Rs. 32,359 crore. We had a net addition of 37.9 million subscribers during the year. We now serve over 425 million consumers on our network. We have revenue market leadership in 19 out of 22 circles.  Reliance Retail continues to be the undisputed leader in organised retailing in the country, with scale that is more than 6 times the next competitor.  Despite a challenging year, Retail had revenues of Rs. 153,818 crore, and EBITDA of Rs. 9,842 crore. We are by far the leader in each category &mdash; grocery, electronics and apparel.  Our O2C business faced unprecedented challenges as the beginning of the year was marked by severe economic contraction, leading to demand destruction and supply chain dislocations. We focussed on safe operations of all our facilities. We were probably the only company globally that operated its facilities at near full capacity and was profitable in every quarter.  Our consolidated revenues during the year were Rs. 320,008 crore, with EBITDA of Rs. 38,170 crore. We managed to maintain EBITDA margin at 11.9% despite volatility in both feedstock and product prices.  We operationalised the JV with bp in fuel retailing, using technology and innovation to deliver new customer value.  The demand and margin environment for petrochemicals had recovered to pre-COVID levels by March. I am confident that our O2C business will benefit from the strong global growth environment.  As an important part of this vision of achieving accelerated growth, we look forward to welcoming Saudi Aramco as a strategic partner in our O2C business.  Despite several challenges due to COVID-19, we have made substantial progress in the past year in our discussions. These discussions have been held in the spirit of mutual commitment to convert our long-standing relationship into a perpetual partnership.  This continued engagement and resolve from both sides, even during this pandemic, is a testimony of strong relationship between Saudi Aramco and Reliance. I expect our partnership to be formalised in an expeditious manner during this year, after obtaining required regulatory clearances.  In our E&amp;amp;amp;P business, bp and Reliance commenced production in KGD6 basin. Our JV brought two of our three toughest deep water gas projects to production. This has been accomplished in record time and set a new global benchmark for capital costs.  We are now on course to bring the third Deepwater MJ field onstream in the last quarter of 2022. Together we will produce 30 MMSCMD gas production by 2023. This will establish Reliance again as one of the largest producers of gas in India, meeting 20% of India's gas demand. E&amp;amp;amp;P will again be a source of significant value and sustained earnings growth over the next decade.  Dear Shareholders,  Today I am happy to inform you about a change in the Board of Reliance Industries Limited. Shri YP Trivedi has expressed his desire to retire from the Board. It is my duty to place on record our sincerest thanks to Trivediji. He joined our Board at the request of our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani in 1992.  On behalf of the entire Board and the shareholders, I would like to thank him from the bottom of all our hearts for his wise counsel and sage advice for nearly 30 years.  Respected Trivediji, we wish you continued good health and happiness. You are now 92 years young. May God bless you to become a Shatayushi &ndash; a centurion.  I am delighted to welcome H.E. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Chairman of Saudi Aramco and the Governor of the Public Investment Fund, to join the Board of Reliance Industries Limited as an Independent Director. He is one of the most renowned names in energy and finance globally.  I am sure that we will immensely benefit from his rich experience with one of the world's largest companies, and also one of the largest Sovereign Wealth Funds in the world.  His joining our Board is also the beginning of internationalisation of Reliance. You will hear more about our international plans in the times to come.  3. New Energy Business: Vision, Mission and Implementation Plan  Dear Shareholders,  Last year I had shared with you our vision to create the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India &ndash; our New Energy and New Materials business.  I had also announced our 15-year commitment to become net carbon zero by 2035. Today I am happy to present to you our ambitious strategy and roadmap for implementing this vision.  The world is entering a new energy era, which is going to be highly disruptive. The age of fossil fuels, which powered economic growth globally for nearly three centuries, cannot continue much longer. The huge quantities of carbon it has emitted into the environment have endangered life on Earth.  Our world has only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. The COVID pandemic has further put the climate issue in the crisis bucket.  Therefore, the global new energy agenda needs to move from dialogue to action, from commitment to urgent implementation on the ground. In reality, it is not enough to be carbon neutral; the world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  Last month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the first time presented a concrete global roadmap for the energy sector to remove all emissions by 2050. The roadmap calls for annual additions of solar Photovoltaic to increase global solar capacity from 737 GW in 2020 to about 5,000 GW by the end of 2030.  While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India and other developing nations for another reason. India is experiencing an Explosion of Aspirations  India's GDP per capita is around 2,000 dollars while the world average is around 12,000 dollars. India's power consumption per capita at present is only one third of global consumption.  This Wealth Disparity and Energy Disparity is unacceptable. Furthermore, the health, wellbeing and quality of life of every human being is in peril because of the polluted environment.  The only answer to these problems lies in Sustainable and Equitable Development in India and globally. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  How do we meet India's growing energy needs through domestic sources of energy, and not by importing carbon intensive fuels?  How do we do so in a self-reliant and affordable way which benefits 1.35 billion Indians?  These are the challenges that we face. I firmly believe that India can, India must, and India will meet these challenges.  Friends,  Today I would like to make three affirmations.  First: As one of the biggest energy markets in the world, India will play a leading role in transforming the global energy landscape.  Second: As a company always focused on growing businesses of the future, Reliance will provide leadership on the combined strength of our balance-sheet, talent, technology and proven project execution capabilities.  Third: Reliance will make its New Energy business a truly global business. In 2016, we launched Jio with the aim of bridging the Digital Divide in India.  Now, in 2021, we are launching our new energy business with the aim of bridging the green energy divide in India and globally. And we will do it &mdash; like we have always done &mdash; by getting our First Principles right.  First through Hyper-Integration: By integrating scientific knowledge with continuous technological innovation to build and operate truly integrated systems that deliver hyper-performance;  Second with a Robust business model: By building a model that catches the irreversible upward curve in the demand for green, clean and renewable energy in India and globally; and the downward curve in the cost of their production;  Third by Scale: By improving the efficiency, performance and life-cycle of our assets and operations to achieve total system optimisation and economics.  Friends,  I have no doubt that world-class talent will be the most critical resource for this new business. We have begun the process of attracting the best talent from across the world and put into place various key initiatives.  We have established the Reliance New Energy Council with some of the finest minds, globally. They will help us validate our strategies and embrace disruptive pathways to achieve our goals.  We are creating a coalition of partnerships with leading global universities, best technology companies and most promising start-ups in America, Europe, Australia and Asia. In addition, we shall leverage our existing strengths and capabilities in digitisation platforms and large-scale manufacturing.  Dear Shareholders,  I am happy to inform you that we have started work on developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest such integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. Jamnagar was the CRADLE OF OUR OLD ENERGY BUSINESS. Jamnagar will also be the CRADLE OF OUR NEW ENERGY BUSINESS. Allow me to take you through our 3-part plan.  The first part of our plan is to build Four Giga Factories.  These will manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the New Energy ecosystem. One, for the production of solar energy &mdash; we will build an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory.  Two, for the storage of intermittent energy &mdash; we will build an advanced energy storage battery factory. Three, for the production of green hydrogen &mdash; we will build an electrolyser factory.  Four, for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power &ndash; we will build a fuel cell factory.  Over the next 3 years we will invest over 60,000 crore rupees in these initiatives. Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem.  Friends,  Allow me to explain each of these facilities in some more detail.  Our first Integrated Solar Photovoltaic Giga Factory will create solar energy. We will start with raw silica and convert this to poly silicon which we will then convert to ingot and wafers. These wafers would be used to make high efficiency solar cells and finally assembled into solar modules of highest quality and durability.  We will target to achieve costs that are lowest in the world to ensure affordability of our solar modules. We are highly inspired by the goal set by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji for India to achieve 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.  Out of this, I am pleased to announce today, that Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030. A significant part of this will come from rooftop solar and decentralised solar installations in villages. These will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India.  Solar energy is available only during the day, while power is needed round the clock. Therefore, storage is an important piece of the puzzle to solve. For this, we will launch our second initiative &mdash; an Advanced Energy Storage Giga Factory.  We are exploring new and advanced electro chemical technologies that can be used for such large-scale grid batteries to store the energy that we will create. We will collaborate with global leaders in battery technology to achieve the highest reliability for round-the-clock power availability through a combination of generation, storage, and grid connectivity.  Besides Electricity, Green Hydrogen will be a unique energy vector that can enable deep decarbonization of many sectors such as transportation, industry and power. One of the most common methods of generating Green Hydrogen is by electrolysis of pure water through Electrolysers.  This brings me to our third initiative &mdash; an Electrolyser Giga Factory to manufacture modular electrolysers of highest efficiency and lowest capital cost. These can be used for captive production of green hydrogen for domestic use as well as for global sale.  And, finally, our fourth initiative will be the Fuel Cell Giga Factory. A Fuel Cell uses Oxygen from the air and Hydrogen, to generate electricity. The only emission of this process is non-polluting water vapour.  In the new era, Fuel Cells will progressively replace internal combustion engines. Fuel Cell engines can power automobiles, trucks and buses.They can also be used in stationary applications for powering data centres, telecom towers, emergency generators and micro grids and industrial equipment.  This brings me to the second part of our plan &ndash; providing infrastructure and materials to support the four Giga factories.  Our Jamnagar complex will provide infrastructure and utilities to manufacture ancillary material and equipment needed to support these Giga factories so that all critical materials are available in time. We will also support independent manufacturers with right capabilities to be part of this nationwide ecosystem.  We will invest an additional Rs. 15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries. Thus, our overall initial investment from our own internal resources in the New Energy business will be Rs. 75,000 (over $10 billion) crore in 3 years.  Now let me take you through the third part of our plan:  Over the years, Reliance has developed significant engineering, project management and construction capabilities combining physical and digital technologies.  We will repurpose these capabilities, along with major international organisations to execute and deliver world class, renewable energy solutions.  We will build two additional divisions to further strengthen this ecosystem. First, a dedicated Renewable Energy Project Management and Construction Division. Second, a dedicated Renewable Energy Project Finance Division.  The Renewable Energy Project Management and Construction Division will provide gigawatt scale end-to-end solutions for large renewable plants across the world. It will enable and partner with thousands of Green MSME Entrepreneurs, who can deploy kilowatt to megawatt scale solutions in agriculture, industry, residences and transportation.  The Renewable Energy Project Finance Division will provide finance solutions to the stakeholders in our ecosystem. We will achieve our goals by enabling a platform to source long-term global capital for these investments at the most attractive terms.  We will seek support from our relationship banks and global green funds for this purpose. Simultaneously, we will also facilitate a platform to provide financing for the entire ecosystem of small businesses and entrepreneurs who invest alongside with us.  All of these three parts together constitute our architecture for India's decentralised Green Economy. Over a period of time, it will generate millions of new and high-value job opportunities for our youth. With these new initiatives, Reliance will put Gujarat and India on world solar and hydrogen map.  All our products will proudly proclaim: Made in India, by India, for India and for the world! This will be Reliance's yet another big contribution to our Prime Minister's clarion call of Atmanirbhar Bharat.  I am certain that India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a  People's Movement.  Solar power is the primary source of energy for our Planet Earth. 'Soorya Dev' has blessed India with almost limitless sunlight.  I envision a future when our country will be transformed from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Solar Energy solutions.  Dear Friends,  Reliance is also evolving a vision for NEW MATERIALS and GREEN CHEMICALS. We will kickstart this by strategically investing in India's first world-scale CARBON FIBER plant for supporting our hydrogen and solar ecosystems. You will hear more about this in the months to come.  Our new Green Vision also has immense benefits for our existing O2C business. Allow me to take you through these:  First, we will use solar energy on an economically attractive basis to decarbonise our existing O2C business and accelerate our journey to become net carbon zero.  Second, we will use Green Hydrogen and CO2 as raw materials to develop a road map for new Green Chemicals, Green Fertilizer and e-fuels.  Third, we will commercialise with global partners our own world-beating proprietary Multi-zone Catalytic Cracking (MCC) Technology to optimise the fossil fuel transition to sustainable chemical and material building blocks.  Thus, we will transform our legacy business into sustainable, circular and net zero carbon materials business. One that will provide growing returns over several decades. And we will do this by repurposing our existing assets to extend their economic life and earning capacity. In doing so we will have no legacy asset write-downs in the coming years.  Dear Shareholders,  This twin execution plan of building a New Energy and materials ecosystem and decarbonising and repurposing our existing O2C business is a multi-decade growth path for our company. It has the potential to create unprecedented value for India and for Reliance in the coming years.  Dear Shareholders,  New Energy and New Materials are not merely another business for us.It is our mission to heal the environment. It is an expression of Reliance's commitment that WE CARE for our beautiful and bountiful planet.  By implementing our Green Vision, Reliance will help transition India and the World from an Industrial Civilisation to an Ecological Civilisation. We are repaying our debt of gratitude to Mother Nature.  Dear Shareholders,  Let me tell you, in all humility, that New Energy is the most exciting, most challenging and most purpose-driven mission I will be pursuing in my life. I seek your blessings and support for success in this mission.  4. Reliance Jio  Dear Friends,  Let me now turn to JIO, our digital services initiative.  In spite of COVID, JIO sustained its track record of robust performance. JIO became the first operator outside China to cross 400 million mobile subscribers in a single country.  We are truly grateful to all our valued customers. Thanks to them, JIO is today the world's second largest mobile data carrier handling monthly traffic of over 630 crore GIGABYTES.  This is nearly 45% growth in data consumption in the last year alone, a testament to the rapid pace at which India is digitizing.  More significantly, JIO continued to be the digital lifeline binding Indians together despite social distancing, lockdowns and working-from-home. During the past year, we also made the necessary capital investments to further strengthen our market position and growth.  During recent spectrum auctions, we invested Rs. 57,123 crore to acquire significant additional spectrum, making JIO the largest operator of 4G spectrum in India. And we have operationalized nearly 100% of this additional spectrum.  When combined with another Rs. 15,183 crore we invested in further expanding our network infrastructure, JIO has raised the bar even higher for service quality and JIO's leadership is evident across India along all key metrics like indoor coverage, download speeds and video experience.  More importantly these investments have also created the capacity to on-board an additional 200 million customers on JIO's network thereby bringing digital empowerment to even more Indians.  Friends,  JIO has truly democratized digital connectivity in India by offering the highest quality, most affordable 4G broadband  services in the world. Even so, India still has nearly 300 million mobile users who are unable to escape from inefficient and exorbitant 2G services because even a basic 4G smartphone remains unaffordable for these users.  Therefore, an ultra-affordable 4G smartphone is essential to make India &ldquo;2G-mukt&rdquo;. Last year, Sundar and I had talked about Google and JIO co-developing a next-generation, feature-rich, but extremely affordable smartphone, aimed at providing first-time internet access for 2G users.  Today, I am pleased to announce that Google and JIO teams have jointly developed a truly breakthrough Smartphone, that we are calling JIOPHONE Next.  JIOPHONE Next is a fully featured smartphone, supporting the entire suite of applications from both Google and Jio, as well as the Android Play Store through which users will have access to the entire universe of Android Apps.  JIOPHONE Next is powered by an extremely optimised version of the Android Operating System, that has been jointly developed by JIO and Google, especially for the Indian market.  While being ultra-affordable, JIOPHONE Next is packed with cutting-edge features like the voice assistant, automatic read-aloud of screen text, language translation, smart camera with augmented reality filters and much more.  This is a testimony to a global technology giant and a national technology champion working jointly to make a break- through product, that can be first introduced in India and then taken to the rest of the world.  JIOPHONE Next will be available in the market from the auspicious date of Ganesh Chaturthi, 10th September this year,  And as you have come to expect from Jio, it is my promise that JIOPHONE Next will be by far, amongst the most affordable smartphone not just in India, but globally.  Let me now invite my good friend Sundar to talk about JioPhone Next, and other areas of collaboration between Google and JIO.  Sundar Pichai Speech:  &ldquo;Thank you to Mukesh, Nita, Akash, and Isha - and to everyone at Reliance Industries for all you do for India&hellip;  From investing in infrastructure and technology... to creating jobs and expanding opportunity&hellip; to supporting communities in need, especially in this difficult moment for the country.  It's been devastating to see the country hit so hard by COVID-19. Yet it's heartening to see how Reliance has stepped up to contribute to the national response and get support to the communities that need it most.  On behalf of all of us at Google: we hope you are taking care...and are wishing for better days ahead.  For Google, the past year has brought renewed purpose and greater urgency to our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.  At a time when so many aspects of our lives and work are moving online, it's even more important to make technology accessible and helpful for everyone.  This goal is at the heart of our partnership with Reliance Jio. I was proud to help launch this partnership last year.  It was the first and biggest equity investment from the Rs. 75,000 crore Google for India Digitization Fund.  Our vision was to bring affordable access to information for Indians in their own language... to build new products and services for India's unique needs... and empower businesses with technology.  I'm excited that today, we can announce the next steps in this vision: Starting with a new, affordable, Jio smartphone, created with Google.  Our teams have optimised a version of our Android OS especially for this device. It will offer language and translation features, a great camera, and support for the latest Android updates.  It is built for India&hellip; And it will open up new possibilities for millions of new users who will experience the internet for the very first time&hellip;. And we can't wait to show you the device later this year.  I'm also proud to announce that we are taking our collaboration further&hellip; with a new 5G partnership between Google Cloud and Jio.  It will help more than a billion Indians connect to a faster and better internet... support businesses in their digital transformation&hellip; and help Jio build new services in sectors like health, education and more &mdash; laying a foundation for the next phase of India's digitization.  As part of this collaboration, Reliance will also shift its core retail businesses to Google Cloud's infrastructure.  They will be able take advantage of Google's AI and machine learning, ecommerce, and demand forecasting offerings.  Harnessing the reliability and performance of Google Cloud will enable these businesses to scale up as needed to respond to customer demand.  Empowering businesses as they embark on their digital transformation is a key part of our mission in India, and I'm excited for the innovations this partnership will help unleash.  We are proud to play a part in India's next wave of technological innovation.  Helping to connect 1.3 billion Indians to the opportunities the internet creates is meaningful to all of us at Google -- and certainly to me personally.  I know that with greater access to smartphones and improved connectivity, there's no limit to what India's people can do.  We look forward to getting technology into the hands of more people...and to exploring what more we can achieve together in the years ahead.  Thank you.&rdquo; Thank you, Sundar. We greatly value our partnership with Google. Friends,  As Sundar mentioned, Cloud and Cloud solutions, is another area where we are collaborating with Google. JIO will use Google Cloud's cutting-edge technologies to power JIO's 5G Solutions and for powering the internal needs of key Reliance growth businesses like Reliance Retail, JioMart, JioSaavn and JioHealth.  Friends,  We have also made significant progress in the collaborations that we announced last year.  Let me start with FACEBOOK - We have launched an initial set of integrations between WhatsApp and JioMart on a trial basis and the response from WhatsApp and JioMart customers is encouraging along with lots of valuable feedback. Our joint teams are actively developing the full New Commerce solution linking merchants and consumers, and we plan to progressively launch these over the next few quarters.  With MICROSOFT - We have operationalized an initial 10 MW capacity of JIO-AZURE Cloud Data centres in two cities, Jamnagar and Nagpur. We are currently onboarding the initial group of pilot customers and we plan to expand our data centre capacity and our offerings to a growing number of SMEs and start-ups over the coming quarters.  We are indeed privileged to have partners like Facebook, Google and Microsoft, in whose company, our efforts to create a DIGITAL SOCIETY in India seems that much easier.  Friends,  Across the world, the past 15 months have been challenging for on-the-ground physical work.  JIOFIBER, JIO's optical fiber-based, gigabit speed, fixed broadband services has also faced similar challenges. The pace of Optical fiber deployment, building-connectivity and home-installations have all been slower than expected because of lockdowns and other restrictions across our country.  Despite this, I am glad to announce that JIOFIBER has acquired more than 2 million new premises over the past year, following all safety protocols for our customers and employees. Now, with a cumulative base of 3 million active home and business users, JIOFIBER has become the largest and the fastest growing fixed broadband operator in India.  Data consumption on JIOFIBER has grown to more than 3.5 times compared to a year ago. Today, JIO's optical-fiber network is physically present outside more than 12 million homes and business premises, with a deep fiber footprint in the top 100 cities.  I continue to be confident of a rapid uptake of JIOFIBER services and revenue growth for JIO as India recovers from COVID.  Dear Shareholders,  I announced last year that JIO's engineers have developed a 100% home-grown and comprehensive 5G solution which is fully cloud native, software defined, and digitally managed.  Jio has taken tremendous strides in maturing this state-of-the-art Standalone 5G technology, which signifies a quantum leap to the next frontier of wireless broadband. Together with our partners, we have tested the JIO 5G solutions in India and we successfully demonstrated speeds well in excess of 1 GBPS. Our 'Made in India' solution is comprehensive, complete and globally competitive. It reaffirms my faith in the abundant talent of Indian engineers to deliver world class products in such a cutting-edge technology.  Recently, we received the necessary regulatory approvals... as well as trial spectrum for initiating 5G field-trials. As I speak to you, the entire 5G Standalone Network has been installed in our data centres across the nation and also at our trial sites in Navi Mumbai.  We are confident of being the first to launch full-fledged 5G services. And because of our converged, future-proof architecture JIO's network is uniquely positioned to quickly and seamlessly upgrade from 4G to 5G.  To develop the end-to-end 5G ecosystem we are now working with leading global partners to develop a full range of 5G-capable devices. The Jio 5G technology is well positioned to create compelling applications for consumers and enterprises spanning Healthcare, Education, Entertainment, Retail and other key verticals of the economy.  One exciting 5G-enabled solution that JIO is developing with Sir H. N. Reliance Foundation Hospital is a state-of-the- art Connected Ambulance. With real-time, high-fidelity Telemedicine and remote doctor access, each Connected Ambulance can become a virtual extension of a hospital emergency room even while on the move.  We are developing with Reliance Foundation schools to use 5G to deliver immersive and interactive AR/ VR content to students and classrooms making the learning process a delightful, memorable and enriching experience.  We hope that such showcases will catalyse the emergence of a vibrant, local 5G ecosystem making India a global hub for 5G development and export. So JIO is not just working to make India 2G-MUKT&hellip; but also 5G-YUKT.  And, once JIO's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, we are excited by the prospect of exporting JIO 5G solutions to other telecom operators across the world.  Friends,  JIO has developed deep expertise in multiple emerging technologies like 5G, AI/ML and blockchain and Mixed Reality. We are developing 100% owned Intellectual Property&hellip;  We have access to deep domain knowledge and operational experience within the Reliance Group across key Industry verticals.  We have a passionate and talented team&hellip; and world-class partners and we have the opportunity to serve a global audience.  In all, JIO PLATFORMS is blossoming into a global technology player&hellip; capable of creating multifold societal, customer and shareholder value for years to come.  5. Reliance Retail  Dear Shareholders,  Now let me talk about Reliance Retail.  This past year was the true test for our business. Despite challenging and restrictive operating conditions, Reliance Retail continued to deliver industry leading returns.  We added 1,500 new stores, which is amongst the largest retail expansion undertaken by any retailer during this period, taking our store count to 12,711.  We continue to maintain and strengthen our leadership position. Today one in every eight Indians shops with Reliance Retail.  My Dear Shareholders,  Let me present some of the highlights for this year:  Our apparel business sold nearly five lakh units per day and over 18 crore units during the year. This is equivalent to dressing the entire population of UK, Germany and Spain once.  Ajio has emerged as one of the leading digital commerce platforms for fashion and lifestyle with a portfolio of over 2,000 labels and brands and listing of over 5 lakh options. Driven by innovation, Ajio now contributes to over 25% of our apparel business.  We further consolidated our position in consumer electronics and sold 4.5 crore units of electronics last year which translates to over 120,000 units per day.  Our Omni commerce capabilities allow us to deliver an unparalleled service proposition across 1,300 cities.  As India's largest grocery retailer, Reliance Retail sold over a billion units of groceries or about 30 lakh units per day. Our grocery staff operated on the frontlines of crisis ensuring availability of essential products to our customers and kirana partners.  JioMart registered over 6.5 lakh peak orders in a single day. JioMart's growth is a testament to its already loyal customer base, 80% of whom are repeat shoppers. JioMart New commerce's aim is to transform and grow the small merchant ecosystem, so our merchant partners prosper.  Over the past year, over 3 lakh merchant or shop keeper partners across 150 cities were enabled and empowered to transform their businesses both physically and digitally.  Our promise to them is simple:  'Customer Apka, Support Hamara' &mdash; We support you, so that you can serve your customers better&rsquo;  A testament to our promise is that we have seen a 3x growth in kirana orders and 2x growth in order frequency. Expansion across cities is well underway and we will onboard over One Crore merchant partners over the next three years.  This will trigger a socio-economic transformation on an extraordinary scale in India, especially when coupled with our mission of employment generation.  Even in these challenging times, I am personally proud to report to you that Reliance Retail has not only protected jobs, but also created over 65,000 new jobs. Reliance Retail currently employs over 2 lakh people making us one of the largest employers in the country. Over the next three years, we shall further create employment for over ten lakh people and enable the livelihoods for many more.  Growth in the retail sector will usher growth across the value chain &mdash; from raw material producers to large and small manufacturers, from logistics service providers to merchants, to Consumers. In order to expand this circle of shared prosperity, we will be focussing on the following five key initiatives:  First, we will further invest in our research, design and product development capabilities. In the next year we will set up design, research, technology and innovation centres in key areas globally and nationally to develop differentiated offerings for our diverse customer groups.  Second, we will further strengthen our sourcing ecosystem working closely with producers, MSMEs, service providers, local and international brand companies. We will make them our partners in the journey of value creation that our New Commerce model seeks to unlock.  Third, we are investing in building state-of-the-art supply chain infrastructure across India by linking all major sourcing and consumption locations. This will maximise efficiencies and minimise losses in the supply chain, so that we can share the gains with both consumers and producers.  An automated, modular, reliable and scalable warehousing and logistics ecosystem will enable us to deliver products anywhere across the country in the shortest possible time.  Fourth, we will focus on expanding our store footprint multi-fold this year with co-located delivery hubs over the next few years. They will provide a strong network to reach and serve millions of merchants and customers.  And fifth, we will continue acquiring businesses to heighten our offering and experience to customers, sharpen our omni-channel capabilities, drive operating efficiencies and strengthen our talent pool. Recent acquisitions include leading physical/digital commerce platforms like Netmeds, Urban Ladder and Zivame.  Reliance Retail continues to be amongst the fastest growing retailers in the world. We are committed to grow our business so that we are among the top 10 retailers globally. I am confident that Reliance Retail is on a hyper growth trajectory to grow at least 3x in the next 3-5 years.  6. Media Business  Dear Shareowners,  Network18 successfully overcame the logistical and business challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the pandemic, our journalists continue to venture out into the field every day so that viewers and readers get relevant information from inside the safety of their homes.  Our entertainment flagship brand, Colors, was the first to resume fresh programming after the first wave of lockdowns, being true to its mission of keeping India entertained with wholesome and creative fare.  7. Value Creation  I now will like to present our Value Creation roadmap.  Your company has a proven track record of creating maximum societal value and maximum shareholder value through our business operations as well as philanthropic initiatives. The year has proved, beyond doubt, the resilience of our businesses and our ability to continuously innovate to create value even in adverse conditions.  You are well aware of Reliance's epic journey &mdash; from being a small textile company that had its IPO less than 50 years ago to joining the ranks of 50 most valuable companies in the world.  Reliance is probably the only large company in the world that has successfully transformed itself from being a traditional industrial business into an enterprise that now includes two mega-scale consumer and technology businesses.  Both Jio and Retail are at the beginning of their journey. Yet, both have an embedded culture of continuous value creation. Both have also brought immense benefits to hundreds of millions of consumers by mastering the power of revolutionary new technologies.  Our O2C business combined with our new energy and materials plan will usher in a new era of exponential growth.  In the last 10 years, Reliance invested over USD 90 billion in creating substantial wealth for the nation and value for the shareholders. In the coming decade, Reliance has the capacity to catalyse investments of over USD 200 billion directly and through partners.  These investments will create value on an exponential scale. They will based on our disciplined capital allocation approach, preference for pursuing asset light strategies and emphasis on superior investment grade ratings.  These investments will also create over 10 lakh new employment opportunities, besides fostering thousands of small and medium enterprises across the country.  I assure you that your Company will consistently increase payout to its shareholders as our earnings continue to grow. I am confident that Reliance's multiple investment and business announcements today will help in kick-starting growth in the Indian economy.  I believe speedy recovery in the post-COVID period is beyond any doubt. But beyond recovery, there will be rapid resurgence. I have no doubt that India is destined to emerge as one of the top three economies in the world.  And as your company in its Golden Decade transforms itself as New Reliance, it is destined to play a proud role in the emergence of a New India.  My Most Esteemed Shareholders,  My father Dhirubhai founded Reliance on the principles of investing in future technologies, investing in Indian talent, and investing in India's growth opportunity.  I have continued the tradition of following his evergreen principles while growing Reliance as a world-class enterprise.  As Reliance climbs new summits of success in its onward journey, it will also cross new milestones in being a CARING and EMPATHETIC CORPORATE CITIZEN.  But believe me: The Best of Reliance is yet to come!  I have no doubt whatsoever that the next generation of leaders at Reliance, led by Isha, Akash and Anant, will further enrich this precious legacy.  8. Concluding Remarks  Dear Shareholders,  We are meeting at a time when the second wave of the Covid pandemic is fast receding.  Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Central Government and all the State Governments, along with civil society organisations and corporates, have co-ordinated a massive effort in this fight.  But as a company, as a country, as mankind &mdash; and each one of us as individuals &mdash; we have learnt an important lesson. We must be far better prepared to face such crises in future and never let our guard down.  To achieve this, the most essential resource we need &mdash; which is also the most useful resource &mdash; is a POSITIVE MINDSET.  In trying times like these, POSITIVITY acts like a highly effective medicine. It works wonders for individuals, families and for the society.  Despair weakens us. Determination strengthens us. Negativity numbs us with pessimism and inaction. Positivity provides us with hope and confidence. Our ancient civilisation has survived many crises in its long history.  Because our forefathers had UNLIMITED POSITIVITY and SELF-BELIEF.  My father, Dhirubhai Ambani, used to say, &ldquo;Challenge negative forces with hope, self-confidence and conviction, and the ambition and initiative will ultimately triumph.&rdquo; I have absolutely no doubt that India will conquer the COVID crisis &mdash; sooner rather than later.  Post COVID, India will emerge stronger. It will be a Better India, a Resurgent India, a more Equal India, and a far more Self-Confident India.  I foresee that the Indian economy will bounce back at a rate that will surprise the world. And prosperity and opportunities will be created for all on a scale never seen before. Not for a few, but for all 1.35 billion Indians.  Indeed, I see the global economy resetting itself in ways that will create a more EQUAL WORLD. May God forever guide us along this path.  9. Acknowledgements  I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, lenders, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.  I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their oversight in this crucial phase of our growth, their support and immense encouragement.  I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly to create and sustain a world-class enterprise.  Thank you!  &amp;amp;nbsp;  June 24, 2021  Text of the speech ends here.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, the Vice President of&nbsp;IIFL Institutional Equities talks about the expectations from RIL's upcoming AGM, moats for the company, growing contribution of&nbsp;Jio and Retail and much more.&nbsp;Edited Excerpts:  Q: Reliance Industries' Annual General Meeting is scheduled to be held on June 24. What are your&nbsp;expectations from the event?  In the past 12 months, RIL has not only mobilised funds aggregating Rs 2,16,400 crore to de-leverage its balance sheet but also inducted strategic investors in its high growth businesses such as organised retail (Reliance Retail) and technology (Jio). In this context, RIL is expected to share the value added by each of these stakeholders to the individual businesses, how the individual businesses are shaping up, and what should be the growth/investment outlook.  Some comments are expected towards value unlocking in its O2C business, where outlook on margins is improving, given the pick up in global consumption. Media articles also suggest that RIL may induct Aramco's CEO on its board which would be seen as a step towards a much larger partnership between the two conglomerates.  Also read -&nbsp;RIL AGM on June 24 | Goldman Sachs expects the retail business to be the next growth engine  Investors are also expecting some comments on 1) progress and possible launch dates for the smartphone being developed by Jio and Google jointly; 2) roadmap for the listing of Reliance Retail and 3) progress to induct a strategic investor in O2C business.  RIL Chairman in the last AGM outlined ambitions to become a net carbon zero company by 2035. Investors would keenly await the strategy adopted by RIL to achieve this target, as it would significantly improve its positioning on the ESG (Environmental Social &amp;amp;amp; Governance) framework.  Q: What is the reason behind your bullish view on Reliance Industries; any price targets?&nbsp;  RIL's consolidated earnings are set to register a 17 percent per annum growth through FY21-23ii &ndash; on the back of - 1) recovery in the O2C business: cyclical recovery in gross refining margin (GRMs) aided by pick up in consumption across the globe clubbed with strength in petchem deltas; 2) 34 percent growth in Jio's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) (10 percent per annum growth in ARPU assumed); 3) 26 percent per annum growth in EBITDA of Reliance Retail, as we build in 14 percent per annum growth in the area under operations and improving revenue and profit margins. The earnings growth has an upside, provided the GRM (gross refining margin) improvement is ahead of estimate and recovery in retail sales growth is sharper. For a $1 per barrel change in GRMs, the earnings swing by 6 percent, while a 10 percent change in sales growth for Retail causes a consolidated PAT change of 2 percent.  In the base case, we value RIL at Rs 2,200 per share, near the CMP (current market price), but the stock can offer significant upsides with the following events: 1) value unlocking in the O2C segment (induction of strategic investor); 2) successful consummation of Future Retail's business which as of now is under litigation.

How much do you see it contributing by 2025?  The business outlook on Jio's operations is improving. The recently launched Jio Phone with attractive plans, the upcoming launch of the Google phone, and the capacity boost from a 45 percent increase in spectrum holdings post-March auctions are likely to result in higher subscriber adds in the next few months (notwithstanding some weakness in April and May due to the second wave of Covid).  With Vodafone Idea facing large cash outflows from December 2021, we see either industry-wide price hikes or accelerated market share loss for Vodafone Idea. Jio stands to benefit in either case. The progress on the FTTH (Fiber to the home) business remains steady. The key trigger to watch out for in the near term would be the pricing of the smartphone to be launched in collaboration with Google and the plans. IIFL expects Jio to contribute 13 percent to RIL&rsquo;s consolidated revenues by FY23.  Q: Do you think Reliance Industries will raise more funds for its retail and Jio businesses in the coming years?  RIL, through FY21, raised Rs 1.52 lakh crore and Rs 37,700 crore through induction of strategic investors in Jio and retail, respectively. The management commentary on capex intensity in each of these businesses is lowering at a time when the visibility on cash flows is set to improve. As such, the balance sheet of RIL and individual businesses is strong enough to pursue organic growth initiatives and bolster their competitive positioning in their respective addressable markets. We, however, expect RIL to induct a strategic investor in the O2C business sometime in the next 12-18 months and unlock value.  Q: Do you think Reliance will complete its stake sale in O2C business by 2022?  RIL has one of the most complex and integrated O2C business operations. Its deep integration helps to offset the impact of volatility in the feedstock prices and the product cracks on its O2C profits. While it is pursuing partnerships with global firms which can add value to its operations and enhance shareholders value, it would be inappropriate to comment on the timelines. This is because of two key reasons: first, the strategic partnerships are usually not forged by keeping specific timelines in mind, and secondly, it is a function of growth strategy outlined, ability to add value in the relationship, and valuation benchmarks. RIL Chairman, in the last AGM, said that active negotiations with Aramco were underway.  Q: What is your view on Reliance Retail and will it contribute more than the telecom segment, to total revenue in coming years?  RIL's retail business has ramped up faster than our estimates, particularly the store additions, in a challenging macro environment. While the near term outlook is tricky, given the 2nd wave of COVID and resultant impact on footfalls, we like RIL's approach of focusing on omni-channel offerings, and strengthening the supply chain, while ramping up the JioMart / digital sales channel. Our FY22ii EBITDA assumes normal operations for 3 quarters; FY23ii EBITDA growth of 25 percent YoY has upside, given the pace of current ramp up in operations. Our forecasts assume 23 percent-32 percent sales growth in FY22/23ii and EBITDA margins of 6.1/6.3 percent versus 5.5 percent seen in FY21ii.  RIL's proposed takeover of the retailing and logistics business assets of the Future group is facing legal issues, and awaits SC judgment. Future Retail's asset takeover will help RIL fast track its ambitions to grow the footprint in the organized retail segment. As such, the 26 percent per annum EBITDA growth forecast in the retail business is without integrating the assets of Future Retail. Takeover, if completed in the next 6-8 months, can add Rs 1,00,000-1,20,000 crore enterprise value to RIL's retailing business.  By FY23, we forecast Reliance Retail to register Rs 2,27,000 crore sales, and contribute 26 percent to the consolidated sales. These revenues would be almost 106 percent higher than estimated revenues of the telecom segment.

The key focus in the past several AGMs was largely on telecom and retail businesses which&nbsp;collectively&nbsp;provided revenue of Rs 2.44 lakh crore in FY21; experts believe this time&nbsp;will be no different.  In FY21, as per its targets, Reliance had the largest fundraise in Jio Platforms as well as Reliance Retail. Reliance Retail raised Rs 47,265 crore for a 10.09 percent stake from marquee global investors, while its telecom and digital services company Jio Platforms garnered Rs 1.52 lakh crore from several global investors including Google, Facebook and Intel.  In the last AGM, before stake sale in Reliance Retail,&nbsp;the company&nbsp;had raised a total of Rs 2,12,809 crore&nbsp;from Rights Issue, investments in Jio Platforms, and investment by BP, which largely helped the conglomerate become&nbsp;net-debt free, much ahead of its target of March 2021.  The company has been in the process to spin off its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business into a separate subsidiary. &amp;quot;The scheme for transfer of O2C undertaking to a wholly-owned subsidiary has been filed with the National Company Law Tribunal and is pending approval. The said scheme has been approved by the creditors and shareholders of the company,&amp;quot; said Reliance Industries in its FY21 earnings press release.

Also, announcements regarding&nbsp;the RIL-Aramco deal, the launch of 5G and new tech products &amp;amp;amp; services&nbsp;are expected in the AGM, Nair said.  RIL,&nbsp;in its recent earnings press release, said Jio was conducting field trials for fine-tuning network performance and configurations for its 5G network, and work was also ongoing on standardising 5G device configurations by collaborating with&nbsp;original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  Reliance further said it has scaled up JioMart to become a truly horizontal platform with a presence across Grocery, Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Lifestyle, Digital and Pharma. In addition, JioMart has all the technological functionalities that should enable it to become&nbsp;a diverse third-party platform, it added.  Reliance Industries shares gained 22.2 percent since its last AGM held on July 15, 2020. Yea-to-date, the stock&nbsp;is 13.6 percent.

RIL, which has a track record of meeting its target ahead of deadlines, is expected to make announcements&nbsp;across its&nbsp;telecom, retail and O2C business.  &amp;quot;In the upcoming AGM, Reliance is likely to announce kickstarting 5G services which might begin in late 2021. Moreover, 5G phones are likely to be revealed in the AGM which might be another interesting development to watch out for,&amp;quot; Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research told Moneycontrol.  In the last AGM, Chairman Mukesh Ambani said Jio designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch, enabling the company to launch a world-class 5G service in India, using 100 percent homegrown technologies and solutions.  &amp;quot;This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available&hellip; and can be ready for field deployment next year. And because of JIO's converged, all-IPnetwork architecture&hellip; we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G,&amp;quot;&nbsp;Ambani said.  &amp;quot;Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio Platforms would be well-positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally, as a complete managed service,&amp;quot; he added.  &amp;quot;We believe we can design entry-level 4 or even 5G smartphone&nbsp;for a fraction of its current cost. Through the partnership with Google, we are confident that we can accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian.&amp;quot;  According to Gaurav Garg, JioBook, the low-cost laptops, is another attraction that might lure investors.  Garg said announcement over dividend declaration and bonus&nbsp;can also be expected&nbsp;in this AGM.  &amp;quot;Reliance likes to keep the market price of shares around Rs 1,000 so we might get to see 1:1 bonus announcement,&amp;quot; he said.  Earlier this month, Reliance Industries fixed June 14, 2021, as the record date for the purpose of determining the members eligible to receive the dividend for the financial year 2020-21.  The dividend, if declared at the AGM, will be paid within a week from the conclusion of the AGM, the company said.  Further, Gaurav Garg feels specific announcements are expected on the progress of Saudi Aramco deal in O2C business as well as Future Retail merger in the retail space.  The stock of RIL has rallied 12.1 percent&nbsp;so far in 2021. In the last 12 months, it has&nbsp;climbed 34.4 percent.

The upmove comes after the stock underperformed for almost&nbsp;five&nbsp;months versus broader markets. After reaching a high of Rs 2,369 a share in September 2020, the stock saw a correction of almost 22 percent and consolidated at around Rs 1,900,&nbsp;against this backdrop, the stock's upmove is notable.  What are the triggers for RIL going ahead?  The rally on May 28 can be attributed to several factors, including some non-fundamental elements, hence, we believe it is best not to analyse all these aspects in depth. Rather, we see three key drivers for the stock: 1) improving outlook on each business segment; 2) value unlocking in the O2C business and 3) inorganic growth initiatives.  1 Improving business outlook  The outlook for each of RIL's business segments is improving, and we forecast RIL's consolidated earnings to register&nbsp;CAGR (compound annual growth rate)&nbsp;of 19 percent through FY21-23ii. The growth is likely to be broad-based, rather than concentrated in any specific segment. During this period, we forecast the share of RIL's B2C businesses in overall EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at 53-58 percent versus 50 percent in FY21. Consider this:  a) O2C: Integration benefits will play now  RIL's O2C (oil-to-chemical) business is uniquely placed, given its refinery-petrochem integration. While we think petchem margins should soften relative to the current trends, gross refining margins (GRMs) should revive over the next 12 months, with pick up in global oil consumption. And, to that extent, we see low risk to our Rs 44,700 crore/Rs 47,500 crore EBITDA in the O2C segment through FY22ii/23ii, respectively.  If the global recovery is stronger in FY23, there is an upside risk to our estimates. However, it is too early to factor this in. The exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P)&nbsp; business, though relatively smaller compared to O2C, has also surprised positively. We factor-in KG D6 sales volumes of 15/18mmscmd through FY22/23ii, respectively, and assume no material changes in its realisations&mdash;around $4 per million British thermal unit (mmbtu).  b) Jio: Heads I win, tails you lose  The recently launched attractive Jio phone plans, the upcoming launch of Google phone and the capacity boost from the 45 percent increase in spectrum holdings after March auctions are likely to result in higher subscriber additions in the next few months (notwithstanding some weakness in April and May due to the second wave of COVID). We do not see significant price hikes in the next six months.  With Vi (Vodafone Idea) facing large cash outflows from December 2021, we forecast either industry-wide price hikes or an accelerated market-share loss for Vi, Jio stands to benefit in any case. Progress on the FTTH (fibre to the home) business remains steady. The key near-term trigger to watch out for would be the pricing of the smartphone to be launched in collaboration with Google and the plans.  Also read: Reliance Industries annual report key highlights: From strong liquidity to growth plans for Jio  c) Retail: Solid ramp up in operations  RIL's retail business, particularly store additions, has ramped up faster than our estimates in a challenging macro environment. While the near-term outlook is moot, given the second COVID wave and the resultant impact on footfalls, we like RIL&rsquo;s approach of focussing on omni-channel offerings and strengthening its supply chain, while ramping up the JioMart/digital sales channel.  Our FY22ii EBITDA assumes normal operations for three quarters; FY23ii EBITDA growth of 25 percent YoY has an upside, given the pace of the current ramp-up in operations. We, nonetheless, will wait for the current macro environment to phase out. Our forecasts assume 23&nbsp;percent and 32 percent sales growth estimates in FY22 ad FY23 and EBITDA margins of 6.1&nbsp;and 6.3 percent versus 5.5 percent seen in FY21ii.    RIL's reported net cash, as of FY21, stood at Rs 2,200 crore and adjusted for the deferred spectrum liabilities and creditors for Capex, net financial liabilities were seen at Rs 83,400 crore. We think that by FY22, RIL shall be able to prune the net debt by 69 percent to Rs 25,900 crore, given the completion of the rights issue and operational cash flows. As such, the capex intensity is incrementally lowering. Effectively by FY23, RIL should be a net-cash company, which bodes well for shareholders.  Also read: Reliance Industries sees big opportunity in global consensus against climate change  2 Value unlocking in O2C business  RIL is set to transfer its O2C business to a 100 percent subsidiary in FY22. The company is also well poised to induct a strategic investor in this business, which will fast-track its growth plans in the segment and meet the net carbon zero target by 2035.  In the base case, we value the business at an enterprise value (EV) of $63&nbsp;billion, and strategic stake sale to a global player such as Aramco at a higher valuation (eg $75&nbsp;billion) will help unlock the value.  3 Inorganic growth initiatives  RIL's proposed takeover of the retailing and logistics business assets of the Future Group is facing legal issues and awaits the Supreme Court judgment. FRL's (Future Retail) asset takeover will help RIL fast-track ambitions to grow its footprint in the organised retail segment.  As such, the 26 percent per annum EBITDA&nbsp;growth forecast in the retail business is without integrating the assets of FRL. Take over, if completed in the next six-eight months, can add Rs 1,00,000-1,20,000 crore EV to RIL&rsquo;s retailing business.  Also read: Jio accelerating rollout of digital platforms, indigenously-developed 5G stack: RIL annual report  What should investors do with RIL stock?  We maintain our positive bias on the stock. We value RIL's O2C business at $63&nbsp;billion; note that such valuation is lower by 16 percent versus the speculated $75-billion valuation attributed to the possible stake sale to ARAMCO.  IIFL's telecom&nbsp;team values Jio's EV at $82.9&nbsp;billion, which is based on discounted cash flow (DCF) and assumes revenue market share (RMS) of 51 percent in a steady state, post FY24.  We now value Reliance Retail at EV of $67&nbsp;billion, based on 35x FY23ii EBITDA. We are impressed by the pace of sales&nbsp;per EBITDA&nbsp;ramp-up at Reliance Retail and the faster-than-expected normalisation of operations would compel us to move the retail valuation even higher.  Reliance Retail successfully consummating the FRL acquisition could lead to significant value creation for the overall retail business. Our base case does not ascribe any option value for such a takeover. Against this backdrop, we value RIL at SoTP of Rs 2,200&nbsp;per share.  If RIL is able to induct a strategic investor at $75&nbsp;billion valuation, the SoTP (Sum of the parts) would move up by Rs 133&nbsp;per share; the FRL acquisition can lead to an uptick in SoTP by Rs 172&nbsp;per share over the next 12-18 months. And if the much-awaited increases in telecom ARPU come through (say tariff hikes of Rs 50 in the next 12-18 months), RIL's SoTP swings up by around Rs 200&nbsp;per share.    We reiterate our &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; rating on RIL and believe the stock will remain sensitive to news flow on the deal with ARAMCO and the Supreme Court verdict on Future Retail.

RIL said it has ramped up production of medical grade oxygen from zero to 1,000 metric tonne per day and is ensuring swift supply of the resource across states and Union Territories.  &ldquo;Traditionally, Reliance is not a manufacturer of medical grade liquid oxygen. Yet, starting from nil before the pandemic, Reliance Industries has now become India&rsquo;s largest producer of this life-saving resource from a single location,&rdquo; RIL said in a media statement.  &ldquo;At its refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Jamnagar and other facilities, RIL now produces over 1,000 MT of medical grade liquid oxygen per day &mdash; or over 11 percent of India&rsquo;s total production &ndash; meeting the needs of nearly every one in ten patients,&rdquo; the company added.  This oxygen is being provided free of cost to several states across India &ldquo;to bring immediate relief to over 1 lakh patients&rdquo; each day, RIL said.  The conglomerate added that it had reconfigured and optimised its operations designed for refining and petrochemicals grade oxygen to produce high-purity medical grade oxygen despite not being a manufacturer of medical grade liquid oxygen before the pandemic.    Commenting on these initiatives, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited, said: &ldquo;For me and for all of us at Reliance, nothing is more important than saving every life as India battles against a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an immediate need to maximise India&rsquo;s production and transportation capacities for medical grade oxygen. I am proud of our engineers at Jamnagar who have worked tirelessly, with a great sense of patriotic urgency, to meet this new challenge.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I am truly humbled by the determination and sense of purpose shown by the bright, young members of the Reliance family who have once again risen to the occasion and delivered when India needs it the most,&rdquo; Ambani added.  &amp;quot;Our country is going through an unprecedented crisis. We at Reliance Foundation will continue to do everything we can to help. Every life is precious. Our plants at our Jamnagar refinery have been repurposed overnight to produce medical grade liquid oxygen that is being distributed across India. Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow countrymen and women. Together, we will overcome these difficult times,&rdquo; Nita Ambani, Founder-Chairperson of the Reliance Foundation, said.    Reliance said it had supplied over 55,000 MT of medical grade liquid oxygen across the country since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.  To overcome the transportation bottlenecks in supply, &ldquo;Reliance engineers made smart logistical modifications to rail and road transport, such as laying parallel lines, using hoses and loading up liquid tankers through pressure differential, since liquid oxygen pumps cannot be installed at short notice,&rdquo; the company said.  Nitrogen tankers were converted to transport trucks for medical grade oxygen through processes approved by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO), the relevant regulatory body of the Government of India, RIL added.  RIL also said it had organised airlifting of 24 ISO containers into India from Saudi Arabia, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Thailand adding 500 MT of new transportation capacity for liquid oxygen. &ldquo;These containers will help in removing the transport constraints for medical grade liquid oxygen in the country.&rdquo;  The company thanked Aramco, BP and the Indian Air Force (IAF) for their help in providing and transporting ISO containers, adding that more ISO containers will be airfreighted over the next few days.

Despite COVID related challenges, Jio Platforms closed its first full year of operations with revenue from operations and EBITDA of Rs 73,503 crore and Rs 32,359 crore, respectively.

As hospitals in New Delhi run short on oxygen, funeral pyres burn across the capital and residents wonder which city will get overwhelmed next, local markets are ticking along in the expectation of attractive returns. Fund managers have turned net sellers of local equities after six months of inflows. The benchmark Nifty 50 just had its best day in almost a month, however, and the MSCI India Index is up over the period too. The India basket trades at an exuberant multiple of nearly 21 times projected earnings for the year, a premium to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. After depreciating earlier in the month, the rupee is rebounding too. Multiple factors underpin the optimism despite more than 360,000 new cases in 24 hours on Wednesday. India&rsquo;s economy is slowing but less harshly than during last year&rsquo;s lockdown. There&rsquo;s confidence in a faster vaccine rollout, as well. Half the country could be inoculated by year-end. About 9&nbsp;percent of the population has had one dose, per Reuters, a higher rate than in Japan and Australia. The rate is double in big cities like Mumbai. The acceleration of digital adoption is also supporting longer-term perspectives. The crisis has forced people and businesses online, putting India in position to develop technologically faster than otherwise. A strong capital cushion provides extra comfort. Foreign-exchange reserves of almost $600 billion are roughly double the level in 2013, when the US Federal Reserve curtailed its quantitative easing programme and triggered rupee volatility. Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s policy agenda from incentives for manufacturers to privatisation is also a draw.   The assumption is that emerging market returns will outpace those of developed ones where interest rates are low or negative. Another is that the rich sliver of the population, whose consumption matters most, won&rsquo;t be impacted much, allowing index heavyweights from Reliance Industries&nbsp;to HDFC Bank&nbsp;to thrive even as smaller rivals struggle. But economists are starting to slash their growth forecasts for India, rising inflation may yet prove a spoilsport, and eventually the weakened spending power of the masses who receive little official support will bite.

Reliance and its partner UK's BP Plc on Friday auctioned 7.5 million standard cubic metres per day of incremental gas from the R-series gas field in the KG-D6 block, benchmarking it to a gas marker for the very first time in the country.  The auction was held under the liberalised price discovery rules notified by the government that allowed affiliates of the gas producer to bid and buy natural gas.  Reliance O2C, an affiliate of Reliance, picked up 4.8 mmscmd of gas in Friday''s auction that lasted for seven-and-a-half-hours, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.  State gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd won 0.85 mmscmd of supplies while Shell picked up 0.7 mmscmd. Adani Total Gas Ltd got 0.1 mmscmd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) 0.2 mmscmd and Torrest Gas 0.02 mmscmd.  Other buyers include IRM Energy (0.1 mmscmd), PIL (0.35 mmscmd) and IGS (0.35 mmscmd), they said.  Sources said the gas was bought at a price of USD 0.18 per million British thermal unit discount to JKM i.e. price of JKM (minus) USD 0.18 with tenures ranging from 3 to 5 years.  Reliance did not respond to email sent for comments.  Reliance O2C is the new unit that holds the firm''s refinery and petrochemical assets.  E-bidding process was conducted through an online web-based electronic bidding platform by CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited (CRIS), an independent agency empanelled by Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). CRIS partnered with e-Procurement Technologies Limited (EPTL) and developed e-bidding platform.  The bidding process was carried out as per the guidelines notified by the government in October 2020.  Sources said the bidding process for sale of gas was launched on December 30, 2020 and it witnessed participation from around 15 bidders from city gas distribution sector, steel, power, refineries, petrochemicals, resellers and other industries.  The e-bidding process required bidders to submit their price bids linked to international LNG price benchmark JKM (Japan Korea Marker). The JKM represents price for spot LNG delivered in Asian market and is now being widely used in LNG industry as a marker for in medium/ long term LNG contracts instead of traditional linkage to oil.  This was second time Reliance-BP conducted an e-bidding process which ran on a dynamic forward auction basis for sale of KG-D6 gas. Earlier in November 2019, 5 mmscmd of natural gas was sold at price in range of around 8.6 per cent of Brent crude oil for tenure ranging from 2 to 6 years.  Reliance-BP started production of gas on December 18 last year from the R Cluster ultra-deep-water gas field in block KG D6 off the east coast of India.  The duo developing three deep-water gas projects in block KG-D6 -- R Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ -- which together are expected to meet around 15 per cent of India''s gas demand by 2023.  R Cluster is the first of the three projects to come onstream and is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia.  E-bidding auction rules asked bidders to &amp;quot;quote the variable denoted as ''V'' in USD per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) terms.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;The gas price (in USD/MMBtu (GCV)) shall be = JKM + V,&amp;quot; the bidding notice said.  GCV stands for gross calorific value.  ''V'' can be a positive, zero or negative number and up to two decimal places but it cannot be less than (-)0.30 USD/MMBtu, it said.  This means users will have to quote -0.30 or higher value of ''V''.  If JKM averaged USD 6 per MMBtu, the price will be USD 5.82 per MMBtu.  But Reliance-BP will only get the government notified cap price for gas from deep-sea fields.  Pricing of gas at JKM will be the first time that domestically produced gas is being sold at rates linked to an international gas benchmark, industry sources said.  Also, this will be the first discovery of gas price since the October 2020 decision of the government setting out uniform e-bidding norms for finding the market price.  That Cabinet decision also allowed the sale of gas to ''affiliates'' and so while Reliance-BP affiliate companies couldn''t participate in the November 2019 price discovery, they did in e-bidding on February 5.  The government has given operators the freedom to discover market prices but this rate is subject to a pricing ceiling or cap that the government notifies every six months. The cap for six months to March 31, 2021, is USD 4.06 per mmBtu.  And accordingly, Reliance-BP would get only that amount for the gas.  Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL in November 2019 bought the majority of the initial 5 mmscmd of gas planned to be produced from R-Series in the KG-D6 block by bidding between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent of dated Brent price.  In that bidding, Reliance-BP had asked gas users to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.  A floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price was set, which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for securing gas supplies.  Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.  Reliance got USD 4.205 per MMBtu for gas from D1 and D3 and MA fields during April 2019 and March 2014. It would have got double of that rate if a new formula proposed by the Rangarajan committee was approved but the new BJP government scrapped it and brought a new formula on pricing gas at rates prevalent in export surplus nations such as the US and Russia.  The rates came to USD 5.05 in 2014 and are currently at USD 1.79 per mmBtu.  Reliance-BP is investing USD 5 billion in bringing to production three deepwater gas projects in block KG-D6 R-Cluster, Satellites Cluster, and MJ which together are expected to meet about 15 per cent of India''s gas demand by 2023.  R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12.9 mmscmd while satellites, which are supposed to begin output from the third quarter of the 2021 calendar year, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in the third quarter of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.  Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.  While the MA field stopped producing last year, output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.  Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

Reliance, which operates the world's largest single location oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat with capacity of 68.2 million tonnes a year, got 2 million barrels of consignment Permian basin, the US supplier said in a statement.  Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV), a division of US oil major Occidental, delivered carbon-neutral oil to Reliance, the firm said. &amp;quot;This transaction, which was arranged in conjunction with Macquarie Group's Commodities and Global Markets group (Macquarie), is the energy industry's first major petroleum shipment for which greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the entire crude lifecycle, well head through combustion of end products, have been offset,&amp;quot; it said.  Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Macquarie will offset carbon dioxide equivalent to that associated with the production, delivery and refining of the crude oil and the use of the resulting product through the retirement of carbon offset credits. This will make the oil 'carbon-neutral'. The Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Sea Pearl containing the carbon-neutral oil unloaded the cargo at Jamnagar on January 28.  &amp;quot;This transaction is a first step in the creation of a new market for climate-differentiated crude oil,&amp;quot; the statement said. It is also a bridge to the development of a further differentiated petroleum product, net-zero oil, which Occidental intends to eventually produce through the capture and sequestration of atmospheric CO2 via industrial-scale direct air capture (DAC) facilities and geological sequestration.  Also read: RIL arm to sell entire stake in some upstream assets in Marcellus shale play  Ambani had in July last year unveiled plans to turn Reliance into a net carbon zero company by 2035. This will be done by embracing new technologies to convert its carbon dioxide emissions into useful products and chemicals. OLCV said the oil was produced in the US Permian Basin by Occidental and delivered to Reliance in India.  &amp;quot;Macquarie arranged and structured the bundled offset supply and retirement,&amp;quot; it said. The offsets were sourced from a variety of projects verified under the Verra Verified Carbon Standard meeting eligibility criteria for the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).  &amp;quot;The volume of offsets applied against the cargo are sufficient to cover the expected GHG emissions from the entire crude lifecycle including oil extraction, transport, storage, shipping, refining, subsequent use, and combustion,&amp;quot; it said. This type of transaction, which involves the bundling of high-quality carbon offsets with crude oil, is an immediate executable solution that helps promote investments in longer-term, industrial-scale decarbonisation strategies.  It is also a step in the furtherance of Occidental's net-zero ambitions and commitment to addressing climate change today. Occidental, the first US-based international energy company to announce an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions associated with the use of its products by 2050, has been using carbon-dioxide in its enhanced oil recovery operations in the Permian for over 40 years.  &amp;quot;We are taking important initial steps to work with our customers in hard-to-decarbonize industries to offer carbon-neutral and other low-carbon products that will leverage our expertise in carbon management to lower their total carbon impact and address Scope 3 emissions,&amp;quot; said Richard Jackson, president of OLCV.

EPS before exceptional items stood at Rs 20.5 per share, marking an increase of 38.2 percent QoQ.  The company reported a record quarterly EBITDA for digital services at Rs 8,942 crore.  Here are 5 key highlights of RIL's December quarter scorecard:  Oil to chemicals (O2C) segment shines:&nbsp;The segment's revenue increased 10 percent QoQ to Rs 83,838 crore on account of higher volumes, mainly in transportation fuels, PTA and polyester, supported by improved product realisation across polymers, intermediates and polyester.  Higher product sales and shifting of product placement from exports to the domestic market boosted EBITDA by 10.3 percent QoQ to Rs 9,756 crore for the quarter. EBITDA margin remained flat at 11.6 percent.  Strong rebound in oil and gas segment: The oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment, which includes exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas, witnessed a 21.4 percent QoQ rise in revenue at Rs 431 crore due to higher commodity price realisation and incremental production from R-Cluster.  EBITDA of this segment, which was in the negative in the September quarter, turned positive and stood at Rs 4 crore in the December quarter. EBITDA margin stood at 0.9 percent.  Retail: COVID-related curbs on store operations eased during the quarter, enabling 96 percent of stores to be opened, although only half of them were fully operational.  The company underscored that stores in smaller towns are recovering faster.  The segment's revenue from operations declined 9.7 percent QoQ to Rs 33,018 crore.  Revenue was impacted by the challenging operating conditions due to COVID-19. Besides, the transfer out of the fuel retailing business to the RIL-BP JV, and the decision to convert Reliance Market stores to fulfillment centres to enable city expansion of New Commerce also impacted the revenue of the segment.  EBITDA for the segment zoomed 53.9 percent QoQ to Rs 3,087 crore while EBITDA margin stood at 9.3 percent against 5.5 percent QoQ.  Reliance Retail added over 50,000 new jobs since the beginning of the pandemic and contributes positively to the social and financial well-being of all employees and their families.  Jio Platforms remains on an upward trajectory: Revenue from operations rose 5.3 percent QoQ to Rs 19,475 crore while EBITDA rose 6.4 percent QoQ to Rs 8,483 crore due to growing revenue and operating leverage.  The segment's EBITDA margin for the quarter stood at 43.6 percent which was at 43.1 percent in the September quarter.  Consolidated net profit of the segment grew 15.5 percent QoQ to Rs 3,489 crore.  Jio witnessed a net addition of 52 lakh customers in the December quarter. The total customer base as of December 31, 2020, stood at 41.08 crore.  The average revenue per user (ARPU) during the quarter came at Rs 151 per subscriber per month as against Rs 145 per subscriber per month in the September quarter.  Total data traffic during the quarter grew 4 percent QoQ to 1,586 crore GB whereas total voice traffic during the quarter grew 4.6 percent QoQ to 97,496 crore minutes.  During the quarter, Google invested, post requisite regulatory approvals, an amount of Rs 33,737 crore into Jio Platforms for 7.73 percent stake which took the total investment to Rs 1,52,056 crore by the investors for a stake of 32.88 percent in Jio.  Media segment recovers fully: The revenue of the segment rose 34 percent QoQ to Rs 1,422 crore, recovering fully from the pandemic impact.  Recovery in advertising was sharp and broad-based, resulting in group revenue reviving to pre-pandemic levels.  The segment's EBITDA grew by a whopping 96 percent QoQ and 21 percent YoY to Rs 324 crore while EBITDA margins rose to nearly 23 percent as all three verticals - entertainment, TV and digital news.  Subscription revenue was up 6 percent QoQ and 2 percent YoY. Domestic subscription revenue growth remained strong due to improved tie-ups in TV and digital, offsetting stress in international.  Commenting on the results, Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited said: &amp;quot;We have delivered strong operational results during the quarter with a robust revival in O2C and retail segments, and steady growth in our digital services business.

On the operating front, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 6.4 percent QoQ to Rs 8,483 crore with margin expanding&nbsp;50 bps QoQ to 43.6 percent due to growing revenue and operating leverage.  &amp;quot;India is today among the leaders driving the Digital Revolution in the world. In order to maintain this lead, Jio will continue to accelerate the rollout of its digital platforms and indigenously developed next generation 5G stack and make it affordable and available everywhere. Jio's 5G service will be a testimony to the vision of AtmaNirbhar Bharat,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  Jio Platforms has achieved a milestone this quarter with annualised operating revenue run-rate of $10 billion with strong revenue and EBITDA growth, said the company in its BSE filing.  Reliance Retail  Reliance Retail delivered a healthy performance with record profit delivery in an operating environment that continued to remain challenging with sporadic COVID related restrictions and local issues, the company said in its BSE filing.  Retail's EBITDA surged 53.9 percent sequentially to a record Rs 3,087 crore with margin expansion of 380 bps QoQ at 9.3 percent for the quarter ended December 2020, whereas revenue from operations declined 9.7 percent QoQ to Rs 33,018 crore for the quarter and value of sales and services for Q3FY21 decreased by 8 percent QoQ to Rs 37,845 crore.  &amp;quot;The underlying operating margin (excluding the impact of the investment income) stood at 7 percent, coming in ahead of last quarter and same time last year. This was led by near doubling of Fashion and Lifestyle earnings, continued benefits from cost management initiatives and a boost from higher investment income of Rs 775 crore,&amp;quot; said Reliance.  With the Indian economy poised for a rapid recovery in 2021 after overcoming the COVID-19&nbsp;constraints, Reliance Retail is confident of maintaining its industry leading and market beating&nbsp;performance.  In November, Reliance Retail Ventures, the subsidiary of RIL, completed fund-raising of Rs 47,265 crore by selling a 10.09 percent stake in the company.  Oil to Chemicals  Reliance's oil to chemicals (O2C) business, which has formally reorganised reporting segments to reflect new strategy and management matrix, clocked 10 percent sequential growth in revenue at Rs 83,838 crore for the quarter ended December 2020 on higher volumes mainly in transportation fuels, PTA and polyester supported by improved product realization across polymers, intermediates and polyester.  At operating level, the segment registered a 10.3 percent QoQ growth in EBITDA at Rs 9,756 crore on higher product sales and shifting of product placement from exports to domestic market, with flat margin at 11.6 percent compared to previous quarter.  Its EBIT grew by 13.3 percent to Rs 7,647&nbsp;crore with margin expansion of 20 bps at&nbsp;9.1&nbsp;percent compared to previous quarter.  On O2C basis, the company said total throughput has increased from 16.8 MMT to 18.2 MMT on QoQ basis due to improved product demand in Q3 and scheduled shutdown taken in Q2.  &amp;quot;The reorganised structure in O2C business will facilitate holistic and agile decision making and enable us to pursue attractive new opportunities for growth, with strategic partnerships with the best and the biggest in this business globally. The O2C platform will increasingly move further downstream and become closer to customers,&amp;quot; billionaire Mukesh Ambani.  Oil and Gas (Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production)  Oil and gas (exploration &amp;amp;amp; production) business reported a 21.4 percent sequential growth in revenue at Rs 431 crore in Q3FY21 due to higher commodity price realisation and incremental production from R-Cluster.  In December, Reliance Industries and BP started production from the R Cluster, ultra-deep-water gas field in block KG D6 off the east coast of India. Both are developing three deepwater gas projects in block KG D6&ndash; R Cluster, Satellites Cluster and MJ&ndash;which together are expected to meet around 15 percent of India's gas demand by 2023.  In fact, at the operating level,&nbsp;the oil &amp;amp;amp; gas segment&nbsp;turned profitable with EBITDA at Rs 4 crore (against loss of Rs 194 crore) and margin at 0.9 percent (against -54.6 percent) for the quarter ended December 2020.  Reliance said outstanding debt as on December 2020 was Rs 2,57,413 crore and cash &amp;amp;amp; cash equivalents were at Rs 2,20,524 crore. &amp;quot;Balance capital commitment receivables (on account of Rights issue) are in excess of quarterend net debt levels.&amp;quot;  RIL retained its domestic credit ratings of 'AAA/Stable' from CRISIL and 'AAA/Stable' from India Ratings, and an investment grade rating for its international debt from Moody&rsquo;s as 'Baa2' and 'BBB+' from S&amp;amp;amp;P.  Reliance shares hit a record high of Rs 2,368 in September and have since corrected 13 percent. During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, it was down 11 percent but rallied 32 percent in the calendar year.

Following these developments, Reliance has gone nationalistic in a big way. Jio is the only telecom company which has not used Chinese equipments and Airtel and Voda-Idea have used majority Chinese equipment's.  Jio has built India's own indigenous 5G technology, a major step in the direction of Prime Ministers &amp;quot;AtmaNirbhar Bharat&amp;quot; agenda.

The protests have become ammunition in a political war, and the assets and reputation of large corporate organisations such as Reliance Industries are collateral damage.  Our democracy gives everyone the right to protest, whether or not we agree with their views. But this has to be within the laws of the land. The only way that the farmer movement can remain focused and gain traction is by following the law. Farmers are fast losing friends by choking up the highways leading to the National Capital Region inconveniencing the general population, let alone the vandalism in Punjab.  It is also unfortunate that farmers have dragged a company that has nothing to do with the farm sector into the protests. Large companies, irrespective of their contribution to the country&rsquo;s growth, development, and employment, seem fair game to anyone who wishes to fling mud at the government. Moreover, how can the farmers and their leaders justify the vandalism unleashed on RIL and its subsidiaries in Punjab and Haryana by way of damaging telecom towers?  In this instance, RIL has nothing to do with farms and contract farming, as it has said in a petition. Through its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL), in a petition filed at the&nbsp;Punjab and Haryana High Court on January 4,&nbsp;RIL said it has nothing whatsoever to do with the three farm laws and in no way benefits from them. As such, the sole nefarious purpose of linking the name of Reliance to these laws is to harm its businesses and damage its reputation.  RIL has further explained in the petition that it has not done any &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; or &ldquo;contract&rdquo;&nbsp;farming&nbsp;in the past, and has no plans&nbsp;to enter this business. &ldquo;Neither Reliance nor any of our subsidiaries have purchased any agricultural land,&nbsp;directly or indirectly, in Punjab/Haryana or anywhere else in India, for &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; or &ldquo;contract&rdquo; farming&rdquo; it said in a statement.  The company also said it has never entered into the long-term procurement contracts to gain an unfair advantage over farmers or sought that its suppliers buy from farmers at less than remunerative prices, nor will it ever do so.  The company has effectively staked its corporate reputation by making this statement to the courts and stock exchanges. A globally respected brand can ill afford to risk dilution, let alone the upkeep of its promise and what it has committed in the courts and to the regulator.  If farmers and their leaders are serious about the cause, they should focus their arguments against the government and take up the fight in the judiciary. Launching an unprovoked attack on corporate entities and individuals is nothing but pure theatrics.  Even if these are symbolic, they will only weaken the actual cause especially if the action brings economic loss, social unrest, and inconveniences the common man. It will prove detrimental to achieving the ultimate objective. In this case, the repeal of the three farm acts.  Vandalism can never be a means to a just end. More than 140 lakh RJio subscribers in Punjab and more than 40 lakh subscribers in Haryana, were incapacitated by the towers' attack. Who benefitted? Only the competitors of Reliance and a few vested interests.  Did it serve the purpose for which the farmers have been agitating for more than 40 days in the severe cold and rain? Certainly not. On the contrary, it will be seen as a loss of public property, which has nothing to do with three farms acts.  Allegations, till proven with facts and evidence in the courts, have no value. So, if farmer leaders are preaching that a few corporate actors are the architects behind the three farm acts, let them prove it in the courts and let the law take its course.  They should focus their attention and energy on the government if they wish to achieve what they have set out to do. If they can convince the government or courts, that the three farm acts are faulty, de facto, corporates become inconsequential.​  Disclosure:&nbsp;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd."

The brokerage firm on December 22 announced the Motilal Oswal 25th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2020.  For the last 25 years, the firm has been releasing a wealth creation study every year. Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman of Motilal Oswal Group, commissions&nbsp;the study every year.  In this year's study, the brokerage firm attempted to shortlist 25 stocks likely to deliver handsome returns over the next 25 years.  As per the brokerage firm, it made a list of 150 mid-cap companies i.e. companies that are ranked 101 to 250 by current market cap.  It preferred consumer-facing, secular business models and eliminated cyclical businesses like auto ancillaries, capital goods, chemicals, oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and realty which reduced the list of companies from 150 to 114.  To ensure the chosen firms are very profitable, the brokerage firm said it&nbsp;picked companies with last 5-year average RoE greater than 15 percent. This reduced the list from 114 to 63.  Next, it judged the business potential and management potential of the companies, and selected only those which qualified on both counts. This reduced the list from 63 to 28.  After that, the brokerage firm flagged off market leaders from the 28 companies to arrive at a list of 13 companies. Apart from these 13 companies, the brokerage chose 5 such companies from the list of 28 that are beneficiaries of value migration. In situations of value migration, all companies benefit irrespective of market leadership.  Now, the total shortlisted stocks were 18.  The brokerage firm said it chose only large-caps for financials and picked 6 leader names for the portfolio, now taking the total to 24.  At last, it opted for a pure digital play, even if it didn&rsquo;t meet some of the above filters, taking the total to 25.  &amp;quot;We believe in the very long run, valuations matter less.

The conversation on Day 1 of the two-day Facebook-hosted event revolved around opportunities in India, the way digital can accelerate economic progress, and how small businesses will be a key part of the global recovery going forward.  Read the full transcript of the conversation between Mukesh Ambani and Mark Zuckerberg below:&nbsp;  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I am sorry that we can't do this together in person, but we're excited to host the first-ever Facebook Fuel event in India. India is a very special and important country for us. Millions of people here use our products every day to stay in touch with friends and family. Whether it's a WhatsApp message, or a Facebook post, or photos on Instagram. And millions of small businesses across the country use WhatsApp business and Messenger to reach customers, manage orders, and grow their businesses. And in fact, we actually test some of our new features here first, before rolling them out globally. And speaking of tests, we just announced that we are hosting India&rsquo;s tour of Australia on demand on Facebook Watch. I am not exactly a sports guy myself, but I understand that that's quite a big deal here. And what I do know is that India is home to a lot of incredibly talented people. Now we see that in the folks that we recruit in our offices, both in India and at our headquarters, back in California. But this is more than just about Facebook because what happens in India here is important for the whole world as well. Prime Minister Modi's Digital India Vision, has opened up opportunities for the industry to partner with the government to accelerate growth and development through technology. And India is building local capabilities and tech capacity, to power innovative new business models and provide Indian citizens access to digital and financial inclusion. So, decisions that are made here, shape the global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people. And a lot of Indian organizations are leading the way, and using technology to build safer communities and more inclusive financial systems. Whether it's in social commerce, or education or financial services, there is a lot of innovation that happens here, and we are proud to partner with some of the teams that are working on these important challenges. There's a very entrepreneurial culture here, that's quite remarkable. It's a great example of how access to better tools can unlock more opportunity for people, and we see that not just in the tech start-up scene, but millions and millions of small businesses that recognize the value that all these tools can provide. So, at Facebook, we like to say that we are in the business of serving small businesses. And nowhere is this more true than in India. This is especially important because small businesses here will be a key part of the global recovery going forward. And we are focused on making sure we build the best tools for them. So, this is part of a much broader conversation about how we can all make sure that tech delivers for everyone. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to partner with Jio, which has played such a key role in giving hundreds of millions of Indians access to the benefits of the internet, everything that it can provide, and fostering this entrepreneurial culture. And with that, I am really glad to welcome Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, to talk about where things stand in terms of the country's digital transformation, and what we should expect in the years ahead. Mukesh, thank you very much for being here and let's get started.  Mukesh Ambani: Mark, first of all, congratulations to you and your team for organizing this Facebook Fuel for India event. I am sure this event will provide a lot of fuel of ideas to fire India&rsquo;s growth engine as you just described. The most powerful idea that can propel India&rsquo;s growth is that young people can create great enterprises and new businesses. And all the young Indian people see an inspiring young icon in Mark Zuckerberg. They are motivated when they see how in just 14 years, Facebook has become the face of a digitally connected India. So, let me begin by conveying my best wishes to the success of your dreams for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, I appreciate that. You know, so maybe today we should start with a topic that I know is top of mind for a lot of us, that is COVID-19 and the impact that it has had on all of our lives and communities. So, I am curious from your perspective, how is India doing right now? And when do you expect things are going to return to normal? And I know that Reliance has taken a number of big steps to help the community and help the country, and it's been a big year for you. So I am curious to hear, how did your company adapt to help move forward in the midst of this pandemic?  Mukesh Ambani: The sheer magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic, like everybody else in the world, did startle all of us in India. But then I think it is not in India&rsquo;s DNA to be deterred by a crisis. I firmly believe that a crisis is too precious to be wasted. Every crisis presents an opportunity for new growth, and India has faced the COVID crisis with enormous resilience and resolve. Prime Minister Modi has led India from the front, and while we are not as rich a country as some of our western counterparts, being fiscally prudent, he has taken steps to take care of our vulnerable. We have given free food for right up to December of this year, to over 800 million Indians. 200 million citizens in India are getting direct cash transfer of Rs. 1500 in their bank account - that is the digitally connected India. And now we are ready and pretty much at par with the world, to roll out one of the largest vaccine programs in the first half of 2021, under Prime Minister's leadership. We at Reliance and Reliance Foundation, have also taken steps. As you know, Reliance has over 350,000 employees across the length and breadth of India and we have taken steps to protect over 2 million in our family and the community around them. In Mumbai, we have built a hospital just dedicated to COVID-19. We have Life Sciences as part of our business, so we have tested up early on - we have really ramped up testing, and we believe that testing helped in tracing and isolation, and at least reduced fatalities in our communities to a very low level. We have produced PPEs. We are in the textile business in Reliance, and India did not have&hellip;we used to import all our protective gear from the external world. In a matter of months, we at Reliance, produced a hundred thousand PPE's, and we are now exporters from India and this happened during the COVID time. And most importantly in the early days, when we were little stuck, we at the Reliance Foundation, distributed 55 million, one of the largest meal distribution programs for the vulnerable, in all the states and villages. So, we have played our part. And as far as Jio is concerned, we had our own dedicated team. And I could tell you that, we had never imagined that we would all work from home and the network traffic grew multiple percentage and none of us stepped out. But we could maintain 99% availability, so that Indians could work from home, shop from home, study from home, and remain connected to the rest of the world. You know, Mark, sometimes I wonder that if the pandemic had struck India just four or five years earlier, we would not have been in as good a shape as what we are today, with all the connectivity we have. The credit for that must go to our Prime Minister's Digital India vision, where he motivated the entire industry to roll out broadband in the first five years of his first term. And during the pandemic, India has attracted the largest foreign direct investment in its history. Mark, we have our own example of how Jio and Facebook concluded our partnership right in the middle of lockdown. And let me tell you with utmost sincerity, that we at Reliance and Jio, immensely value our partnership with Facebook. Thank you for your faith in Jio. Thank you, Mark, for your faith in India. I have no hesitation in going on record, that it is your investment that set the ball rolling. Not only for Jio but for the Indian FDI which has been the largest-ever in its history. And our partnership between Jio and Facebook will actually demonstrate that it is great for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses. And I believe Mark, that our actions will speak louder than our words in the coming months and years.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you. So, you know, one of the big opportunities that I see with this Facebook and Jio partnership is the role that we can play together in supporting the millions of small businesses in India, especially now with the impact that COVID is having, in accelerating the move of businesses from physical storefronts to digital ones in this digital future. So, I am curious what role do you see technology playing in this post-COVID world, especially as it relates to all of these small businesses. I know you share a passion with me that it is just critical that we serve them.  Mukesh Ambani: Absolutely, Mark. And let me point out a very unique feature about our partnership. Perhaps not many people have understood this. Because, before this partnership I believe that each one of us was mainly a communication platform. Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses. And I firmly believe that technology, all the digitisation steps that India has taken will democratise wealth and value creation for individuals and small businesses. And let me explain this very simply. WhatsApp has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio Mart, which is our retail service, has the aspiration of serving tens of millions of small shopkeepers in India, who are the bedrock of employment. So what does this mean? This means Jio brings digital connectivity, WhatsApp now with WhatsApp Pay brings digital interactivity, and the ability to move to close transactions and create value and Jio Mart brings the unmatched online and offline retail opportunity, that gives our small shops which exist in villages and small towns in India, a chance to digitize and be at par with anybody else in the world. To my mind, more wealth creation means more employment and more business. And together with our platforms and the tools that we will provide to small businesses and to individual consumers, I believe will drive India to a 5 trillion economy and will make a much more equal India, with more equal wealth growth at the bottom of the pyramid. You know, Mark, I firmly believe that in the next two decades, India will grow to be among the top three economies in the world. But more importantly, it will become a premier digital society. It will be a modern society with young people driving it, with young businesses driving it. And our per capita income will go from eighteen hundred - two thousand dollars per capita, to five thousand dollars per capita. Our mid-income or the middle class in India which is about 50% of its total number of households, will grow to three to four percent per year. And I think that Facebook, Jio, and a lot of other companies and entrepreneurs in the world, have a golden opportunity to be in India, to be part of this economic and social transformation, that we are witnessing and that will accelerate in the coming decades.  Mark Zuckerberg: I completely agree, and your company has already done so much to help fuel this. Reliance brought about the 4G revolution in India, and I know that 5G now is another big focus for you. But what your company has done here I think, has been truly remarkable in helping to bring hundreds of millions of people onto the internet and bringing opportunity. And I&rsquo;m curious, as you look ahead to the future in India, what other technologies or developments are you excited about now? And where do you see the country in the next five to ten years?  Mukesh Ambani: Well, as I mentioned to you Mark, I really see India accelerating as a premier digital society. I see us integrating both 5G&hellip;and just yesterday, our Prime Minister has said that, he wants every village and every gram panchayat&hellip;India has 680,000 villages, and we have a population of 1.3 billion people, and he wants everybody to be empowered on the information highway with high speed fix broadband, and which is happening. We also think that compute and very low latency compute is real. I think that there is a great opportunity for really bringing education and health care. With the second-generation reforms that were done in the last six months, we have unique opportunities and as Jio we are connecting all the 1.9 million schools in India and the 58 000 colleges. At any point in time, we will have in the coming decades, about 200 million children or young adults, between the age of 3 and 18 in our education system. I think that in a span of 10 years, we can set for ourselves an objective really to reskill India and the talent that you talked about, can improve 10x. Today, you're just seeing the creamy layer, but that's what technology can do to really make a better India and a better world. The same thing we can do in health and all the emerging technology and integrations, where we can make sure that we deliver services, and we deliver good proactive health. We've learned that and I think we're going to use technology. We are working very closely with all the authorities to make sure that we provide the technology tools and backbone for even vaccination in the coming quarters using technology. So, I think health, education&hellip;.we've already&hellip; and I think that what India has done is in a sense, we have democratized value creation with the drive of our Prime Minister. And you can see it in payments, you will see it in terms of making sure that technology is easily available and we made it affordable, so that millions of millions of people, even at this lower per capita basis can use this in a large market. And with that finally, I really see the enterprise and the enthusiasm of young Indians, their aspirations, and their confidence that is really driving India. And that is why I think that the next two decades are going to be historic in terms of the social and economic transformation.  Mark Zuckerberg: That makes sense. You, of course, already talked about commerce and driving small businesses and entrepreneurship. It always blows me away that India has more than 60 million small businesses, and millions of people around the country rely on them for jobs and that's a big part of what I hope that our partnership can serve here. We support more than 50 million WhatsApp business app users globally every month already. And more than 15 million of these are in India. So you know with communities around the world now in lockdown there are a lot of these entrepreneurs who need digital tools that they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses. And now this is just something that I think that our partnership can really help with. And of course, beyond the impact on small businesses.I just think that this year has reminded us of how essential technology can be as a tool for people, to just connect with each other. Whether it's using the networks that your companies have established, or the tools that we've built to be able to have that human connection, and find important information. And as you said, I can't imagine going through the pandemic 10 years ago, two decades, when the internet was still nascent. It should have been a completely different experience. And technology, of course, is allowing us to make sure we can get accurate information out to people that has implications in health, like you're talking about, in education and helping serve people better. And I think it shows a lot of the promise for what's ahead and I think we've certainly fared better now, than we would have if the pandemic had hit us before.  Mukesh Ambani: I couldn't agree more, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: You know, going back to Reliance, one of the great business stories in history, your father founded Reliance Industries and he has this incredible legacy here in India. And now I&rsquo;ve read that, he once held up a postcard in his office and said, if every Indian could speak with each other at the cost of this postcard, where will India be? And now your father clearly had a vision for where things were heading in the country, and because today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard, and that's what we've tried to do with messaging&hellip;and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI system, which I think is just great. It's a tremendous public good that the government has put out there. But I am curious, before we get into UPI and more on that, what's the most important thing that you learned from your father and his legacy, that has helped you build these amazing businesses and get to where they are today?  Mukesh Ambani: So Mark, thank you for those kind words on my father. Just so that when he motivated us in 2000, in terms of saying, can you make voice at the cost of a postcard? In 2020, we're very proud that Jio has pioneered free voice. So, all the 400 million people are a tribute to his vision. They are on our network and have a free voice. And as you said, my father was a son of a school teacher. He came to Mumbai with just a thousand rupees in 1960 and established Reliance with a belief that I will invest in businesses of the future, and I will invest in talent. And, for all the young people at Reliance and across India, I repeat my learnings in terms of building Reliance, three basic tenets really. One is, for entrepreneurs, it's important to have courage and self-belief. There can be no better person to demonstrate that in the last couple of decades than you, Mark. So you know, all of us believe that we have to believe in ourselves. And all of us know as entrepreneurs that we don't succeed at the first attempt, and self-belief comes to you when you fail. And self-belief increases your confidence when you succeed. So, courage and self-belief is something that I always tell entrepreneurs, remember that it's important. The second piece that he started and he's instilled into all of us is that, while you succeed, it's important to always have empathy and creativity in everything that you do. And by empathy, I mean, put yourself in the other's shoe, and make sure that how you make them feel is how you would want to feel. At Reliance, we do that at many levels now - we care for our employees, our investors, society, environment, and above all national interests of India. You know, within creativity&hellip;.and I always give this example in terms of saying that, when Reliance needed to grow, capital markets were not there. It was the 1980s, and my father came up by saying, I will actually share shares of Reliance, which was never done in the private sector. In the 80s, the first AGM of Reliance was in a football ground, and we had 60,000 shareholders. You and I both do annual general meetings. And his AGM in the 1980s for Reliance was in a football ground and he said, my purpose is really to win investor&rsquo;s confidence. Since then, creativity and empathy are critical as you go along. And the final thing that I have learned from my father, is really the importance of relationship, trust, and loyalty. The whole of Reliance right now, with hundreds of thousands of people, is one big family. We're not related by birth, but we are really woven together by passion, purpose, and conviction. We have faith in one another. We are loyal to one another, to this large Reliance family. For us, it's always one for all, and all for one. And I hope that a lot of people around the world can relate to this. That's what we believe at Reliance and for all of us at Reliance, he will still be the founder, if we follow his vision in terms of investing in businesses of the future. Mark, now that brings me to questions for you. Mark, what made you believe in India and the Jio story? As I said, you started this FDI avalanche in India, and the world recognized when Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, in the middle of lockdown said, I am going to bet on India and I&rsquo;m going to make even in this uncertain times, one of the largest foreign direct investments in India. What do you think of the digital network that you are clearly&hellip;.I call you the architect of the digital network of the world. While I have built some connectivity and broadband connectivity in India, you've done that for the world. Please share with us your experience as the digital architect of the world, how your global Facebook has helped people in this crisis, and your perspective of the crisis, and where you see the world today, and where it is going after you just explain to us what you&rsquo;ve done in India?  Mark Zuckerberg: Your words are incredibly generous. And we started this to help give people a tool to stay connected with their friends, and then expand to friends and family and communities, and a lot of this just ends up being a universal human phenomenon. No matter what country you're in, you know everyone cares about their friends and family, and their communities, and wants to stay connected. And what we've seen is that, India is actually home to the largest communities in the world, across Facebook and WhatsApp and getting there on Instagram, as well. So, we see the vitality and the entrepreneurship, and the creativity of businesses, and how much people want to connect, and you see a tremendous number of people coming online, a lot of that&hellip;thanks to your investments, and the work that you've done to enable hundreds of millions of people to come online here. And I just see a very promising future in India. We talked briefly about how there's a big trend of financial inclusion ahead, and how the ease of payments is going to be such a big deal for commerce, and giving people self-reliance and control of their own destiny, and a lot of that. We just launched WhatsApp payments in India last month - now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp, as easily as sending a message. That was possible because of the UPI system that has been built in India. Unified Payments Interface, makes it easy for anyone to instantly accept payments across different apps. I think we're working with 140 banks or it's supported by 140 banks. India is the first country in the world to do anything like this. So, we're grateful to be able to support this kind of innovation and to help to work, to create more prosperity, and help achieve a more Digital India. And frankly, I think that a lot of other places around the world are going to be better off when they follow some of this lead that India has set, in creating public goods like this. So there's really a tremendous amount to be inspired by, with what is going on in India now. And we're just grateful to be able to serve our community here, and help people stay connected with the people they care about but also, create economic opportunity as well.  Mukesh Ambani: Thanks Mark, as you said, we are looking forward to your involvement and innovation in India, creating benefit for hundreds of millions of people and then taking this innovation to the rest of the world. I hope that the rest of the world learns from Indian policy, and what Facebook is able to achieve in India. And we as Indians will be very proud, if Facebook says we did it first in India, and then took it to 100 countries. And I look forward to working with you on that. Mark, all of us would love to know your views on how the world is changing, and what you and Facebook are thinking about it, and what you see the future as. Just give us your perspective, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: I think that there are a number of very important trends, but maybe I'll just talk about two. So, one is that, I think technology is giving individuals&rsquo; power and opportunities that were previously only held by large organizations. So, we've spent a lot of time today talking about small businesses, but one of the things that I think is so powerful about the internet is it makes it so that individual entrepreneurs and small businesses can now have access to the same kind of tools for reaching new customers and doing sophisticated analytics and communication that previously only bigger companies would have been able to build up the capacity to do that. And individuals can now share their ideas online, and get access to information in ways that previously only wealthier people or larger organizations would have had the capacity to share their ideas, or get access to information at that kind of scale. And overall, I think that just makes people's lives better. It's incredibly empowering and it's incredibly democratizing. India being the world's largest democracy, I think it really makes sense to lead there, because just empowering individuals, which I know is something that you believe deeply in as well, is just going to be a huge part of what will hopefully create a lot of prosperity, as you mentioned in the decades ahead. The other thing that I&rsquo;m excited about is more of a technological vision for the future. There are a lot of interesting technologies, but one trend that I focus a lot on is that as people we're always looking to connect with other people and share our experiences in the richest way that we can. So, if you look back to the beginning of the internet, most of the internet was text. We would text each other, chat, share our experiences but then connections got better. And then we got to photos being the primary way that we shared. And you know the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, a lot of sharing is through photos and we're now on the next step with 4G and coming 5G networks - video is really becoming the primary way that people share. Anyone can largely capture something on their phones and can share it or stream it, and increasingly, people are able to consume that. And video is just a lot richer of a medium than photos even can be. When my daughters took her first steps, I wanted to capture a video of that and share it, not just a photo. But I don't think video is the end of the line. So, a lot of what I am focused on is helping to create virtual reality and augmented reality. So that way we can share not only a video of an experience, but you can use virtual reality to go into an experience and feel like you're right there. You can have holograms of digital objects that can kind of be as realistic as the physical objects that are there. Maybe you know, in five or ten years, when we're having this conversation, just a hologram version of me will be sitting on the couch next to you, instead of having to do this over a screen. And it'll feel a lot more realistic. So, I just think that's going to be incredibly powerful. And the power of virtual and augmented reality is they deliver the sense of a presence. You feel like you're right there with another person, which really will be the ultimate in human connection, and it will give people the opportunity to work and to connect, no matter where they want to be. So that's something that we're very focused on and invested in. And I&rsquo;m just very excited for the future. And on that note, let me just wrap up and just say again how grateful I am for everything that you and your companies do, and for the partnership. I do think that in so many ways, not just Jio and the technology platforms, but the other businesses that you've built, you've had such a positive impact on improving the quality of lives for hundreds of millions of Indians. A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people. So, I just have a deep admiration for that. And I am really looking forward to working together over the coming years and decades to make sure we can serve the people in India as well as possible. And hopefully, a lot of those advances will be expanded outside of India as well, to help people around the world. But I am incredibly grateful for your partnership on this. Thank you for joining me for this inaugural Facebook Fuel event today.  Mukesh Ambani: Thank you very much, Mark. And thank you for sharing your awesome vision of the future. You started this with saying that on Facebook, you would see the India - Australia cricket match, I look forward to a day when Facebook will take me with everything that you explained on virtual reality, where I will be sitting in Mumbai and be in a stadium in Australia. And I&rsquo;m sure that day, with your digital architecture and leadership, is not far away. Thank you so very much for having me.

The fashion and lifestyle arm of Reliance said its 'Indie range' (Indie by AJIO) is sourced from over 50 GI crafts clusters from across Indian states - including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.  With this geographical indication tag, natural produce, handicrafts, or manufactured goods are identified native to a territory, region, or locality for their unique characteristics.  &amp;quot;The diversity of sourcing from across the length and breadth of India has resulted not only in the creation of a stunning portfolio that is every handcraft connoisseur&rsquo;s dream, but also in the direct employment for over 30,000 skilled artisans across the country.

Here's what Ambani said during the virtual address:  Honourable Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupaniji, my fellow members of the Board, faculty, teachers, staff, students, parents, and my dear friends,  A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. I wish all of you good health and safety. I hope that you are all taking necessary precautions to keep yourself and your dear ones safe and protected.  India has entered a crucial phase in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot afford to let our guards down at this juncture.  We are extremely privileged to have the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Sh Narendrabhai Modi, as the chief guest for today&rsquo;s event. His passionate and dynamic leadership has made the world sit up and take notice of the emergence of a New India.  His confidence and conviction have inspired and galvanised the entire nation.  I am sure that the bold reforms introduced under his leadership will pave the way for India&rsquo;s swift recovery and rapid economic progress in the years to come.  Friends, all of us know that PDPU itself is a product of Honourable Prime Minister Narendrabhai's &amp;quot;Atmanirbhar&amp;quot; vision.  It is a vision he cherished even when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat...to make India self-reliant in the areas of Energy, Energy Education, Research and Innovation.  PDPU is only fourteen years old. Yet, it already ranks among the Top-25 in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements.  In terms of diversity, we attract international students from across the world. We have 284 international students from 39 countries.  And from a total of 132 students in the first convocation in 2009, we have 2,608 students, including 46 PhDs, graduating today.  From National Rankings, I am sure PDPU will soon earn a place in global rankings.  My dear teachers, PDPU has world-class physical infrastructure. But what gives me far greater joy is that PDPU has world-class faculty as well. Your dedication and commitment to excellence has been exemplary.  In the best practice of India's Guru Parampara, you have always gone beyond the call of duty. You have been friends, guides and mentors to your students. Let's take a moment to appreciate the leadership, faculty and all the staff of PDPU.  Friends, today I have a special reason to applaud PDPU. The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on the academic lives and careers of students across the world.  Precious hours of academic engagement, debate and research have been lost in lockdowns. Yet, our very own PDPU did exceptionally well even in these challenging times.  The flame of teaching and learning at PDPU shone brightest even during the darkest days of the pandemic. Our faculty continued to present award-winning research papers in national and international conferences. Our students continued to enjoy co-curricular and extra-curricular activities held digitally.  These facts make me proud of our university. But my heart swelled with greater pride when I learnt that PDPU also contributed to the nation's fight against COVID-19. Our teachers and students designed several medical equipment, including an ICU ventilator.  I salute the leadership of PDPU for combining Jnana with Seva. This combination is the greatest badge of honour for any educational institution.  Dear members of the PDPU Community, our accomplishments so far have been a source of joy.  However, we have to prepare ourselves to scale still higher summits of success.  The future of energy is being shaped by unprecedented changes. And these changes are impacting the future of humanity &mdash; indeed, the very future of our planet.  The most important question we face is this:  Can we produce the growing amounts of energy we need to sustain our economies without harming the environment?...Without failing to fulfil our climate change obligations? We must be prepared to answer this question with a CONFIDENT &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;!  By the middle of this century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today. In the next two decades, India&rsquo;s own per-capita energy needs will be more than twice as much as today.  Therefore, India is required to simultaneously pursue two goals: To become an economic superpower. To become a green and clean energy superpower.  To achieve these twin goals, we need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies. We need breakthroughs in new energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen. We also need great innovations in energy storage, saving and utilisation.  As a person from the energy business, I can assure the students and faculty of PDPU that you are entering an exciting future.  What makes it even more exciting is the synergy between the Energy Revolution and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. If we master this synergy, we will surely be able to make India one of the most prosperous nations in the world. An India that guarantees prosperity and wellbeing for all 1.3 billion Indians.  Honourable Chief Minister Shri Rupani ji, Gujarat is a trailblazer state. It has always shown the pioneer spirit. Today the entire world acknowledges that NEW GUJARAT has paved the path for NEW INDIA. The visionary leadership of Shri Narendra Modi ji that Gujarat received is now available to the nation.  I must compliment you and your team for making Vibrant Gujarat even more vibrant under the guidance of Shri Modi ji and Shri Amit Shah ji.  Here is our solemn assurance to you today. PDPU will continue to make its unique contribution to enhancing the reputation of Gujarat and India in energy education and research.  My dear Young Graduates, I see in you, 2,608 future builders of a strong, proud and vibrant India. My heartiest congratulations to you on your success. May all your dreams come true as you embark on a new journey in your life.  However, always remember an important life lesson. Learning is a constant and never-ending process of exploration, discovery and adventure. A true student never stops the pursuit of knowledge.  Therefore, here is my message to you, and I am only repeating Mahatma Gandhi's wise words: &amp;quot;Learn for life, Learn through life, and Learn throughout life&amp;quot;.  I have another message for you. When you step out of this beautiful campus, you will no doubt carry wonderful memories with you.  But perhaps you will also carry some concern, some uncertainty, some anxiety about the future.  This is only natural. The COVID situation will likely accentuate your thoughts and feelings.  Therefore, I would like to tell you with great emphasis today...venture out with supreme hope and confidence. The future is very bright for India, for you, and for all Indians.  This, our ancient nation, has faced many adversities in the past. And has emerged stronger each time. This is because resilience is in the very DNA of Indian people, Indian culture.  In the post-COVID era, I clearly foresee explosive and exponential growth in the Indian economy. Within a couple of decades, India will be among the top three economies in the world.  Growth will create unprecedented opportunities and possibilities for young and talented people like you. Indeed, most of these opportunities will be created by young entrepreneurs themselves. I see many amongst you as the creators of successful startups.  The world is waiting for you. Step out and take the plunge. Fail, if necessary, but in pursuit of your dreams. With passion, purpose and persistent effort, your dreams will indeed come true.  We, at PDPU, take pride in now calling you our alumni &ndash; our ambassadors. Make all of us at PDPU proud. Make your parents proud. Make India proud.  Once again, my hearty congratulations to the Class of 2019 and 2020. Good luck and God bless.  Thank you.

Reliance Retail-Future Group deal: RIL unit adds Future Group&rsquo;s retail business to shopping cart for Rs 24,713 crore.&nbsp;  The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into Future Enterprises Ltd (FEL).  The announcement comes as a setback to Amazon.com which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.  Amazon had moved the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October and won an interim stay on the deal. The SIAC passed the interim order asking Future Group to hold its plans of selling its retail business to RIL on October 25.&nbsp;  Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into FRL after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owned a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.  Along with this, Amazon even wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI seeking a stay on the deal.  Later, Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) on November 7 moved the Delhi High Court against Amazon.com for interfering in its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL) by misusing the arbitration order passed by SIAC.

The company showed a strong rebound across all businesses in the September 2020 quarter, on the back of a sharp recovery in domestic demand.  &amp;quot;We delivered strong overall operational and financial performance compared to the previous quarter with recovery in petrochemicals and retail segment and sustained growth in the digital services business,&amp;quot; said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries.  In the digital services segment, the company showed the continuation of sustained growth to record high operational as well as financial numbers.  &amp;quot;Domestic demand has sharply recovered across our O2C business and is now near the pre-COVID level for most products.

Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.  &amp;quot;India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,&amp;quot; he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions. This, he said, was &amp;quot;very, very compelling&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Why is India important, because it is India,&amp;quot; he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50 percent coal to 40 percent, while gas and renewables will grow. Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.  As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports.  RIL holds 51 percent in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49 percent. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49 percent stake. This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought a 30 percent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India. RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.  &amp;quot;Our production with Reliance will account for 15 percent of India gas production,&amp;quot; he said. Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.  GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that. When Goods and Services Tax (GST), which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products &ndash; petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.  This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel. He said BP has a &amp;quot;deep, trusting relationship&amp;quot; with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.  On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.  Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30 percent of the world average, offering huge potential. &amp;quot;We want to be an important part of India,&amp;quot; he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country.

In an interview with PTI, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said the intention is to become energy company of the country and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products.  IOC, which controls over 40 percent of India&rsquo;s diesel-dominated petroleum product market, recently introduced differentiated LPG for industrial users that gives flame temperature that is 80 percent higher than conventional cooking gas, thereby cutting down cooking time and saving 5-8 percent on fuel.  Also, the company has introduced hydrogen-spiked CNG that will give BS-VI (equivalent to Euro-VI) emissions from BS-IV vehicles, he said.  &amp;quot;Eventually we intend to become energy company of India and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products,&rdquo; he said.  &amp;quot;The world is changing. We intend to set up EV charging points and battery swapping stations at our petrol pumps alongside offering auto-LPG and conventional fuels. So it will be a bouquet of offering.&rdquo;  &amp;quot;Eventually we intend to become energy company of India and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products,&rdquo; he said.  IOC has already set up EV-charging points at 76 petrol pumps and battery-swapping facilities at 11 outlets.  It is also evaluating different advanced battery technologies and intends to set up a metal-air battery-manufacturing facility for EVs as well as for stationary applications.  Vaidya said being the biggest retailer, IOC faces the threat of losing market share to any new entrant.  &amp;quot;We understand that and so we are now focusing on the way we do retail,&rdquo; he said.  All the 29,800 petrol pumps of the company have been fully automated and their look and feel enhanced to match private-sector competition.  &amp;quot;Now, we are damn sure of giving Q&amp;amp;amp;Q, that is quality and quantity,&rdquo; he said.  &amp;quot;With automation done, we can guarantee that. And we now have look and feel to match anybody.&rdquo;  Public sector firms dominate India&rsquo;s fuel market but new entrants such as Nayara Energy have been chipping at their market share.  Also, Reliance Industries has renewed its interest in fuel retailing through a joint venture with UK supermajor BP Plc.  Adani Group too is eyeing the segment through a tie-up with TOTAL of France.  Public sector firms dominate India&rsquo;s fuel market but new entrants such as Nayara Energy have been chipping at their market share.  Vaidya said IOC has strong research and development (R&amp;amp;amp;D) that is bringing to market differentiated fuels.  The company has got encouraging response for its recently launched differentiated LPG and will now go for expanding its reach, he said.  &amp;quot;We have launched a differentiated LPG with the brand name Indane 'Xtra Tej&rsquo; last month for non-domestic customers. It will yield approx 5-8 percent savings in fuel consumption over normal LPG,&rdquo; he said.  Also, the company has introduced CNG spiked with 18 percent hydrogen that eliminates the need for replacing the old BS-IV fleet of vehicles as it gives emissions compliant with superior BS-VI grade, he said adding H-CNG is being dispensed from one outlet in the national capital and would soon be extended to others.  IOC has also established itself as the second-largest player in natural gas in India with a licence to retail CNG and piped cooking gas in 40 Geographical Areas.  &amp;quot;We are also aggressively promoting the use of compressed biogas, 2-G ethanol, and biodiesel produced from used cooking oil, besides integrating our refinery processes with biofuels production,&rdquo; he said.  But the fuel business is prone to volatilities that squeeze margins.  To de-risk the business, IOC plans to add petrochemical plants at all of its nine oil refineries, he said.  But the fuel business is prone to volatilities that squeeze margins.  &amp;quot;This would de-risk the fuel business. We realise that the volatility of the market can be easily controlled by having a good footprint in the petrochemical sector,&rdquo; he said.  &amp;quot;Petroleum fuels continue to be my main business as far as turnover is concerned, but profitability I intend to get from petrochemicals.&amp;quot;  The petrochemical intensity &ndash; the percentage of crude oil converted into chemicals- is low at 5-6 percent currently.  &amp;quot;We intend to take it up to 10-12 percent,&rdquo; he said.  The petrochemical intensity &ndash; the percentage of crude oil converted into chemicals- is low at 5-6 percent currently.  The firm&rsquo;s newer refineries at Panipat in Haryana and Paradip in Odisha have the petrochemical intensity of 15-20 percent which would be raised to 25 percent, he said adding all-India average being targeted is 10-12 percent.

According to Ambani, during the third industrial revolution, when information technology came to prominence, India joined the race but still remained behind, trying to catch up with the leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;quot;As we step into the fourth industrial revolution, India has the opportunity, not just to catch up with the leaders but to emerge as a global leader itself,&amp;quot; he added.  Read the full text of Mukesh Ambani's speech below:  Distinguished Leaders and Attendees,   Greetings from India.  Let me first wish all of you, and your dear ones, the best of health and safety.  I want to thank Nik, Steffen and TM Forum for inviting me to talk about the journey of Jio and our vision for India&rsquo;s digital future.  Friends,  India missed out on the first two industrial revolutions and the changes brought about by them.  During the third industrial revolution, where Information Technology came to prominence, India joined the race but still remained behind, trying to catch up with the leaders.  As we step into the fourth industrial revolution, India has the opportunity, not just to catch up with the leaders but to emerge as a global leader itself.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution is driven by the convergence of digital and physical technologies&hellip; such as Digital connectivity, Cloud and Edge computing, IoT and smart devices, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Blockchain, AR/VR and genomics.  And the three foundational requirements needed to participate in this revolution are ultra-high-speed connectivity, affordable smart devices and transformational digital applications and solutions.  Jio was conceived for India to enable this journey.  Let me first talk about connectivity&hellip;  Before Jio, India was stuck with 2G technology&hellip;  And Jio wanted to end India&rsquo;s data misery and unleash a digital revolution.  We built a world-class, all-IP, future-proof digital network that delivers the highest speeds and the best coverage across India.  While it took 25 years for the Indian telecom industry to build its 2G network, Jio built its 4G network only in three years.  And to ensure widespread adoption of data, we launched with the lowest data tariffs in the world&hellip; and made voice services completely free for Jio users.  Second, let me talk about devices&hellip;  Before Jio&hellip; over half a billion Indians were left out of the digital movement because they couldn&rsquo;t afford smartphones and had to make do with 2G feature phones.  Our young and talented Jio engineers rose to the challenge of designing the world&rsquo;s ultra-affordable breakthrough device called the JioPhone.  That provided a window to the world of limitless possibilities for over 100 million Indians in less than a year.  Third, let me now talk about digital applications and solutions.  Right from day one, Jio offered a bouquet of mobile applications and solutions that offered our customers rich content&hellip; spanning Live TV, Movies, Music, News, Magazines&hellip; in addition to other apps that addressed collaboration, financial services, payments and so on.  When we combined digital connectivity, digital devices and digital applications and solutions &hellip; the results were amazing.  Adding customers at a mind-boggling rate of seven customers every second, Jio garnered 100 million customs in just 170 days of its launch.  And India&rsquo;s monthly consumption went up from 0.2 billion GB to 1.2 billion GB&hellip; a growth of 600%... and data consumption has been multiplying ever since.  Today, India consumes over 6 exabytes of data every month&hellip; more than 30 times pre-Jio levels, just four years ago.  We have gone from 155th in the world to number ONE in mobile data consumption&hellip; in JUST FOUR years.  The Jio movement shattered the widely held belief that India is not ready to adopt advanced technologies.  Today, I can say with utmost confidence that India will play a leading role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  To further extend our global leadership in connectivity, Jio is now rolling out a high-speed, low-latency optic fiber network to more than 50 million homes and premises across 2000 towns and cities in India.  Simultaneously, we are preparing for rolling out 5G services across India.  And Jio Platforms, our digital solutions arm with its growing portfolio of over 20 start-up has built significant capabilities in areas like Cloud and Edge Computing, Big Data Analytics, AI &amp;amp;amp; Machine Learning, Blockchain, AR/ VR and IoT.  Using these technologies, Jio Platforms is in the process of creating compelling solutions for multiple industry verticals and ecosystems spanning Telecom, Media and Entertainment, New Commerce, Financial Services, Education, Healthcare and Agriculture.  We believe that these will have a transformative effect on the social, economic and full development of India.  This is just the beginning for India.  Each of these solutions, once perfected in India and proven at India-scale will be well positioned to address similar needs in other parts of the world.  Clearly, exciting times lie ahead for India and Indians.  Friends,  The Fourth Industrial Revolution has presented us a unique opportunity to create unprecedented value and prosperity for everyone in all spheres of life.  We must invest in building next-generation technology assets.  We must root out inefficiencies across the digital physical ecosystem.  We must break silos and forge winning partnerships.  Only then can we build and sustain a truly digital society.  Jio has been founded on these very values.  It has been conceived not as a business, but as a digital movement.  It is on a mission of making Digital Life a reality for 1.3 billion Indians,  It is on a mission of creating digital platforms upon which 1.3 billion dreams will thrive and flourish.  It is committed to playing a leading role in India's transformation into a DIGITAL SOCIETY and one of the leading digital economies in the world.  It will continue to dream big, and march towards its goals with audacity and fervour.  Because&hellip; for those who dare to dream, there is a whole new world to win.  Thank you very much ladies &amp;amp;amp; gentlemen and my warmest wishes for a productive virtual conference ahead.

At present, COVID-19 RT-PCR test, which is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, takes up to 24 hours to give a diagnosis.  The sources said computational biologists at Reliance Life Sciences, a subsidiary of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries Ltd, analysed more than 100 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in India and designed unique RT-PCR primers for developing quantitative-Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) kit for COVID-19 detection. RT-PCR kit is so far considered as Gold standard.  The kit, developed by scientists at Reliance Life Sciences, is named R-Green Kit (SARS COV2-real-time PCR) and has been technically validated by ICMR for satisfactory performance, the sources said. ICMR's validation process does not approve/disapprove the kit design as well as it does not certify user-friendliness.  The sources said the kit can detect the presence of E-gene, R-gene, RdRp gene of SARS COV2 virus with Actin as an internal control. As per ICMR results, the kit shows 98.7 percent sensitivity and 98.8 percent specificity.  This kit is a complete indigenous development by the R&amp;amp;amp;D scientists working at the firm, they said, adding one biggest advantage of this kit is that it is simple to use and uses readily available simple reagents and primers which can be synthesised in India. The diagnosis time is approximately 2 hours, they added.  A separate study by Reliance Life Sciences has indicated that the death rate for COVID-19 pandemic may significantly reduce by the end of 2020. The study showed mutation occurrence of structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 form more than 7,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus from 49 countries.  Statistical analysis showed an inverse correlation between the mutation rates of two proteins NSP6 and Surface glycoprotein (S) with the death rate, according to the study published in the Scientific Journal of Biology. It has been predicted that mutations of these two proteins will grow constantly, while the death rate would drop below 0.5 percent by end of 2020 in cluster I countries (India and Bangladesh).  In the study, it has been observed that the cluster II country (USA) mutation rate of NSP6 and S proteins are lower than cluster I and cluster III (Australia and NZ) countries. Therefore, it has been proposed that in cluster II country the death rate of COVID-19 pandemic will weaken later than cluster I and III countries, the study says.  Reliance also got a US patent for genetically modified microalgae that is said to defend/delay death. The United States Patent on September 8 issued the patent.

The deal is being seen as coming together of a future digital giant and a retail goliath popularly known to be the veteran of the consumer story in India.  &amp;quot;Future brings with it brands where the business models have been established over the years, a strong supply chain and a robust understanding of the Indian consumer segment. They are the pioneers who introduced the Indian common man to multi-storied hypermarkets. The ability to service the aspirations of the common man is what Future had successfully done all these years. This with the new digital ways of life powered by Reliance can create a powerful consumer ecosystem,&amp;quot; said Sreedhar Prasad, an independent e-commerce analyst.  With this deal, Future brings on table Big Bazaar, Fashion at Big Bazaar, EasyDay and Brand Factory. The deal is likely to provide Reliance Retail an additional store strength of around 18,000 across grocery and lifestyle segments.  The deal comes at a time when world over the retailers are struggling to cope up with the decline in business and the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Things became worse for Future which had been in bad financial health since the last few years. The company had a debt of Rs 12,778 crore as of September 2019, a significant increase from Rs 10,951, six months ago.  Reliance has agreed to take up the group's debt as part of the deal.  The retail market is still primarily served by the conventional brick-and-mortar stores which account for over 88 percent of the total market. The organised retail is pegged at $60 billion which is expected to witness a rise of 22-25&nbsp;percent with a market size of $140-160 billion by 2021, according to recent industry reports.  This growth is expected to be driven by economic and socio-demographic factors like growth in income, rise in nuclear families and urbanisation.  This happens at a time when even the e-tailing industry is also witnessing a massive surge. The sector which was expected to cross $200 billion by 2026 is only going to see the numbers multiply given the uptake of e-commerce as a platform in the post-pandemic scenario.  With the two companies combined together, the majority of the market share of the organised retail will fall in their kitty.  The deal is also expected to give firepower to Reliance when it fights Amazon in the grocery segment. &amp;quot;In grocery, you need small locations from where you can pick items and deliver to consumers. Some companies do it with dark stores, some do it by partnering with third-party outlets. But when you have your own store and can see what kind of inventory you have you are in a very powerful position,&amp;quot; said Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester Research.  Interestingly, Future was also reported to be in talks for a stake sale with Amazon. Amazon also already holds a 49 percent stake in a vertical called Future Coupons of the group as per a deal which was signed last year, giving Amazon around 3-4 percent stake in Future Retail.  Currently, it allows Amazon India to be the authorised online sales channel for Future's products.  It wasn't immediately clear as to what happens to this arrangement post the RIL-Future deal."

Reliance Retail is India&rsquo;s largest, most profitable retail business and is the fastest-growing retailer in the world thus far.  Its revenues are higher than the rest of the organised retailers combined.  Reliance Retail&rsquo;s business footprint spans across 11,806 retail stores in over 7,000 towns with 28.7 million sq ft of retail space.  It sells more fruits and vegetables than any of its peers. It sells more flour and oil, it sells more television, more washing machines, and more clothes.  Despite these fantastic sounding numbers that it has achieved in the 14 years since its launch, there are still some missing pieces to the retail ambitions of Chairman Mukesh Ambani.  Much of its revenue comes from consumer electronics segment. It makes up for almost 75 percent of the outlets, and about 25 percent of the revenue.  But its presence in other big segments, including groceries and fashion and lifestyle, is less intimidating.  With a total count of 800 stores, the grocery segment constitutes less than 10 percent of the stores, and 20 percent of sales.  Of all its retail stores, fashion and lifestyle retail contribute only 20 percent, but in terms of total sales&nbsp;it contributes 8 percent&nbsp;which is around&nbsp;Rs 13,500&nbsp;crore.  Even in fruits and vegetables, the unorganized segment takes over 25 percent of the total pie.  That is where the deal with Future will help Ambani get closer to his vision for the retail business.  The mega transaction with a combined value of Rs 24,713 crore cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to the ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  &ldquo;Food and grocery retail is a fragmented market, so the acquisition is more of a consolidation of market share rather than establishing leadership. Reliance Retail is by far the largest retailer already, and the takeover of Future Group's retail assets is more of a consolidation of its leadership position,&rdquo; said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of retail consultancy firm Third Eyesight.  In the last 4-5 months of lockdown, neighbourhood stores have done well, while large-format stores have lost ground. In the coming months, it will be important to see how Reliance bridges the gap with neighbourhood stores and expands its market reach using its digital footprint,&rdquo; he added.  According to Euromonitor, India&rsquo;s retail market size is about $635 billion (Rs 42 lakh crore) that is split 59:41 between grocery and other categories such as apparel, footwear and electronics.  What falls under Reliance Retail?  Reliance Retail, which was started in 2006, is the retail initiative of the group and is central to the consumer facing businesses.  Reliance Retail has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and operates chain of neighbourhood stores, supermarkets, wholesale cash and carry stores, specialty stores and online stores and has democratized access to a variety of products and services across diverse segments for Indian consumers.  Serving the food and grocery category, Reliance Retail operates Reliance Fresh, Reliance Smart and Reliance Market stores.  In the consumer electronics category, Reliance Retail operates Reliance Digital, Reliance Digital Express Mini stores and Jio stores, and in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle category, it operates Reliance Trends, Trends Women, Trends Man, Trends junior, Project Eve, Reliance Footprint, Reliance Jewels and AJIO.com, in addition to a large number of partner brand stores across the country.  What falls under merged Future Enterprises?  FRL is engaged mainly in the home and electronics retailing, value retailing and operates Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Foodhall, among other format retail stores. The deal will also involve Future Consumer, which operates the food business, and has significant links with FRL, which is its largest customer, accounting for almost 80 percent of its annual sales.  Future Lifestyle Fashions&nbsp;(FLF) was the flagship fashion business of Future Group. It so far operated in more than 400 stores in 90+ cities, occupying 5.7 mn sq ft of retail space. It ran in-house retail chains Central and Brand Factory, exclusive brand outlets (EBOs) and other multi-brand outlets (MBOs).  Similarly,&nbsp;Future Supply Chain Solutions&nbsp;provides supply-chain solutions [for non-agro products] to Future Group companies as well as to outside companies. The supply-chain company gets 65 percent of its business from FRL.  Large becomes larger  Reliance Retail, which was already the largest retailer in India by a long shot, gets even larger and bigger.  Its network gets a big push in the cities, where&nbsp;40 percent of Future stores are present. In comparison, more than two-thirds of Reliance Retail&rsquo;s nearly 12,000 stores are operating in Tier II, III and IV towns.  The company can now pick and choose which of Future&rsquo;s stores to retain and rationalize the network.  Much of the businesses will be integrated, and that will include the grocery business under Reliance Fresh, and the fashion vertical under the banner of Reliance Trends.  Reliance Retail will get the benefit of economies of scale. The products can be bought in large quantities and sold at competitive prices, and would see further improvement in margins due to improving scale.  The deal will help strengthen the vision created through the launch of JioMart, the online grocery delivery service that propels the company&rsquo;s omni-channel plans. JioMart, which is currently available only at selective cities, will now be able expand its reach.  To meet customer's requirements for essentials, the beta version of the JioMart grocery consumer platform (jiomart.com) was launched across 200 cities, followed by an app later on.  Within a few weeks of launch, JioMart was delivering over 4 lakh orders daily, which according to&nbsp;Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL) is significantly higher than any other grocery home delivery company.  JioMart, which went live in May, that saw an order flow four times that of the pre-lockdown period for partner kiranas, pointing to the potential an online-offline network has for stakeholders  Reliance Retail will ensure last-mile connectivity through tie-ups with Kirana stores in the remote region of the country. This ensures formalization of the retail sector as a whole.  Growth in retail will complement Jio&rsquo;s growth because both are consumer-centric.  The deal will help RIL&rsquo;s retail business to expand its offline retail presence and get it ready to tap O2O and B2B opportunities. With Reliance Retail having only begun its digital commerce business (JioMart&rsquo;s&nbsp;online grocery delivery business and the&nbsp;Kirana&nbsp;B2B distribution business), brokerage houses believe value creation from this business will happen only over the medium term.  What now?  After attracting a series of marquee investors to back Jio Platforms, Reliance Industries&rsquo; telecom arm, Chairman Mukesh Ambani, addressing the company&rsquo;s 43rd Annual General Meeting on July 15, indicated that the group&rsquo;s retail venture, too, has received strong interest from strategic and financial investors and plans are underway to induct some in the next few quarters.  The bar has been set high by Jio, which saw 14 deals to sell a 33 percent stake in Jio Platforms (JPL). This, together with the stake sale in the fuel joint venture and a rights issue, will help RIL raise Rs 2.1 trillion ($28 billion), and become net-debt free.  With the Future deal shoring up Reliance Retail numbers and domination in the Indian retail landscape, it may be now time for the next step.

The investment values Reliance Retail at a pre-money equity value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore.  Not very long ago, Reliance Industries (RIL) acquired a minority stake in the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, through its subsidiary Reliance Retail.  As we speak about the deal, here's all you need to know about how RIL, which once focussed on petrochemicals and oil and gas, entered the consumer business, and what it holds for the conglomerate now.  How it all began  RIL entered the organised retail segment in 2006. This was around the time that RIL was being divided between the brothers Mukesh and Anil Ambani. Christened Reliance Retail, the company started off with the launch of the first Reliance Fresh store in Hyderabad. The idea was to make buying groceries and vegetables a lifestyle experience at neighbourhood market prices. With an investment of Rs 25,000 crore, RIL's aim was to roll out this format for segments such as consumer durables, pharmacy and lifestyle products as well.  Going beyond Reliance Fresh  Reliance gradually widened its horizon across segments such as electronics, fashion and the cash-and-carry businesses. While Reliance Digital, the consumer electronic retail chain was launched in 2007, the company ventured into fashion and the wholesale cash-n-carry segments in 2008 and 2011, respectively, through Reliance Trends and Reliance Market. By 2011, Reliance Retail had achieved $1 billion in sales.  Growth of the giant  By 2014, Reliance became the largest retailer, surpassing Future Group in terms of revenue. Future Group's overall retail revenues totalled up to Rs 13,666 crore on an annualised basis for the financial year ended March 2014, at a time when Reliance Retail's revenue had shot up to Rs 14,496 crore.  Around the same time, Reliance tried to test the e-commerce space with the launch of an online grocery store, reliancefreshdirect.com to deliver groceries in Mumbai. In 2016, it made a full-fledged entry into e-commerce with the launch of curated fashion platform ajio.com. The online commerce space had already heated up with millions of dollars of venture capital money flowing into India.  Reliance was not the only offline retailer looking for an online presence. Aditya Birla Group had also launched its fashion portal, called abof.com, and Shoppers Stop had tied up with Snapdeal to open its online store. All of these companies were competing with the likes of Myntra, which had been acquired by Flipkart two years earlier.  In September 2016, RIL launched its telecom service, Jio, announcing free telecom services till at least that December. This would go a long way in shaping up how the internet was consumed in India. Meanwhile, Reliance Retail continued to grow. It notched up $10 billion in revenue in 2018.  Mergers and Acquisitions  The company went international with the acquisition of British Toy retailer Hamleys in 2019. Earlier this month, it also made a majority acquisition in online pharma company Netmeds for around Rs 620 crore and will take on the likes of Amazon and Flipkart in the segment.  Reliance Retail also has a portfolio of 46 exclusive international partner brands in the luxury segment, including the likes of Armani and Burberry.  Weathering the Covid storm  As with other retailers, Reliance Retail's numbers, too, were hit by the pandemic. Compared to the same period a year ago, Reliance Retail&rsquo;s revenue declined 17 percent to Rs 31,663 crore during the quarter ended June 30. The company reported a net profit of Rs 431 crore despite 50 percent of its stores being fully shut and 29 percent operating partially.  Growth of JioMart  Reliance Retail's online consumer grocery platform JioMart, which was launched in April, has become immensely popular. With over 10 lakh downloads, it is behind only Amazon and Flipkart in terms of app downloads.  JioMart currently offers groceries and other essentials and plans to introduce new categories, including electronics and fashion. It is learnt to be currently receiving 2.5 lakh daily orders from 200 locations across India.

The mega transaction, which also includes the wholesale, logistics and warehousing business of the Future Group, has a combined value of Rs 24,713 crore and cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to its ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into&nbsp; Future Enterprises Limited (FEL).  As a part of the scheme,  	the&nbsp; retail and wholesale Undertaking is being transferred to&nbsp; Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Limited (RRFLL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RRVL( Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd) 	the logistics &amp;amp;amp; warehousing undertaking is being transferred to RRVL 	RRFLL also proposes to invest Rs 1200 crore in the preferential issue of equity shares of FEL to acquire 6.09 percent of post-merger equity and Rs 400 crore to acquire warrants convertible into equity shares of FEL, which will result in RRFLL acquiring further 7.05 percent of FEL.  &ldquo;The acquisition of the retail, wholesale and supply chain business of the Future Group complements and makes a strong strategic fit into Reliance&rsquo;s retail business. This will help Reliance retail to accelerate providing support to millions of small merchants in increasing their competitiveness and enhance their income during these challenging times,&rdquo; said Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd in its official statement.  &ldquo;Future&rsquo;s portfolio composition in apparel, general merchandise and own FMCG brands will allow for a wider offering to its customers,&rdquo; the firm further added. RRVL reported a consolidated turnover of Rs 162,936 crore and net profit of Rs 5,447.96 crore for the year ended March 31, 2020.  The deal with Future Group also makes Reliance Retail more attractive for potential global partners and suitors. Addressing shareholders in RIL's 43rd annual general meeting, Mukesh Ambani had said the company has &amp;quot;received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail.&amp;quot;  Speaking on the mega deal, Isha Ambani, Director, Reliance Retail Ventures said, &amp;quot;With this transaction, we are pleased to provide a home to the renowned formats and brands of Future Group as well as preserve its business ecosystem, which have played an important role in the evolution of modern retail in India. We hope to continue the growth momentum of the retail industry with our unique model of active collaboration with small merchants and kiranas as well as large consumer brands. We are committed to continue providing value to our consumers across the country.&amp;quot;  THE ROAD AHEAD FOR FUTURE GROUP  The deal was crucial for Biyani-led Future Group which came under immense pressure from the lenders' consortium led by SBI to address its rising debt which stood at Rs 12,778 crore as of September 2019.  In its official statement, Future Group said, &ldquo; Post this exercise, FEL will emerge strong with businesses in manufacturing and distribution of FMCG products and integrated fashion sourcing and merchandising. These businesses will further benefit from supply agreement with RRFLL. This deal will also enable FEL to focus on the creation of new-age brands in the FMCG and fashion space and expand its reach. The transaction will help FEL to expand with a focussed business model and a stronger balance sheet.&rdquo;  &ldquo;As a result of this reorganisation and transaction, Future Group will achieve a holistic solution to the challenges that have been caused by COVID and the macro-economic environment. This transaction takes into account the interest of all its stakeholders including lenders, shareholders, creditors, suppliers and employees giving continuity to all its businesses,&rdquo; said Kishore Biyani, Group CEO, Future Group.  &ldquo;We are pleased that our strong retail franchise and brands, that we have created over time, are going in stronger hands and will continue to grow and delight Indian shoppers,&rdquo; Biyani added.  THE RESCUE ACT BY RELIANCE RETAIL   Biyani&rsquo;s exit from a business he had painstakingly built over three decades was forced by a rising pile of debt and the searing pain wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through Saturday&rsquo;s deal, Reliance Retail, controlled by Ambani, Asia&rsquo;s richest man, has emerged as a white knight and thwarted the collapse of a vast retail group that would have otherwise been dragged through India&rsquo;s bankruptcy court.  The folding up of a group that showed to the world the potential of India&rsquo;s retail market would have cast a long shadow on how the world perceives this crucial service sector growth engine of the economy and re-rate its prospects down. It would have also been read as an example of India&rsquo;s diminishing potential as a marketplace.  The takeover now by Reliance Retail, will essentially give a fresh lease of life to what is an absorbing Indian entrepreneurial story. The deal is good news for lenders of Future Group who will now have secured outstanding loans protected as well as the retail ecosystem comprising small businesses and suppliers. Employees who would have otherwise stared at salary cuts and job losses now could get absorbed because Reliance Retail is aggressively expanding across India.  &ldquo;The buyout of the logistics and warehousing segments of Future Group will help Reliance Retail take on Amazon which has been traditionally strong in these segments. Post this deal, Reliance Retail will now sell a wider range of products under one roof and domestic retail players who focus on specific segments will stand to get marginalised,&amp;quot;&nbsp;said market veteran SP Tulsian.  Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries has been diversifying its business and shoring up its retail presence ahead of a big-bang listing. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, it pushed the grocery business heavily and also launched JioMart, rivalling the likes of Amazon and Walmart backed Flipkart. Recently, it also made a foray into online pharmacy and acquired a majority stake in Netmeds for Rs 620 crore. Reliance Retail&rsquo;s business footprint spans across 11,806 retail stores in over 7,000 towns with 28.7 million sq ft of retail space.  Khaitan &amp;amp;amp; Co and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas advised Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd on the transaction, both law firms said in separate releases.

But, if the bidders for the recently-concluded IPL title sponsorship bids are seen as any indication, it can be seen that none of the old-economy companies explored the prospect of associating with the most popular T20 tournament in the world.  Dream11, Unacademy and Byju's were the three entities which submitted bids while Tata Sons, which had evinced interest, did not place a bid, much to the BCCI&rsquo;s chagrin.  Tata Sons and BCCI could not come to an agreement over the number of categories available for sponsorship. The fact that it was the only old-economy to confirm its interest in the rights shows the dwindling interest of the corporate houses and the emergence of startups and new-age companies in the cricket ecosystem.  Before Vivo, the IPL was sponsored by leading brands such as DLF and Pepsi while the Indian cricket team's official jersey sponsorship rights were held by the likes of ITC and Sahara. Star India also held the rights for three years.  The last time two big corporate entities jostled for the official jersey rights was in 2010 when Sahara secured the rights by paying Rs 3.34 crore compared to Airtel's Rs 2.89 crore per international game offer.  Corporate India's big foray into cricket board sponsorship came in 1987 when Reliance Industries became the title sponsor of the World Cup, which was being held outside England for the first time.  Other companies like Hero MotoCorp and Reliance Communications have also been associated with the International Cricket Council as commercial partners.  In 2019, Byju's replaced Oppo as the jersey sponsor, thus sending a signal that the startups are willing to splash the cash to catch the eyeballs.  Also Read: IPL 2020 | How Dream11 fended off Chinese connection concerns to clinch title sponsorship rights   But, in the past few years, the BCCI has not seen many top companies lining up to bid for the jersey or title sponsorship rights.  In 2017, when Star's contract with BCCI was coming to an end and bids were called, two Chinese handset manufacturers were in the fray &ndash; Oppo and Vivo. Oppo offered to pay Rs 1,079 crore, almost double the BCCI's reserve price of Rs 538 crore.  In 2019, Paytm bagged the BCCI title sponsorship rights until 2023 for Rs 326.8 crore.    &amp;quot;It is not just Indian companies, even MNCs such as Pepsi, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Vodafone and Nike have been steadily showing declining interest. Whether it is value perception only or combined with an indifferent attitude of cricket administrators towards sponsors that is keeping them away, is tough to say,&amp;quot; Harish Thawani, founder of Nimbus Communications, told Moneycontrol.  Thawani said apart from new-age brands like Paytm, Byju&rsquo;s and Dream11, the rest simply cannot afford the investment in cricket.  Also Read | Dream11 wins IPL title sponsorship: Here's how big is the fantasy sports gaming market in India   &amp;quot;The landscape changes every few years. It was dominated by Pepsi, LG, Samsung, Hero MotoCorp, Vodafone and Airtel Now, the Chinese brands and some new-age brands are dominating. Two years from now, there will be others,&amp;quot; he said.  Saurabh Uboweja, Managing Partner of managing consulting firm BOD Consulting, feels the cricket sponsorship segment is following the worldwide trend of brands catering to youngsters garnering the bulk of sports sponsorship deals.  &amp;quot;The new-age companies follow the new trends. If you look at the digital gaming segment, it is massive and it makes sense for Dream11 to bid for the rights. Earlier, it used to be the likes of Oppo and Vivo, which used to target the new-age customers. Whenever brands take sponsorship of sports events, they look at the target audience. Earlier, Pepsi and Coca-Cola used to heavily sponsor cricket tournaments but of late due to people&rsquo;s perception of cola-based drinks, they have stopped spending heavily in that segment. A brand like Amul is now trying to reinvent itself and has focused a lot on sports sponsorships. A brand which is already young in terms of image will always try to go all out in terms of associating with sports properties,&amp;quot; he told Moneycontrol.  Jagdeep Kapoor, brand guru and Chairman and Managing Director, Samsika Marketing Consultants, said the big Indian companies have missed a golden chance of propelling their brands opportunity by passing up the opportunity to associate with this year's IPL.  &amp;quot;Big Indian companies missed a great opportunity as IPL is a great property. In brand building and sponsorship, companies need to have a long-term view. The traditional companies have a vision but they are going for revision and slashing their marketing budgets. You can&rsquo;t be cutting your nose to spite the face. Dream11 has got a goldmine and is a good move from their point of view. According to me, the established players have missed out on a great opportunity,&amp;quot; he told Moneycontrol.  With COVID-19 putting a dent on the finances of India Inc, it was widely speculated that the BCCI would have a tough time in getting a deal similar to the one they had inked with Vivo. Ultimately, Dream11 has offered to pay Rs 222 crore for this year and the cricket board will have to look for associate sponsorship slots to reduce the deficit.  So, has the BCCI been able to salvage the situation vis-a-vis the IPL sponsorship?  &amp;quot;In the pandemic affected market, to get 50 percent of what Vivo was paying is a reasonable result. But one hears other central sponsors have pulled out too. So, let's see how that pans out,&amp;quot; said Thawani.

The deal values Netmeds around Rs 1,000 crore.  The acquisition gives RIL&rsquo;s retail unit Reliance Retail entry into a vertical e-commerce space, one of the few that has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to its online grocery platform JioMart.  Founded by Pradeep Dadha, Netmeds currently delivers medicines, personal and baby care items, and provides doctor bookings and diagnostics on its website and app. It has been looking for a buyer for nearly a year now, after it was unable to raise a large round of funding.  Its investors include Singapore-based Daun Penh Cambodia Group, Sistema Asia Fund, Tanncam Investment and healthcare-focused investment firm OrbiMed.  Listen: Setting Sail podcast | Wow Momo may cut jobs in September, business still not back to pre-Covid level: Sagar Daryani  Isha Ambani,&nbsp; Director, Reliance Retail Ventures, said in a statement, &ldquo;The addition of Netmeds enhances Reliance Retail&rsquo;s ability to provide good&nbsp; quality and affordable healthcare products and services, and also broadens its digital&nbsp; commerce proposition to include most daily essential needs of consumers.&rdquo;  A scrum of startups have fiercely fought in e-pharmacies for a few years now on the thesis that delivering medicines for chronic illnesses regularly could be a springboard to becoming a large internet company. Netmeds, PharmEasy, Medlife, 1mg, etc have been jostling for space. However, margins in medicine delivery are minimal, and investors will not fund money-losing startups unless they are market leaders.  The pandemic however turned this notion on its head. The segment has benefited from many first-time customers flocking to these apps as they were forced to order medicines from home during lockdown. Moneycontrol reported on August 7 that these apps have seen orders surge 50 percent and taken the sector forward by two years in the last three months.  According to people close to the deal, although RIL was eyeing the sector, and Netmeds, even before the pandemic hit, the lockdown helped close the deal, find the right valuation and proved the business thesis.  Last week, Amazon India rolled out its e-pharmacy service in Bengaluru, with plans to launch in the rest of the country soon.  The entry of these conglomerates, to some extent, gives the sector long-term prospects. Barring PharmEasy, every other startup in the sector has been battling for survival, struggling to raise funds and been eyeing mergers with larger rivals.  &ldquo;It is a good outcome for both sides. Netmeds needed to survive and find a home. RIL wanted to enter the sector, but not pay a very high tech-style valuation,&rdquo; said an investor in the space, requesting anonymity.  The deal fuels Jio&rsquo;s desire to have a full-fledged ecommerce platform, delivering goods of all kinds. Acquiring distressed startups has been a step in this direction. It is reportedly in talks to acquire online furniture startup Urban Ladder, online lingerie retailer Zivame and online milk delivery startup Milkbasket.

The deal was to close by March but has been delayed.  &amp;quot;With regard to the Reliance deal, all I can say at this stage (is that) it's going through the due diligence,&amp;quot; Nasser said in June quarter earnings call with investors.  &amp;quot;So, depending on the due diligence, we will make our decision after we complete the due diligence on that deal.&amp;quot;  According to the transcript of the investor call, he went on to state that the deal to buy a stake in the world's largest single-location oil refining complex and India's biggest petrochemical assets &amp;quot;is a big deal. So, we need to take our time to review and then decide based on the outcome of the due diligence study&amp;quot;.  Ambani had at RIL's annual general meeting last month stated that the Aramco deal had been delayed &amp;quot;due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the COVID-19 situation&amp;quot;.  He neither said if the deal was on track nor gave any fresh timelines for its completion. Nasser too did not give timelines for completion of the deal saying discussions with Reliance were still on and shareholders will be updated &amp;quot;in due course&amp;quot;.  RIL's O2C business comprises of the company's twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, petrochemical plants, and 51 percent in fuel retailing venture. The deal may have been delayed over valuations, sources said.  Last month after RIL's AGM, Bernstein had stated that: &amp;quot;The sell-down of a 20 percent stake in the refinery and chemical business to Aramco for $15 billion has not progressed as planned, given changes in market conditions. We believe a deal is still possible although at a lower valuation, closer to our estimate of $57 billion gross&amp;quot;.  To facilitate the deal, Reliance had earlier this year decided to spin off the O2C business into a separate subsidiary, and Ambani last month said that process is likely to be completed by early 2021.  But for him, the urgency of the Aramco deal has diminished after RIL amassed over Rs 2.12 lakh crore from sale of nearly 33 percent stake in the conglomerate's digital arm Jio Platforms, rights issue and selling 49 percent stake in fuel retail business to BP.  This money helped the oil-telecom-to-retail conglomerate to become a zero net debt company nine months ahead of the target.  &amp;quot;Our equity requirements have already been met,&amp;quot; Ambani had said in the AGM. With a stake, Aramco would not just have a share in one of the world's best refineries and the largest integrated petrochemical complex but also access to one of the fastest-growing markets -- a ready-made market for 5 lakh barrels per day of its Arabian crude and a potentially bigger downstream role in future.  It will make the world's biggest crude exporter join the ranks of the top oil refiners and chemical makers, and help it reach its goal of more than doubling refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels a day.  Last week, BofA Securities in a report said with the Saudi Aramco deal, &amp;quot;RIL will be able to better utilise its refinery capabilities with availability of several grades of crude oil from super light to heavy being supplied by Aramco&amp;quot;.  The partnership going ahead will leverage the O2C value chain to maximise margins and meet the evolving needs of consumers by supplying energy, base chemicals and new materials.  The strategic partnership with Aramco will help in increasing its crude oil to chemicals conversion ratio, which presently stands at 20 per cent. &amp;quot;With the deal, RIL will get technological expertise from SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corporation), in which Aramco recently bought a controlling stake,&amp;quot; it had said.  For Aramco, it creates a long-term crude supply contract of 0.5 million barrels per day (about 5 percent of current production) to RIL's Jamnagar refinery, with reduced demand risks. Aramco currently covers only about 40 percent of its crude output via refining and strives to increase it further.  &amp;quot;It would give Aramco the opportunity to participate in Indian market growth story where demand will likely be strong over the next two decades,&amp;quot; it added.

Within a few weeks of launch, JioMart was delivering over&nbsp;four lakh orders daily, which according to Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL) is significantly higher than any other grocery home delivery company.  &ldquo;Orders have continued to scale up since inception,&rdquo; it said. After the lockdown was announced on March 24, customers struggled to buy groceries and other essentials from established e-retailers like Big Basket, D-Mart Ready, Big Bazaar and Amazon. The sudden spike in orders led to delays and even cancellations as restrictions on the movement of people and goods hobbled these companies. Kirana shops came to the rescue of harried customers. JioMart connected them to their smaller but efficient neighbourhood grocery stores. &ldquo;Grocery witnessed strong customer traction as stores remained open, though with restrictions on operations and products to be sold. Apart from continued momentum in staples, categories such as hygiene products and packaged foods did particularly well leading to higher bill values,&rdquo; the company said. During its 43rd Annual General Meeting (AGM), RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said JioMart is now accepting over 2.5 lakh orders daily from across India and the number is rising fast with each passing day.&nbsp;&amp;quot;The USP of JioMart is its smart store price promise. JioMart offers attractive prices on essentials with a minimum 5 percent discount on all products.&amp;quot; The bouquet of JioMart products now includes a wide range of personal care products, home and kitchen care products, puja needs, shoe care, baby care products, branded foods etc.  Despite the challenging environment brought about the novel coronavirus pandemic, where store functioning and digital commerce fulfilment was severely impacted by the lockdown and restrictions (50 percent stores were fully shut and 29 percent partially operated), Reliance Retail clocked significant revenue of Rs 31,633 crore and an operating profit of Rs 1,083 crore in Q1 FY21. Growth plans JioMart is in the process of expanding its partnership with&nbsp;kirana stores across more cities.&nbsp;&ldquo;Expansion across cities is underway with many more kirana partners are being on-boarded,&rdquo; the company said. JioMart launch It was on April 26, four days after Reliance Retail signed a deal with Facebook-owned WhatsApp, that JioMart went live in Thane, Kalyan and Navi Mumbai after five months of a soft launch. On May 23, RIL expanded its JioMart service to customers across several cities after successfully conducting a pilot across Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan and launched website jiomart.com to place an order.  JioMart app JioMart, Reliance Retail&rsquo;s beta online consumer grocery platform, recently went live on Apple and Google Play Stores.  A few days since its launch, the app crossed 10 lakh downloads.&nbsp;JioMart is&nbsp;one of the most popular apps in Google&nbsp;Play Store&rsquo;s &lsquo;shopping&rsquo; category, third only behind Amazon and Flipkart.  The app is also the second most popular app in the &lsquo;shopping&rsquo; category on Apple&rsquo;s app store.  JioMart was launched with an aim to compete with Amazon and Flipkart, the companies that have dominated India&rsquo;s e-retail space."

The combined performance of these businesses helped the company top projections of analysts and fend off the coronavirus slowdown with the first quarter results released on July 30. RIL reported a consolidated profit of Rs&nbsp;13,248&nbsp;crore for the first quarter of FY21 with Jio's ARPU growth of 7.4 percent QoQ at Rs 140.3 per subscriber per month beating&nbsp;Street expectations.  &amp;quot;The severe demand destruction due to global lockdowns impacted our hydrocarbons business but the flexibility in our operations enabled us to operate at near normal levels and deliver industry leading results,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  &amp;quot;Our consumer facing businesses became the life-line for individuals and businesses with our Retail and Jio teams working hard to ensure millions got essential goods and services through the lockdown,&amp;quot; he added.  Consolidated profit during June quarter 2020 (which included exceptional gain of Rs 4,966&nbsp;crore from stake sale to BP in Reliance BP Mobility)&nbsp;increased 102.4 percent sequentially and the year-on-year increase was 30.6 percent.  Consolidated profit in March quarter 2020 stood at Rs 6,348 crore and Rs 10,141 crore in the corresponding period of last year.  In the March quarter, the company had reported an exceptional loss of Rs 4,267 crore due to fall in oil prices. Profit before the exceptional item was at Rs 10,813 crore.  RIL beat D-Street estimates in what according to most analysts was a tough quarter. Jio, Retail, and oil-to-chemical (O2C) all contributed to fight COVID induced slowdown.  Reliance's consolidated revenue for the quarter stood at Rs 1,00,929 crore compared to Rs 1,51,461 crore QoQ and Rs 1,74,087 crore year-on-year.

Ambani said Reliance Industries completed the largest fund raise in Indian Corporate history in this quarter. I thank the millions of individual investors who supported our Rights Issue and welcome all our new partners to an exciting new phase of growth at Reliance.&rdquo;  RIL's digital unit Jio Platforms, which raised Rs 1,52,056 crore during the quarter under review from some of the world&rsquo;s top tech investors led by Facebook, was one of the few companies to have grown during the coronavirus lockdown.  With the fund raising from stake sale in Jio Platforms,&nbsp;Rights issue of Rs 53,124 crore and stake sale to BP in petro-retail&nbsp;joint venture, Reliance achieved its net debt free target in June 2020, which is well ahead of its timeline March 31, 2021.

Average revenue per user (ARPU) for the June quarter at Rs 140.3 per subscriber per month grew by 7.4 percent compared to Rs 130.6 in previous quarter. It was much higher than street expectations.  Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital told CNBC-TV18 that there is no&nbsp;reason why Jio ARPU won't go up further. &amp;quot;Retail will be the next big galloping horse.

The stock touched a record high of Rs 2,198.70 on July 27 and brokerages increased their target price due to deleveraging of the Balance Sheet and stake sale in Jio Platforms to global investors and technology players.  In fact, it has been the biggest gainer among Nifty stocks, rising 145 percent from its March 23 low, and gaining 41 percent year-to-date.

Revenue was expected at Rs 15,800&nbsp;crore with&nbsp;EBITDA at Rs 6,700&nbsp;crore and margin at 42.4 percent for the quarter, according to CNBC-TV18 poll estimates.  Two RIL platforms -- JioMart and JioMeet -- which were rolled out during Q1 benefitted from huge downloads.  JioMart beta version was launched in 200 cities to meet consumer needs. Both voice and data traffic surged.  Reliance Retail:&nbsp;Against the backdrop of a challenging environment, where store functioning and digital commerce fulfilment was severely impacted by lockdown and restrictions (50 percent stores were fully shut, 29 percent partially operated), Reliance Retail clocked significant revenues of Rs 31,633 crore and EBITDA of Rs 1,083 crore in the quarter, company said.  &amp;quot;The performance whilst muted by the operating context, was well ahead of market,&amp;quot; it added. Retail revenue in June quarter 2019 was at Rs 38,216 crore and EBITDA at Rs 2,060 crore.  RIL said EBITDA was positive and resilient despite the limitations in the quarter, with cost management initiatives leading to fixed cost savings, which helped cushion the impact of lower profits from lower sales.  Despite gross margin expansion and cost savings, EBITDA margin was impacted by fixed costs and adverse mix (with the most profitable Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Lifestyle categories being hit the hardest), coming in at 3.8 percent during the quarter against 6.0 percent during the corresponding period of the previous year, it added.  Reliance said the quarter saw 21 percent growth year-on-year across the operational businesses of Grocery and Connectivity, while Consumer Electronics and Fashion and Lifestyle businesses were hit particularly hard by the cessation of activity during the lockdown period, as stores were closed for the most part of the quarter.  On the petrochemicals front, Reliance said revenue for Q1FY21 declined by 33 percent YoY to Rs 25,192 crore primarily due to lower price realizations with disruptions in local and regional markets amid COVID-19 outbreak.  EBITDA for the quarter declined 49.7 percent YoY to Rs 4,430 crore. &amp;quot;Weak domestic demand and higher share of exports impacted margins as compared to regional benchmarks. The impact of lower realization was partially offset by cost optimization and integration benefits,&amp;quot; company said.  Q1 was a very challenging quarter as due to lockdown, domestic industry and supply chains virtually came to a halt as both producers and converters shut down plants across India, it added.  In case of refining and marketing business, Reliance said revenues for June quarter 2020 declined by 54.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 46,642 crore due to lower crude oil price and lower throughput.  Brent crude price averaged at $29.2 a barrel during the quarter versus $68.8 a barrel in Q1FY20, down 57.6 percent YoY.  Regional Benchmark Singapore Complex Margins turned negative for the first time in 2 decades and averaged at $-0.9 a barrel.  Reliance said its gross refining margins at $6.3 a barrel was impacted by lower product cracks and narrower light-heavy crude differential. However, it maintained a significant premium of $7.2 a barrel over regional benchmark margin.  Refining and marketing EBITDA declined to Rs 3,818 crore (down 25.8 percent YoY) due to weak margin environment and lower throughput, RIL said, adding refining segment profitability was sustained through optimized crude procurement, relatively higher utilization, cost management and agile product placement.  RIL is now one of the 50 most valued companies globally with a market capitalisation of Rs 13.92 lakh crore at its record high price.  Promoters' shareholding stood at 50.37 percent in the June quarter up from 50.07 percent in the March quarter, while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) raised their stake to 24.72 percent from 24.05 percent in the same period.

Many companies, including the likes of&nbsp;Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra Financial Services,&nbsp;PVR,&nbsp;Shriram Transport Finance,&nbsp;Aditya Birla Fashion, Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL), have offered their shareholders a chance to solidify their holding at a time when investor confidence is riding high despite the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country.  Ample liquidity due to stimulus packages from central banks and relatively cheap valuations in the aftermath of COVID-19-led crash&nbsp;could have been the fillip companies needed to opt for rights issue as the preferred means of raising funds as opposed to&nbsp;qualified institutional placements (QIP), experts suggested.  &amp;quot;It is understood that when valuations are stretched, companies usually raise capital via QIP route. And when shares are reasonably priced or are undervalued, promoters generally raise additional capital for growth through a rights issue, giving a chance to existing shareholders to buy the stock at a discounted price,&amp;quot; said&nbsp;Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities.  According to Shah, investors should not always view raising funds as a quick fix to a bleeding balance sheet but should rather concentrate on why the company is raising funds. In many cases, companies use the funds for capital expenditure which is a telling sign that the management is optimistic about the growth prospects of the company.  &amp;quot;...raising of funds also shows the management&rsquo;s confidence in the growth of their company. It is not always the case that additional capital is raised only because the company&rsquo;s balance sheet is bleeding. Capital can also be raised to accentuate growth and expansion,&amp;quot; she said.  A rights issue is a mechanism for listed firms to raise additional capital by inviting existing shareholders to buy new shares proportionate to their existing holding at a discount to the prevailing market price.

According to the management of the company, the rights issue is&nbsp;their way of thanking shareholders in the company's silver jubilee year. And thankful they were, as the scrip climbed over&nbsp;10 percent on July 20, the announcement date. Although, the sharp rise can also be attributed to the stellar returns the company posted for the&nbsp;quarter ended June 2020.  The pricing of the issues was also hailed by analysts Moneycontrol spoke to. They believe that the company has multiple moats including a strong rural presence.&nbsp;Efficient cost control along with low borrowing cost also puts the company is a favourable position  &ldquo;The announcement of the rights issue at a steep discount of Rs 50 against July 17's closing of Rs 207 per share is likely to be taken positively by the market.

According to media reports, the Ajay Bijli-owned firm intends&nbsp;to utilise the net proceeds from the issue towards repayment or prepayment of the principal and or interest of certain borrowings availed by the company. PVR may also use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  PVR, which has 176 properties and a total of 845 screens across India, had completed a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in October 2019. The fundraising round led to an inflow of Rs 500 crore.  Part of the&nbsp;QIP proceeds was utilised towards prepayment of existing debt obligation.

Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd&nbsp;also came out with a Rs 995 crore rights issue this month.&nbsp;The issue opened for subscription on July 8 and will close on July 22.  The main objectives of the fundraising are to cut leverage, strengthen the balance sheet and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, the apparel company, which owns brands including Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Peter England, and Pantaloons, said.  Experts Moneycontrol spoke to advised subscribing to the issue given&nbsp;ABFRL's strong management as well as its growth prospects once the pandemic is contained and the economy fully re-opens.  &amp;quot;The rights issue is structured similarly to that of Reliance Industries where shareholders will have to make payments in three tranches. As the lockdown is gradually lifted, retail stocks seem to be in a rebound mode. The factors like manageable leverage, consistent execution capability, healthy cost-cutting initiatives and strong parentage might help ABFRL emerge much stronger from the current crisis,&amp;quot; said Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor.

The company's wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies.  According to sources, Reliance Jio on July 17 requested for 800 megahertz of frequencies in the 26 gigahertz (Ghz) and 24 Ghz band as well as 100 Mhz in 3.5 GHz band for running field trials in &amp;quot;urban centres like Delhi and Mumbai&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Jio has said that high frequencies has been put to use in advance countries like the US, South Korea, Japan, Canada, the UK.&nbsp;They also want trials in these bands should start in India to make India &amp;quot;Aatmanirbhar&amp;quot;.

In its pitch for starting trials in higher spectrum band, Jio in the letter has said that the US, South Korea, Japan etc have started working in 28 Ghz band and some other countries in 26 Ghz band and therefore it wants to run trials of its 5G technology before selling it abroad.  In the 43rd annual general meeting, Reliance Industries Limited Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said that Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch.  &amp;quot;This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India&hellip; using 100 percent home grown technologies and solutions.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-headquartered bank expects the deal street to be driven by both consolidation in the sectors impacted by the pandemic and financial institutions raising growth capital.  Raj Balakrishnan, the head of India investment banking at BofA says, the pandemic is unlike any other previous crises, which were business crises.  &amp;quot;A company that was being run perfectly well till February may not be viable now for no fault of the management, as its business may be hit due to the lockdowns. Further, the same company may be perfectly fine once lockdown is over and normalcy returns as long as it has sufficient liquidity to sail through the crisis,&amp;quot; Balakrishnan told PTI, expressing confidence in the broader business recovery.  That is why, he said, raising capital is now the key to help emerge as a winner.  Thanks to Reliance Industries selling over a quarter of its stake in its subsidiary Jio Platforms, the deal street was vibrant clocking nearly $44 billion in H1 of 2020, up 14.5 percent YoY.  Between late April and June, Reliance sold nearly 25 percent in Jio Platforms to 10 investors, including Facebook, which snapped up 9.99 percent for over Rs 43,000 crore. Then it sold 15 percent more, collectively raising Rs 1.2 lakh crore including through the largest rights issue of Rs 53,124 crore in June.  Others who lapped up minority stake in Jio for $15.27 billion include Silver Lake Partners, General Atlantic, KKR and others. The selling spree continued in July with Google picking up 7.7 percent for over Rs 33,700 crore.  According to industry tracker Mergermarket, BofA stood second in the i-banking league table with deals worth $6.7 billion in the first half, capturing 17.6 percent market share. Morgan Stanley topped the list with $13 billion across nine deals.  BofA was one of the bookrunners of the largest rights issue by Reliance worth Rs 53,124 crore in June. The bank also exclusively advised Facebook for its stake-buy in Jio.  BofA also executed block deals for Standard Life Aberdeen (in HDFC Life and HDFC AMC) and for Blackstone in Embassy Office Parks REIT.  SBI Cards IPO, the largest initial share listing in nearly a decade, and Avenue Supermart's (DMart) QIP and OFS are some of the other big deals executed by BofA this year.  And deals continue to be worked on.  &amp;quot;We have a strong pipeline of deals and we are confident, the second half will be equally busy,&amp;quot; Balakrishnan said.  Companies hit by the pandemic would try to sell down their non-core businesses, and it would be another opportunity for investment bankers, he added.  Balakrishnan has multiple reasons for being optimistic on the deals front.  &amp;quot;A lot of minority stake sale is happening across India Inc and we will see some sales driven by portfolio choice as well. You will also see quite some activity in the e-commerce space where consolidation is likely,&amp;quot; he added.  In June alone, BofA handled six market transactions raising over $8.5 billion for clients. The deals included Standard Life Aberdeen selling 5.6 percent in HDFC AMC for $378 million through OFS, the RIL rights issue of $7.1 bullion, and Blackstone selling stake in Embassy Office Parks REIT for $500 million among others.  &amp;quot;We were the busiest i-banker on the street amid a challenging and volatile market backdrop. From the landmark $7.1 billion RIL rights issuance, which is the largest ever capital market transaction in the country to $18 million Andhra Paper OFS &mdash; we were there adding the most relevant investor colour and helping our clients access liquidity,&amp;quot; he said.  According to Mergermarket, Morgan Stanley and BofA have picked nearly half of the $43.5-billion deals in H1, through just 11 of the 72 deals.  But in terms of volume, the period saw 24.7 percent fewer deals at 183 as against 243 YoY.  Morgan Stanley led the league table completing nine deals worth $13.53 billion.

Stake sales in Reliance's digital unit Jio Platforms attracted not just private equity and sovereign wealth funds but also Google and Facebook, a strong endorsement for an enterprise that until a few years ago focussed largely on oil refining.  Some industry watchers equate Reliance's digital plans - which extend from online shopping and cloud computing to telecom and digital payments - to China's Alibaba and Tencent, companies Reliance itself calls &amp;quot;global peers&amp;quot;.  Reliance has a track record of disrupting rival businesses. With cheap smartphones and data plans, its telecom venture Jio has in four years dethroned market leaders Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to become the largest telecom operator in India.  On Wednesday, billionaire chairman Mukesh Ambani said Reliance will expand e-commerce platform JioMart - which connects small retailers with consumers - to offer not just groceries but also electronics and fashion goods.  &amp;quot;Jio Platforms not only has the backend infrastructure and development capabilities but also an ever expanding captive consumer base,&amp;quot; said Mayank Vishnoi of Singapore-based financial advisory firm Resfeber International.  &amp;quot;The addition of new digital products targeting various sectors will pose threats to many large dominant players. Having strategic partners like Facebook and Google validates that Reliance gameplan is real.&amp;quot;  The recent stake sales gave Reliance a foreign partner for JioMart, which was launched this year. Facebook's WhatsApp, which counts India as its top market with 400 million plus users, will work closely in connecting small retailers to JioMart.  &amp;quot;We will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand to many more categories,&amp;quot; said Ambani.  Asked about the potential impact on foreign businesses eyeing India, one local industry executive who advises US multinationals said: &amp;quot;Amazon and Walmart should be scared.&amp;quot;  To be sure, Reliance will face stiff competition from Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart, as both companies have deep pockets and an already well-established warehousing and logistics supply chain in the country.  JioMart currently delivers groceries in only 200 cities, while Amazon and Flipkart deliver a wide range of goods across the country.  Walmart, Flipkart and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  &amp;quot;REAL THREAT&amp;quot;  Reliance also has a retail footprint of around 11,000 stores across 6,700 cities that offer a wide array of products. It has also partnered with over 45 top international brands including Tiffany &amp;amp;amp; Co, Burberry and Jimmy Choo.  Senior leadership at Flipkart has started keeping close tabs on Reliance, and there is a fear the Indian company will have an added advantage from the regulatory perspective, two sources close to the company told Reuters.  The Ambani family is viewed as being well-connected politically. Amazon and Walmart have had regulatory troubles and face far tighter government oversight in India, where the prime minister has been promoting self reliance.  Reliance's digital plans extend beyond e-commerce.  On Wednesday, the company said it will develop education and healthcare solutions via its JioMeet video conferencing tool that saw 5 million users within days of its launch this month. JioMeet has a starkly similar design to its rival, US based Zoom Video Communications.  Zoom said this month it had plans for a significant investment in India. Asked about Reliance, Zoom said it had experienced intense competition in the past but we &amp;quot;know what it takes&amp;quot; to become a platform of choice.  &amp;quot;This threat is real,&amp;quot; one US tech executive in India said about Reliance. &amp;quot;As of now, it's not changing the game, but that view can change in a year from now.&amp;quot;  Disclaimer:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani emphasised on &amp;quot;Made in India&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Made-for-India&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Made-for-the-World&amp;quot; products, which might boost investors trust as nation tilted over Made in India products.  However, a set back for the conglomerate is the deal with Saudi Aramco, which has not progressed with the original timeline due to pandemic and some unfavourable events in the oil sector. But Ambani said he is committed to this partnership. Had the deal got announced it might have boosted street sentiments.  Some of the announcements which I really like are 'target to become net carbon-neutral by 2035' and another big announcement by the chairman is that Google will invest over Rs 33,000 crore in Jio Platforms.  Way ahead, Jio is ready with a world-class 5G solution and its field deployment might be carried in next year. Also, Ambani focused on Made-in-India 5G Solution.  Although, the market has discounted announcements but RIL is worth holding for mid to long term, with a target of Rs 2,600, implying 40.9 percent potential upside from current levels. Investors should try to add the stock in any healthy correction as RIL is likely to outperform the index and might lead the benchmark.

That enticing proposition became a reality on July 15 at the 43rd &mdash; all-virtual &mdash; annual general meeting (AGM) of Reliance Industries (RIL). Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a Rs 33,737 crore investment by Google for a 7.7 percent stake in Jio Platforms, marking the end of a gargantuan, unparalleled fundraising exercise.  This is the first and biggest investment by Google under its India digitisation fund, which was launched earlier this week. The fund is looking to pump in nearly $10 billion in India over the next five to seven years and nearly half of that amount went to Jio.  On April 22, global rival Facebook invested Rs 43,574 crore to pick up a 9.9 percent stake in Jio Platforms, sealing the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Indian tech sector. Nearly half of the famed FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) stocks of the US market have now bet on the RIL subsidiary.  Funding blitzkrieg In less than four months, Jio Platforms has attracted a staggering Rs 152,056 crore from a total of 13 investors by shedding around 33 percent stake. These investors include Silver Lake, Vista, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton, PIF, Intel and Qualcomm.  Consequently, Jio Platforms now commands an eye-popping equity valuation of Rs 4.36 lakh crore based on the latest bet by Google, reflecting its standing as a digital powerhouse, and not just a telecom player.  &ldquo;Look at the valuation and the sheer quality of names &mdash; leading strategic investors, blue-chip private equity funds and sovereign wealth funds. What else can one ask for? Some of the investors may look to exit post listing. Going forward, timing the IPO based on market conditions will be crucial,&rdquo; said a capital market deals advisor on condition of anonymity.  In the past, RIL has indicated plans to list Jio Platforms in the next few years.  The oil-to-telecom conglomerate has raised a combined Rs 212,809 crore through its record Rs 53,000 crore rights Issue, investments in Jio Platforms, and Rs 7,269 crore from an investment by British Petroleum in its fuel retail joint venture. The feat has no parallel in Indian corporate history.  Rs 212, 809 crore! Let that figure sink in. It&rsquo;s more than one percent of India&rsquo;s GDP and it was raised by RIL during the coronavirus pandemic, the most disruptive even in modern human history.  The figure far exceeds the net debt of the diversified conglomerate, which stood at Rs 1,61,035 crore at the end of March 31.  The gap would have been wider if unforeseen circumstances in the energy market had not delayed the progress of the Saudi Aramco deal. In August 2019, RIL announced plans to sell a 20 percent stake in its flagship chemicals and refining business to Saudi Aramco in a deal valued at $15 billion. But for now, the biggest takeaway for shareholders is that RIL is truly a zero net debt company, well ahead of Ambani&rsquo;s initial target of March 2021.  &ldquo;Our target for capital raise is now complete and we now look forward to only adding strategic partners who share our vision in each of our current and future businesses,&rdquo; Ambani said during his AGM speech.  Follow all of our coverage on&nbsp;RIL's 43rd annual general meeting here.  One milestone after another Recently, RIL crossed another milestone and became the first domestic firm to cross the Rs 12 lakh crore market capitalisation mark. From the lows of March, the share price has surged more than 100 percent.  According to a report by CNBCTV-18, it is the best performing mega-cap stock and ranks among the only non-American company in the top five best-performing stocks globally.  Market analysts have highlighted the promoter&rsquo;s investor centric approach and commitment to the debt reduction exercise in a challenging market.  &ldquo;RIL saw an opportunity in adversity during the lockdown period. Despite the Aramco deal getting delayed, due to the excellent infrastructure of Jio and the firm&rsquo;s execution capabilities, it managed to raise more than Rs 1,52,000 crore. The record rights issue was an additional cushion and the deferred payment facility and the willingness of the promoters to subscribe to the entire issue before its closure gave confidence to investors,&rdquo;&nbsp;said market expert SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com.

The partnership could be a game-changer not just for Jio and Google but for consumers&nbsp;as well.  Affordable 5G Android smartphones Ambani revealed that the company has already sold more than 100 million Jio Phones in a short period. However, more than 350 million feature phone users remain in the country and to bring them on board, it will bring in an entry-level 4G or even 5G smartphone at a fraction of its current cost.

The partnership is mainly focused on jointly develop an affordable smartphone with optimisations to the Android operating system.  India is the world&rsquo;s second-largest market for smartphone users. While more than 550 million people have access to the internet, a large majority remain disconnected from the virtual world. The partnership with Jio will also help Google achieve its vision of providing access to people coupled with its Next Billion Users initiative.  Gateway to services and the Jio ecosystem of apps Ambani aims at making India 2G-mukt with the Jio-Google partnership. By offering affordable 4G and 5G smartphones running on Android, the partnership will not only give millions of people access to the world of internet but also open doors to a host of new services.  For example, Google&rsquo;s own family of apps, which includes the likes of Gmail, Maps, Duo, etc, will help people connect virtually and make life more convenient.&nbsp; Moreover, the company announced&nbsp;new services at the RIL 43rd AGM like the JioTV+.

The Made-in-India 5G technology can be deployed and launched in a year once spectrum is available, said the RIL chairman on July 15. Moreover, Jio can easily upgrade its 4G network to 5G because it is an all-IP network architecture, further saving on hardware, time and costs.

It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 43rd&nbsp;Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited.  Dear Shareholders,  The corona crisis is the most disruptive event in modern human history. The resultant economic crisis has compounded the global community's hardships.  However, I have no doubt India and the world will achieve faster progress, greater prosperity and a new quality of development post the Covid crisis.  And, I also strongly believe that every adversity presents multiple new opportunities. Take this AGM itself.  All of us are participating in it through&nbsp; our brand-new&nbsp; digital&nbsp; product &ndash; called&nbsp; JIOMEET. JIOMEET, since its release a few days ago has already been downloaded by more than 5 million users. It is India's first and only cloud-based video-conferencing app.  And you will be proud to know that it has been built by a young Jio Platforms team in just two months.  1.&nbsp; Business &amp;amp;amp; Financial Performance  Dear Friends, The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2020 have already been circulated to you. With your permission, I would like to take them as read.  Reliance had yet another year&nbsp; of record performance. Reliance became the first Indian company to exceed market capitalisation of $150 billion. Reliance is also the first Indian company to cross ₹ 1,00,000 crore in consolidated EBITDA.  The earnings from our O2C and Upstream businesses declined due to the challenging market environment.  Yet, the consolidated performance was up 10% over the last year due to strong growth in Organized Retail and Digital Services businesses.  Our consumer businesses continued to deliver hyper growth with an EBITDA growth of 49% this year. Consumer businesses&nbsp; today contribute&nbsp;&nbsp; about 35% of our consolidated EBITDA. Just five years ago, nearly all of our EBITDA was from our energy and materials business.  Since then, our consumer and technology businesses have rapidly achieved scale by their exponential growth.  Dear Shareholders,   Reliance's seminal contribution to the Indian economy remains unmatched. Here are a few snapshots:  At ₹ 202,830 crore, we continue to be India's largest exporter accounting for 9.1% of India's total merchandise exports across 109 countries.  We are India's highest payer of customs and excise duty in the private sector with payments of over ₹ 21,660 crore. We are amongst the highest payers of GST and VAT at ₹ 69,372 crore.  We are amongst the highest payers of Income Tax in the private sector paying ₹ 8,386 crore.  Dear Shareowners,  In last year's AGM speech, I had shared my goals of growing our businesses through partnerships and achieving a Net Debt Free Balance Sheet.  I am happy to report that we have fulfilled this promise well ahead of the timelines that we had set ourselves.  In a short span of a few months, we have raised a record amount of capital and forged several new strategic partnerships.  We&nbsp; completed&nbsp; India's largest-ever&nbsp; ₹ 53,124 crore Rights Issue. This was also the world's largest Rights Issue by a non-financial institution in a decade. This was over-subscribed 1.59 times, setting another record in the Indian capital markets.  A unique feature of RIL's Rights Issue was that it was completed entirely on a digital platform during the lockdown period.  None of the stakeholders - regulators, bankers, financial institutions, retail investors and others - had to step out of their offices or homes for it.  This showcased India's potential to be a pioneer and an innovator in this Digital Age.  Dear Shareholders - Thank you for making the Rights Issue a phenomenal success.  Dear Friends,   Let me take a few minutes to warmly welcome our new and esteemed partners in Jio.  First, Facebook, a global technology powerhouse and a leading social media and internet company as our premier strategic partner.  After Facebook, we have investments from some of the most admired technology and financial investors - Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, TPG and L Catterton.  All of them have a long history of successfully investing in the best of technology and growth enterprises in the world. Intel and Qualcomm, who have shaped the semi-conductor industry, are at the heart of the digital ecosystems.  We will work with them to develop new products for India and Indians.  I look forward to working with each of them in a collaborative way to build on Jio Platforms' portfolio of technology and solutions.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome three of the world's largest Sovereign Wealth Funds &ndash; ADIA and Mubadala of the UAE, and PIF of Saudi Arabia &ndash; as our valued partners.  We are grateful to all our partners. What they bring is more than money. They bring faith in the Indian economy's immense growth potential.  They also bring a strong vote of confidence in our bold mission, and our ability to execute it. We look forward to working with all of them and generating value to all our stakeholders.  Dear&nbsp; Friends,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As we end our current cycle of capital raising, we are delighted to welcome another strategic partner into Jio. A company that needs no introduction, because it is a household name in India and globally.  A company that has pioneered search engine and operating systems that are used across the world.  Let&nbsp; me&nbsp; welcome,&nbsp;Google&nbsp;to&nbsp; be&nbsp; our&nbsp; strategic&nbsp; investor in Jio Platforms. Today, we have signed a binding partnership and an investment agreement with GOOGLE&hellip; under which Google will invest ₹ 33,737 crores for a 7.7% stake in Jio Platforms.  This transaction is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.  With this investment by Google, strategic and financial investors have committed a total of ₹ 152,056 crore in the last few months.  We have also concluded our JV with BP in our existing fuel retailing business. BP has invested ₹ 7,629 crore for their 49% stake in the JV.  Cumulatively, we have raised a total of ₹ 212,809 crore through our Rights Issue, the combined investments in Jio Platforms, and investment by BP.  This is unprecedented in the history of capital markets in India. Indeed, there would be very few parallels globally.  This capital raise is significantly in excess of our Net Debt of ₹ 161,035 crore at the end of FY19-20. Reliance is now truly a zero Net Debt company, well ahead of my goal of March 2021.  We now have an extremely strong Balance Sheet that will support all our growth plans for our three Hyper-Growth Engines &ndash; Jio, Retail and O2C.  Our target for capital raise is now complete and we now look forward to only adding strategic partners who share our vision in each of our current and future businesses.  2.&nbsp;Jio/ Digital Services  Dear Friends,  Let&nbsp; me&nbsp; start&nbsp; with&nbsp; our&nbsp; first&nbsp; Hyper-Growth&nbsp; Engine&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp; JIO&hellip;&nbsp; our&nbsp; digital&nbsp; service&nbsp; initiative.&nbsp; I would like to first share with you the philosophy that animates Jio's current and future initiatives. The Digital Revolution marks the greatest disruptive transformation in the history of mankind.  Comparable only to the appearance of human beings with intelligence capabilities on our planet about 50,000 years ago.  It is comparable because man is now beginning to infuse almost limitless intelligence into the world around him. We are today at the initial stages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the evolution of an INTELLIGENT PLANET. Unlike in the past, this evolution will proceed with a revolutionary speed.  Our world will change more unrecognizably in just the eight remaining decades of the 21st century than today's world has changed from what it was 20 centuries ago.  For the first time in history, mankind has an opportunity to solve big problems inherited from the past. This will create a world of prosperity, beauty and happiness for all.  India must lead this change to create a better world.  For this, all our people and all our enterprises have to be enabled and empowered with the necessary technology infrastructure and capabilities.  This is Jio's purpose.  This is Jio's ambition.  Friends,  JIO is now the undisputed leader in India&hellip; With&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; largest&nbsp;&nbsp; customer&nbsp;&nbsp; base&hellip; the largest share of data and voice traffic&hellip;  and a world-class next-generation broadband network that covers the length and breadth of our country. As always&hellip;  We&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deeply&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thankful&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appreciative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customers&hellip;&nbsp; for their trust&hellip; and for giving us the privilege to serve and delight them every single day. This year&hellip; 2020&hellip; will forever be etched in human consciousness because of COVID-19&hellip;  Almost overnight&hellip; all of us became reliant on DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY&hellip; to stay connected&hellip; to stay healthy&hellip; and to stay productive.  I can say with pride, that during these past months&hellip; JIO has become the digital lifeline for Indians. Despite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; huge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traffic,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JIO's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; network&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; held&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firm&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and we continue to deliver on our promise of being an essential service provider to the nation.  Friends,  Jio's vision stands on two solid pillars. One is Digital Connectivity.  The other is Digital Platforms. We have now fully kickstarted all the FIVE ACCELERATORS of growth of DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY. ONE&hellip;  Mobile broadband.  TWO&hellip;  JIOFIBER&hellip; our optical-fiber based, Gigabit-speed HOME BROADBAND service. We have already connected over a million homes on JIOFIBER&hellip;  And our growth will accelerate as we gear up to connect millions more over the coming months in the post-COVID period.  THREE&hellip;  JIO's ENTERPRISE BROADBAND service&hellip;  In combination with powerful cloud solutions, this is enabling Indian enterprises to make rapid strides towards digital transformation&hellip; and global competitiveness.  FOUR&hellip;  BROADBAND for SMALLAND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES&hellip;  Jio's enterprise-grade voice and data services&hellip; and cloud-based solutions&hellip; are bringing Indian SMEs from zero connectivity and zero technology&hellip; to operating with the same efficiency as large connected enterprises.  And FIVE&hellip;  Jio's Narrowband Internet-of-Things &ndash; or NBIoT &ndash; service&hellip;  We use our pan-India 4G network to connect billions of smart sensors&hellip; with the highest reliability and lowest cost.  Friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In the next THREE years, I can see a strong path for Jio to connect Over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HALF A BILLION mobile customers; Over a BILLION smart sensors; and&nbsp; Over 50 million HOMES and BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS.  But, what is perhaps not so well known is that JIO's global-scale 4G and FIBER network is powered by several core software technologies and components&hellip;  that have been developed by young Jio engineers, right here in India.  And this capability and know-how that JIO has developed, positions JIO on the cutting edge of another exciting frontier&nbsp;&ndash; 5G.  TODAY,&nbsp;Friends,&nbsp;I have great pride in announcing&hellip; That JIO has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch.  This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India&hellip; using 100% home grown technologies and solutions.  This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available&hellip; and can be ready for field deployment next year.  And because of JIO's converged, all-IP network architecture&hellip; we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G.  Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio Platforms would be well positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally, as a complete managed service.  I dedicate Jio's 5G solution to our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's highly motivating vision of &lsquo;ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT&rsquo;.  Friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   JIO PLATFORMS is conceived with this vision&hellip; of developing original, captive INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY&hellip; using which we can demonstrate the transformative power of technology across multiple Industry ecosystems &hellip; First in India&hellip;  And then confidently offering these Made-in-India solutions to the rest of the world.  Applications like MyJio and Jio SAAVN have already become household names and are used by hundreds of millions of loyal customers each month.  JIO PLATFORMS, along with its over 20 start-up partners who are now part of our family, has built significant world- class capabilities in several cutting-edge technologies&hellip;  ONE&hellip; 4G and 5G technologies TWO&hellip; Cloud Computing  THREE&hellip; Devices and Operating Systems FOUR&hellip; Big Data Analytics  FIVE&hellip; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence SIX&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reality SEVEN&hellip; Block Chain  EIGHT&hellip; Natural Language Understanding NINE&hellip; Computer Vision&hellip;  Using these technologies, we can create compelling solutions that span multiple Industry verticals and ecosystems&hellip; like Media&hellip;  Financial&nbsp;&nbsp; Services&hellip; New Commerce&hellip; Education&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthcare&hellip; Agriculture&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cities&hellip; Smart Manufacturing&hellip;and Smart Mobility.  These are the technologies and ecosystem solutions that hold the power to achieve 360-degree digital transformation of India.  Our start-up partners have contributed significantly to our strengths across many of these areas&hellip; And we are inviting even more start-ups to join forces with us.  Friends,  With its 100% owned Intellectual Property&hellip; total solutions approach&hellip; and the opportunity to serve a global audience&hellip;  Over the years, Reliance has built deep domain knowledge in most of the Industry verticals that are key to the Indian economy&hellip;  and JIO PLATFORMS can combine this domain expertise with its technology strengths to create multiple innovative ecosystem solutions and managed services for our country.  Each of these solutions, once proven in India, has the potential to be a global solution&hellip; that can be used to serve the rest of the world.  I am setting a goal for JIO PLATFORMS to pursue this global opportunity and to create a significant source of revenue from both the domestic and global markets.  I believe that the time has come for a truly global digital product and services company to emerge from India, and to be counted among the best in the world.  Friends....  At this point, let me pause&hellip;  and invite Isha, Akash and Kiran on to our virtual stage&hellip; to demonstrate a few of the magical solutions that JIO has been working on recently&hellip;  DEMO FOLLOWS&hellip;  Thank you&nbsp; Isha, Akash and Kiran&hellip; for that sampling of the exciting solutions that Jio is developing.  Friends,  Given Jio's ambitions to be a global technology, platforms and solutions company,&nbsp; It is important that we keep the company of the best technology enterprises in the world. Last year, we announced our partnership with MICROSOFT&hellip;  And I am happy to report that we are making rapid progress in our Azure cloud partnership.  As I mentioned to you earlier, we are privileged to enter into another strategic partnership with FACEBOOK, one of the very best technology companies in the world.  We had announced our partnership in April of this year, and we have now received all the necessary regulatory approvals.  Both Facebook and Jio share a strong vision for digitally empowering consumers as well as small businesses and entrepreneurs across India.  And now&hellip; I want to share with all of you&hellip; a message from the CEO of FACEBOOK &ndash; MARK ZUCKERBERG. Which he made at the time of the announcement of our partnership.  Transcript of Mark Zuckerberg  &ldquo;Hi everyone. I know there's a lot going on around the world right now, and I hope you are all staying healthy and safe. I want to share an important update. Facebook is joining forces with a new partner in India &ndash; we're making a major financial investment, and we will become the largest minority shareholder in Jio Platforms. More than that, we're also committing to work together on some critical projects that we think will open up a lot of opportunities for commerce in India.  India is a special place for us, it's home to the largest communities around the world on Facebook and WhatsApp, and there are a lot of talented entrepreneurs. It is also in the middle of a major digital transformation that's being led by organizations like Jio that over the last four years have put hundreds of millions of Indians on to the internet. And that's a big deal, because when people get access to the internet, digital tools, they are powered to do a whole lot of new things  &ndash; learning, teaching, finding communities, people they care about, and of course starting all kinds of new businesses.  This is really important especially right now, because small businesses are at the core of every country's economy, and they need our support. India has more than 60 million small businesses and millions of people rely on them for their jobs and livelihoods. Lot of entrepreneurs now need tools they can rely on to help them find and communicate with their customers and to grow their businesses. Now, with a lot of communities around the world in lockdown, it's even more important now than ever that people have the tools to connect with each other, and their businesses can find ways to operate online. This is something that we think we can help with, which is why we are proud to be partnering with Jio to help people and businesses in India create a lot of new opportunities. We are going to share more on this soon.  So I want to thank Mukesh Ambani and the entire Jio team for your partnership. I think we are going to build a lot of great things that people find valuable in their daily lives, and importantly that make it easier to live and easier to do business. This is an important moment for all of us, and I want to personally extend a welcome to all others who want to get involved and help in this effort. We're looking forward to getting started. So, thank you and I hope you all continue staying healthy and safe.&rdquo;  Thank you, MARK.  WhatsApp&hellip; which is a FACEBOOK product&hellip; is already the platform of choice for Indians and Indian businesses to connect with each other.  Over 400 million WhatsApp users in India bring unique value to our partnership.  Jio's New Commerce platform&hellip; JioMart&hellip; and Whatsapp will be working closely to create growth opportunities for millions of Indian small merchants and kirana shops&hellip;  And to ensure that consumers are able to transact seamlessly with nearby kiranas using JioMart and WhatsApp.  Friends,&nbsp;  Let me now talk about our partnership with Google.  From day one&hellip; it has been Jio's commitment to provide affordable 4G devices to more than 450 million feature phone users in India.  It was with this intention&hellip; that a couple of years back&hellip; we developed the JIOPHONE&hellip; which still remains the world's most affordable 4G phone.  Now&hellip; even though we have sold over 100 million JIOPHONES till date&hellip;  there are many featurephone users who are waiting&hellip; to upgrade to a conventional SMARTPHONE&hellip; if only it were somehow more affordable.  So, we have decided to address this challenge head-on.  We believe we can design entry-level 4G&hellip; or even 5G SMARTPHONE&hellip; for a fraction of its current cost.  But, to power such a value engineered smartphone, we also need an equally value-engineered smartphone operating system...and such an operating system must be designed with India in mind.  Google and Jio are partnering to build an Android-based smartphone operating system.  Through this partnership, we are confident that we can accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian.  As India is standing at the doorsteps of the 5G era, we should accelerate the migration of 350 million Indians, who currently use a 2G feature phone, to an affordable smart phone.  They should not be deprived of the benefits of the digital and data revolution. Jio is determined to make India 2G-mukt.  On this occasion&hellip; we have with us a special guest to talk about this partnership&hellip;  &hellip; the CEO of GOOGLE And a proud Indian icon&hellip;  &ndash; SUNDAR PICHAI.  Transcript of Sundar Pichai Video:  &ldquo;Thanks, Mukesh, and to the entire team at Reliance Industries, for all the work you do to give millions of Indians the power to shape their destiny through technology. And thank you for the opportunity to share a few words about what our new partnership means to Google.  Getting technology into the hands of more people is a big part of Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Through this partnership with Jio Platforms we see the chance to have an even greater impact than either company could have alone.  This partnership is a key part of the next chapter of investment in India. Earlier this week we announced our Google for India Digitization Fund, an effort to invest 75,000 crore rupees or approximately $10 billion -- to accelerate India's digital economy over the next 5 to 7 years.  Our investment of $4.5 billion in Jio is the first -- and the biggest -- investment we will make through this fund. I am excited that our joint collaboration will focus on increasing access for hundreds of millions of Indians who don't currently own a smartphone...while improving the mobile experience for all.  Growing up I remember how the arrival of each new technology improved the lives of my family. Today, people in India no longer have to wait for technology to come to you. A whole new generation of technologies are happening here, first. At the same time, smartphones and affordable data have made it possible for a billion Indians to come online. Reliance, and Jio in particular, deserves a good deal of credit for this progress.  But there is more work to do to connect every Indian to the opportunities that technology creates.This goal is especially important at a time of enormous challenge for India and the world. I've never been more hopeful about India's future -- it's a future we can help shape by partnering together.  Thank you for having me. I wish you strength and good health in the months to come.&rdquo;  Thank you, Sundar, for your wonderful words.  We&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; truly&nbsp;&nbsp; blessed&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; world-class&nbsp;&nbsp; partners&nbsp;&nbsp; like&nbsp;&nbsp; Facebook,&nbsp;&nbsp; Google&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their company, we are even more confident of reaching the ambitious goals that we have currently identified.  And in a large market like India, I am sure we will find even more areas where we can work together.  Friends,&nbsp;  Our journey thus far&hellip; and our road ahead&hellip; is possible&hellip; most of all&hellip; because of the talented and passionate people who are part of the Jio Family.  And in this family, we count our employees, our strategic partners, our technology partners, our channel partners&hellip; and the many start-ups who have partnered with us.  Just&nbsp; a&nbsp; few&nbsp; decades&nbsp; back,&nbsp; Reliance&nbsp;&nbsp; itself&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; start-up&hellip; And as a less-than 4 years old company, JIO is still very much a start-up.  As such&hellip; we have a very special place in our heart for start-ups&hellip; whom we consider our brothers-in-arms. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; believe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start-ups&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JIO.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are well positioned to help Indian start-ups in a number of ways&hellip;  Whether it be in technology development&hellip; product development&hellip; distribution&hellip; market access&hellip; or even scale-up capital&hellip;  We are ready to integrate them into our roadmap and to help them reach their full potential.  We believe that this would be the true measure of success for Jio&hellip; to create a mighty Knowledge Coalition that solves Indian problems&hellip;  and opens the doors for many more companies from India to step successfully on to the global stage.  Friends,&nbsp;  Together, I am confident that Jio, and this extended Jio Family&hellip; will play a leading role in India's transformation into a DIGITAL SOCIETY&hellip; and one of the leading digitally-enabled economies in the world.  Let me now present the success of our media and entertainment.  Our Network18 Group's 72 channel-strong TV broadcast network across News and Entertainment reaches more than 800 million Indians.  Our digital properties are now used by almost 200 million people every month. We are amongst the top 10 digital news players across sectors.  We&nbsp; are consolidating our media and distribution businesses. Den and Hathway are being merged with Network18 and TV18, subject to regulatory approvals. This will make the Network18 group the largest listed media and distribution company in the country.  	Organised Retail  Dear Shareholders,  Reliance Retail has been at the forefront of bringing about the Organized Retail Revolution in India.  At the heart of our business is our relentless commitment to serve customers at scale to meet their everyday needs by providing extreme value and convenience.  We do this by partnering with farmers, small and medium-scale manufacturers, merchants, vendors, start-ups and global companies.  Last year, Reliance Retail revenues were ₹ 162,936 crore and EBITDA was ₹ 9,654 crore. We are India's largest and most profitable retail business.  Reliance Retail is the fastest growing retailer in the world, and the only Indian Retailer to feature in the Top 100 global retailers.  And we continue to be a partner of choice for marquee international brands.  I applaud the Retail team for ensuring the supply of essentials to our consumers, despite enormous constraints during the lockdown.  Dear Shareowners,   In the last five years, our revenues in the retail business have grown 8 times and our profits 11 times. This positions us well in the years ahead to continue delivering on our promise of exponential growth. Four things that give me huge satisfaction are:  First, more than two-thirds of our nearly 12,000 stores are operated in Tier II, Tier III and Tier IV towns.  Second, the deep-rooted bond with tens of thousands of farmers that has helped us source over 80% of our fresh fruits and vegetable directly from farmers.  We&nbsp;&nbsp; sell&nbsp;&nbsp; more&nbsp;&nbsp; fruits&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; vegetables&nbsp;&nbsp; than&nbsp;&nbsp; any&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organised&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retailer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country. Third, we continue to provide large employment and development opportunities for lakhs of people across India. Fourth, our growth model is based on partnership with small merchants and shopkeepers.  Dear Shareowners,  Last year, I spoke about our New Commerce initiative, JioMart.  JioMart is a tech-enabled partnership that will link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands and consumers.  And will reduce inefficiencies thereby creating more value for everyone in the retail ecosystem. Connecting farmers and delivering their fresh produce directly to homes is a key part of our grocery strategy. This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; significantly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; improve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farmer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; income&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incentivise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; higher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; productivity New Commerce will transfer significant new value to consumers, producers and merchants.  I am happy&nbsp; to&nbsp; report that we&nbsp; are&nbsp; accelerating the rollout of JioMart. Currently, we have successfully piloted our JioMart grocery model&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kirana partners. We are also piloting&nbsp; the&nbsp; beta&nbsp; version&nbsp; of the JioMart&nbsp; grocery&nbsp; customer&nbsp; online&nbsp; platform&nbsp; in&nbsp; 200&nbsp; cities. Within a few weeks of launch, we have reached over 250,000 orders a day and the numbers continue to grow each day. JioMart is now focused on scaling its geographical reach and delivery capabilities.  JioMart is obsessed with providing convenience and a superior shopping experience to consumers.  In addition to grocery, we will expand JioMart to cover electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare in the days ahead.  In the coming years, we will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand to many more categories.  Dear Shareowners,  Today&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognizes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hyper-growth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inclusive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model. We have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail. We will induct global partners and investors in Reliance Retail in the next few quarters.  I will keep you informed about the progress of Reliance Retail, which is at the doorsteps of continued exponential growth.  4. Oil to Chemicals And Oil and Gas  Dear Shareowners,   Now I will present our plans to transform our energy and materials businesses into a new growth engine. The year gone by, was the most challenging for global refining and petrochemical industries.  Even in this uncertain and volatile environment, our O2C business outperformed the sector and delivered an EBITDA of ₹ 55,394 crore.  Globally this year, business and consumer activity had come to a halt leading to unprecedented demand destruction and dislocation of margins.  Despite that, I am glad to report that all our manufacturing facilities continued to operate at over 90% capacity utilisation.  During India's lock-down, we leveraged our deep understanding of global markets and successfully enhanced our petrochemical and fuel exports by over 2.5 times in just two weeks.  I am proud to share with you that in April 2020, our O2C business accounted for nearly 50% of India's exports. I applaud the entire O2C Business and Manufacturing Teams for their agility and focus.  We have commissioned India's first Butyl Rubber plant, which places us amongst the world's top ten producers of Butyl Rubber.  Our O2C business has competitive feedstock streams that are the building blocks for specialty and new value chains of Acetyls, Acrylates, Phenols and Polyurethanes.  Reliance has been approached by global companies for strategic partnerships in its petrochemical business, including in utilizing these feedstocks.  These potential partnerships will help us build competitive manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to serve the deficit Indian market that still depends on large-scale imports of chemicals.  With this we will have an integrated and competitive Oil to Chemicals portfolio which is valuable to global companies as it provides access to the large and growing Indian market.  Last year, I shared with you the basis of equity investment by Saudi Aramco in our O2C business.  Due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the Covid-19 situation, the deal has not progressed as per the original timeline.  Our equity requirements have already been met.  Nevertheless, we at Reliance value our over two-decade long relationship with Saudi Aramco and are committed to a long-term partnership.  We will approach NCLT with our proposal to spin off our O2C business into a separate subsidiary to facilitate this partnership opportunity.  We expect to complete this process by early 2021.  Dear Friends,   BP is our valued partner in the Upstream Energy Business.  We expect to restart the KG-D6 towards the end of the year and provide India with Natural Gas, which is one of the cleanest fossil fuels.  We have further strengthened our relationship with BP, who have invested into our existing Fuel Retailing business under a new brand of Jio-bp.  Based on our combined strengths, Jio-bp will provide new age mobility solutions to Indian consumers.  Dear Friends,&nbsp;  Let me now share with you Reliance's long-term vision, beyond O2C and how we are re-imagining our entire energy platform.  Our guiding purpose is prosperity for all people and prosperity for our planet, before prosperity for energy companies.  The catastrophic impact of Climate Change calls for the legacy energy industry to reinvent itself on a war footing.  Furthermore, the world needs access to clean and affordable energy and this must be met, as it is a pre-requisite to ensuring quality of life for all people.  To meet these twin challenges, the energy industry must understand that fossil fuels and renewables are not mutually exclusive or contradictory.  The first three Industrial Revolutions based on fossil fuels disturbed the natural Carbon Cycle on Planet Earth. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has the opportunity to repair and restore the Carbon Cycle.  Here, Mother Nature is our best teacher. She wastes nothing and recycles everything.  So it is imperative that the energy industry adopts a clean, circular, sustainable and planet-friendly model that delivers green and affordable energy to all the 7.8 billion people on the planet.  This is what will drive our progress towards a cleaner planet for a safer humanity. This can be achieved by making CO2as a recyclable resource, rather than treating it as an emitted waste.  While Reliance will remain a user of crude oil and natural gas, we are committed to embracing new technologies to  convert our CO2&nbsp;into useful products and chemicals.  We have already made substantial progress on photosynthetic biological pathways to convert our CO2&nbsp; emissions at Jamnagar into high value proteins, nutraceuticals, advanced materials and fuels.  We will develop next-gen carbon capture and storage technologies. We are evaluating novel catalytic and electrochemical transformations to use CO2&nbsp;as a valuable feedstock. Reliance also has proprietary technology to convert transportation fuels to valuable petrochemical and material&nbsp;building&nbsp;blocks. And at the same time, we will replace transportation fuels with clean electricity and hydrogen. We will combine our strengths in digital, power electronics, advanced materials and electrochemistry to build full stack electrolyser and fuel cell solutions in India.  We will build an optimal mix of reliable, clean and affordable energy with hydrogen, wind, solar, fuel cells and battery.  Transforming our energy business to tackle one of the biggest challenges before India and the World is our new growth opportunity.  On successful implementation of this strategy, we target to become net carbon-zero by 2035.  We have a 15-year vision to build Reliance as one of the world's leading NEW ENERGY and NEW MATERIALS COMPANY.  It will be a platform company which will execute our vision in a worldwide collaborative model.

More than a business, this is our seva to save Planet Earth from the ravages of Climate Change. We shall spare no effort in realising this dream.  From time to time, I shall apprise you of our progress in this business  5. Reliance Foundation and Reliance Family's Crusade Against Covid-19  Dear&nbsp; &nbsp;Friends, Let me now welcome Nita to talk about Reliance Foundation. Thank you, Mukesh.  Esteemed shareholders,  Namaskar.  As I speak to you for the first time ever in a Reliance AGM, I feel a profound sense of humility and gratitude.&nbsp; All of us have witnessed the unprecedented pain, uncertainty, and suffering that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing.  That is why, Mukesh and I decided that we should do all that we can, in performing our humanitarian, patriotic, and collective duty in this hour of national need.  It is my privilege to share with you some of the work that the Reliance Family has done in the past four months &ndash; and continues to do so, each day and every hour:  First: Within days of the Coronavirus outbreak, we set up India's first 100-bed exclusive COVID-19 Hospital in Mumbai, in just two weeks.  Today, this facility has 250 beds.  Our brave-heart doctors and nurses have been working selflessly and tirelessly in service of our fellow Indians.  In your work, humanity has placed their hope and faith.  With folded hands, I express my deep gratitude to all healthcare workers who have dedicated themselves to fighting this battle!  I would like to share with you a few glimpses of the exemplary efforts of our front-line warriors&hellip; When the pandemic broke out, one of the earliest challenges was the shortage of PPEs.  It was critical to protect our healthcare workers and provide them with the right armour so that they could fight valiantly at the forefront!  In record time, we turned around our manufacturing facility to produce over 1 lakh PPEs and N95 masks every single day.  And that too at one third the price of imported PPEs, as we remain committed to the &ldquo;Make In India&rdquo; mission.  That's not all. Every business in the Reliance Family has done their bit and contributed to India's fight against COVID-19.  The team at Reliance Retail is working overtime to provide essential supplies daily to millions of Indian families across 200 cities.  Jio is providing digital connectivity to over 40 crore individuals, empowering over 30,000 organizations to work from home&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; and lacs of students to learn from home.  Reliance has also been providing free fuel to Emergency Service vehicles across the country.  This is not just business for us.  It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; duty,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dharma,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seva&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nation. That brings me to another form of Seva, which is closest to my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliance Foundation's Mission Anna Seva &ndash; our pledge to feed needy Indians. In our culture, Anna Daan is Maha Daan.  Through Mission Anna Seva, we have provided more than 5 crore meals to marginalised communities, daily-wage earners, and frontline workers across the country.  We are humbled that our Mission Anna Seva has become the largest meal distribution programme undertaken by a corporate foundation anywhere in the world.  This would not have been possible without the untiring efforts and dedication of the entire team of Reliance Foundation, and all our volunteers and partner organizations.  We are also grateful to our two lakh employees of Reliance who have gone beyond their call of duty, to serve our fellow citizens.  This has been a deeply fulfilling journey for all of us.  Friends,&nbsp;  The war against coronavirus is far from over.  Reliance Foundation is gearing up to partner with the government and local municipalities, for mega-scale COVID testing across India, with the help of Jio's digital infrastructure.  And I assure you, as soon as the corona vaccine becomes available, we will volunteer by using the same digital distribution and supply chain, to ensure that the vaccine reaches every nook and corner of our country&hellip;&hellip;.  For Mukesh and me, being of service to our nation has given us a deep sense of satisfaction.  We are so proud of our Reliance Family's contribution to India's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and their efforts to help alleviate the suffering of our brothers and sisters.  Please join me in applauding and saluting&hellip;  All our doctors, nurses, medical personnel and staff of Sir H. N. Reliance Foundation Hospital and other Reliance Foundation hospitals;  All scientists and researchers at Reliance Life Sciences; All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation; And all our colleagues at Reliance Retail and Jio;&nbsp; You have made RELIANCE proud, INDIA proud.  Friends,  This year, Reliance Foundation is celebrating its 10th year of 'Transforming Lives' across India.  Over the last decade, our Foundation has touched the lives of over 36 million people, in the remotest corners of our country.  As the Foundation enters its next decade, my daughter Isha and her young team are determined to enhance our scale and impact &ndash; more than ten times.  Using Jio's digital power, we aim to make affordable healthcare and quality education accessible to every Indian. Along with education, sport forms the bedrock of any society, especially a young society like ours.  Children have a special place in my heart. When children learn and play, communities grow and countries prosper.  Through our Education and Sports for All initiative, Reliance Foundation has so far reached out to over 21.5 million children.  Right from grassroots level &ndash; we are working tirelessly to develop a holistic sporting ecosystem in the country. An ecosystem that will scout, nurture, train, and develop future champions!  It is my dream to see our athletes excel at the pinnacle of global sport &ndash; The Olympics. It is also my dream to bring the Olympics to India.  I believe in our youth. And I have no doubt that if we encourage and empower them, they will make these dreams come true and make our country proud. Dear Shareholders,  For all of us at Reliance, the work of Reliance Foundation is a source of tremendous joy, pride, and fulfilment.  For us, the ability to make a difference &ndash; big or small &ndash; to touch someone's life for the better, is more precious than anything else.  Whenever India has faced any adversity, we Indians have always overcome it with absolute unity and determination.  This crisis will be&nbsp; no&nbsp; different. Together, we can and we will win this fight. And come out stronger as a nation.  Keep well. Keep safe. Jai Hind!  Thank you, Nita for highlighting how Reliance Foundation is a caring and compassionate institution always ready to serve the nation.  	Value Creation and Conclusion  Dear Shareowners,  Let&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; share&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliance's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; future&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation Roadmap. Our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani gave us a mantra that continues to guide us in our value creation journey. He said &ldquo;GROWTH IS LIFE&rdquo;, which we have adopted as our motto.  He also constantly reminded us that, for happiness, growth should be holistic, enriching the life of every Indian and developing every aspect of human life.  Walking in his footsteps, Reliance has constantly reinvented itself to pursue ever higher growth goals.  And with each new growth cycle, we have demonstrated our commitment to create more prosperity for India and benefit more Indians.  In&nbsp;&nbsp; 2020,&nbsp;&nbsp; we&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp; can&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; proud&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stands&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stronger&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ever&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before. This is because, as a Technology and Consumer Company, Reliance has built three Hyper-Growth Engines&hellip; Jio Platforms business.  Reliance Retail's New Commerce business. Reliance's O2C business.  In the years to come, Reliance will create more growth engines for accelerating its diversified growth.  Among them, as I have already mentioned, is our vision to make Reliance a New Energy and New Materials Company.  Our&nbsp;&nbsp; growth&nbsp;&nbsp; strategy&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; aimed&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; needs&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; billion&nbsp;&nbsp; Indians. Especially, the millions of under-privileged people, who are at the Bottom of the Economic and Social Pyramid. So far, India's growth has been sustained by the demands of a small part of our enviable demographic strength. But when 'Bharat' and 'India' start growing together, the whole world will be astonished.  When we create value for our nation's inclusive future, its automatic by-product is value accretion for Reliance.  Dear Shareowners,  We are well aware that we cannot realise this vision on our own. Indeed, no single company can.  Therefore, we are adopting a strategy of two Ps &ndash;  Partnerships with millions of small merchants, kisans, SMEs, teachers, healthcare workers, helping them become more productive and profitable.  Also, Partnerships with promising Indian start-ups and globally renowned technology and energy companies. Intellectual property is going to be an important pillar of our value creation journey.  Therefore, Reliance will continue to strengthen its in-house capabilities in cutting-edge technological innovations. Towards this end, we will work more aggressively to attract the best young Indian talent.  Reliance will work with other Indian companies, including start-ups, to vigorously promote &ldquo;Made-in-India&rdquo;, &ldquo;Made-for-India&rdquo; and &ldquo;Made-for-the-World&rdquo; products.  Dear Shareholders,  As Reliance grows bigger, we have demonstrated our ability to raise necessary investments to fire our growth engines.  Now, on the back of our robust balance sheet, and taking advantage of the favourable conditions in global debt markets, we shall confidently pursue all future growth opportunities across our businesses.  Our track record of value creation so far will itself open future tracks of investment on a sustainable basis.  Dear Shareholders,   Reliance has travelled three years into its Golden Decade. What an incredible journey it has been since our IPO in 1977. Our market capitalization has increased at a CAGR of 31%.  Reliance is now ranked among the World's 60 largest companies by market capitalization.  And when Reliance scales still higher summits of success, our employees and shareholders will surely reap its rewards.  Dear Shareholders,  Reliance's 50th&nbsp;anniversary in 2027 coincides with the 80th&nbsp;anniversary of India's Independence. This is not a coincidence.  It shows the intrinsic relationship between New Reliance and New India.  Today I want to solemnly pledge that we are ever more committed to maximising our contribution to solving the big problems facing our Nation and also our Planet.  Dear Friends,  Before I conclude, I must share my deepest emotion with you.  These are difficult times, no doubt, for India and the world because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, never have I felt more optimistic in my life about a bright future for India, and for Reliance.  When I interact with young entrepreneurs, engineers and innovators, both in Reliance and in other enterprises, I clearly see in them a level of ambition and self-confidence far higher than in people of my generation.  They surely are going to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;Indian&nbsp; Dream&nbsp;&nbsp;come true. They strengthen my conviction that INDIA'S TIME HAS WELLAND TRULY COME!  Our visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has rightly predicted that, beyond the hardships of the corona crisis, India will emerge as a stronger, more inclusively prosperous, more resilient and more self-confident nation.  Let us work together to realise this noble goal.  For all of us at Reliance, the source of inspiration is Swami Vivekananda, who said: &ldquo;Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.&rdquo;  In this mission to serve India and the world, we seek the blessings of all of you dear shareowners, of our Elders, and Lord Krishna.  	Acknowledgements  I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, lenders, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.  I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their oversight in this crucial phase of our growth, their support and immense encouragement.  I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly to create and sustain a world-class enterprise.  Thank you!

The stock gained 3.2 percent intraday and at 12:51 hours IST, it was quoting at Rs 1,956.05, up 2.06 percent on the BSE.  The stock has so far gained 128 percent from its March 23 low and remained the biggest gainer among Nifty50 stocks since then. It is the first company to cross Rs 12 lakh crore in market cap, thanks all to Jio and digital business.  &amp;quot;RIL's well-established connectivity business under Jio Platforms, formidable offline retail footprint under Reliance Retail, proposed foray in the digital commerce segment under JioMart and recent strategic partnership with Facebook, have propelled it to the forefront of consumer-facing digital ecosystem opportunity in India,&amp;quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities which retained buy rating on the stock, raising SoTP-based fair value to Rs 2,150 (from Rs 1,750 earlier).  Catch All Live Updates on Reliance's 43rd AGM Here  The brokerage believes RIL's ever-expanding portfolio of products and services to target the 4Cs of the digital ecosystem &mdash;connectivity, commerce, content and currency&mdash;will enable it to leverage the sizeable traffic across its consumer-facing verticals, generate new revenue streams and create significant value in the long run.  Reliance Industries has sold more than 25 percent stake in Jio Platforms since April 22, to global marquee investors. So far Facebook, the owner of Whatsapp, is the biggest shareholder in Jio Platforms after Reliance Industries, acquired 9.99 percent stake for Rs 43,574 crore.  Kotak valued the overall retail business at an enterprise value of $62 billion.  &amp;quot;(1) ascribing 25X EV/EBITDA multiple to core retail segment versus 20X earlier and (2) factoring incremental contribution of $17 billion (around Rs 1.3 lakh crore) from the digital commerce business based on probability-weighted scenarios that may evolve for e-commerce in India by FY30. (1) RIL's proven track record of execution, (2) large customer base of Jio and retail segments, (3) strategic tie-up with WhatsApp, (4) unmatched portfolio of private labels and exclusive brand tie-ups, (5) India&rsquo;s domestic-centric policies and (6) possible inorganic ventures, will enable the company to overcome the head-start achieved by other e-commerce players,&amp;quot; it reasoned.  Its analysis of the overall retail business opportunity suggests that Reliance Retail can potentially double its revenues to over $26 billion from core segments in next four years, while achieving an incremental gross merchandise value (GMV) of $12 billion from its foray in India's e-commerce market, which is all set to treble to $100 billion by FY25.  Kotak feels progress on digital commerce business, monetization of incremental ecosystem opportunities, increase in telecom tariffs and recovery in O2C business environment are the key catalysts to watch out for.  Potential closure of transactions related to O2C and fiber-InvIT, and further strategic partnerships in digital services and retail business can be positive triggers as well, according to the brokerage.

The collective wealth of India&rsquo;s billionaires, according to the Forbes World Billionaires 2020 List, contracted 22.8 percent to $312.6 billion from $405.3 billion a year earlier. Forbes calculated net worth based on stock prices and exchange rates as on March 18.  Reliance Industries&rsquo; (RIL) owner Mukesh Ambani continued to hold his position as India&rsquo;s richest, but saw his wealth fall by over 25 percent to $36.8 billion, from $50 billion last year due to stock market collapses and global oil fluctuations. (RIL is the owner of Network 18, publisher of Forbes India.)  However, Ambani has since stormed back into the top 10 of the&nbsp;Forbes real-time Billionaires Index (as of June 26), on the back of 11 large investments into its telecom subsidiary Jio Platforms, which has led to a surge in the RIL stock price and helped make it debt-free.  At least 15 billionaires from the list have seen a growth in net worth from last year. Radhakishan Damani jumped to become the second richest Indian billionaire from seventh in 2019 (net worth up by 24 percent to $13.8 billion), through his Avenue Supermarts which owns and operates the DMart chain of hypermarkets.  Other gainers include Sunil Mittal, whose net worth rose by 35 percent to $8.8 billion in the list, as its telecom service Bharti Airtel has emerged a force to reckon with. Industrialist Gautam Adani, who leads the diversified Adani Group, food and beverages tycoon Ravi Jaipuria and Shree Cement founder Benu Gopal Bangur also gained in net worth from the previous year.  Once math tutor and now entrepreneur Byju Raveendran (in picture) debuts on the list (53rd richest Indian and ranked 1,196) on the back of sharp growth of his edtech unicorn Byju&rsquo;s. According to the list, the company is valued at $8 billion and Raveendran, India&rsquo;s youngest billionaire at 38, at $1.8 billion. (In June-end, Byju&rsquo;s raised about $100 million from Silicon Valley investor Bond Capital, sending its valuation soaring at around $10.5 billion.)  The net worth of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, India&rsquo;s second richest billionaire as per the 2019 list, has fallen 73 percent to $6.1 billion and rank to tenth, as he has been giving away most of his wealth to his charity foundation.  The number of India&rsquo;s dollar billionaires in the list fell by four to 102, which included Ambani&rsquo;s younger brother Anil (75th Indian and 1,349 on the 2019 list). Anil Ambani has seen his businesses crumble, with RCom filing for bankruptcy last year. Media tycoon Subhash Chandra (51st Indian and 916 in 2019) has also fallen off due to debts.  For some, stock market fortunes and business cycles continue to be harsh. Former Yes Bank shareholders Rana Kapoor and Madhu Kapur; Tarang Jain, owner of auto-part maker Varroc, and Max Group&rsquo;s chairman Analjit Singh, who had dropped out in 2019, have not climbed back onto the list. The current fiscal is bound to throw up more unpleasant news. The impact of COVID-19 has only worsened since the list was published and it will hurt valuations of companies more in the coming quarters.

A committee of directors of the firm today approved a massive fund raising exercise of up to Rs 14,000 crore in one or more tranches through a combination of financial instruments.  Earlier this week, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported about the mega fundraising plans of the Deepak Parekh-led housing finance powerhouse. The report had said HDFC Ltd &nbsp;was looking to raise &nbsp;around Rs 12,000 crore in multiple tranches via a combination of a QIP and an NCD (non-convertible debenture ) + warrant or FCCB ( foreign currency convertible bond route) .  It had added that the firm wanted to boost its capital buffers due to the uncertainty caused post the outbreak of COVID-19 and potential concerns on asset quality.  The fundraising could be carried out in one or more tranches via issuance of equity shares or compulsorily convertible debentures, non-convertible debentures along with warrants, foreign currency convertible bonds either through a qualified institutional placement or other permissible modes, the company said in its official statement today.  The HDFC statement added that the said funds are being raised to augment its long term resources , finance organic &amp;amp;amp; inorganic business opportunities that may arise in financial services including housing finance and /or in areas where its subsidiaries operate, and to maintain sufficient liquidity and for general corporate purposes.  The company reported a standalone profit of Rs 2,232.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, declining 22 percent due to higher provisions related to COVID-19 and high base last year. Provisions (expected credit loss) increased significantly to Rs 1,274 crore for the quarter ended March 2020 which included the impact of COVID-19, against Rs 398 crore in March quarter 2019.  HDFC said it has made provisions of Rs 10,988 crore as of March 31. This is Rs 6,800 crore over and above the regulatory requirement.&nbsp;To be sure, HDFC Ltd has a capital adequacy of 17.7 percent (of which 16.6 percent is tier one capital), which is one of the highest in the financial sector in India.  The gross non-performing loans as of March 31, 2020, stood at Rs 8,908 crore. This is equivalent to 1.99 per cent of the loan portfolio. The non-performing loans of the individual portfolio stood at 0.95 per cent while that of the non-individual portfolio stood at 4.71 percent."

Here is what PVR Ltd, the nation&rsquo;s largest operator of multi-screen theatres, has to say.  &ldquo;Since all cinemas are shut, the company is not generating any revenue from operations while we continue to incur committed cash outflows, including salary payouts, overheads as well as payments for older working capital,&rdquo; it said in a communication to the stock exchanges on June 8.  Aditya Birla Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Retail is another example. The company has seen a dramatic drop in footfalls at stores and plunging sales from the second week of March.  &ldquo;Eventually, it had to shut down its entire retail network through the month in line with the nationwide lockdown. This had an adverse impact on the quarterly performance,&rdquo; the company said on May 27.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Ajay Tyagi and team is aware of the woes of the smaller players and has taken several steps to help the companies.  Sebi has relaxed the fund-raising norms by amending the Takeover Code and the ICDR ( Issue of Capital &amp;amp;amp; Disclosure ) Regulations. The new rules were notified on June 16.  In the last few months, Sebi had already taken a few other steps like extending the approval validity for launching IPOs by six months, relaxing the norms for changing the size of fresh issues, widening the eligibility for companies to fast-track rights issues, slashing broker turnover fees and filing charges for issuers, and directing listed companies to disclose the impact of COVID-19 on their operations.  Subsequently, the Ajay Bijli-promoted PVR approved a Rs 300 crore-rights issue while bracing for a &ldquo;significant negative impact on profitability and liquidity during lockdown and even thereafter till business comes to normalcy.&rdquo; Aditya Birla Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Retail is also planning a rights issue.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    WILL THE TWEAKS TO THE TAKEOVER CODE ENTHUSE PROMOTERS?  The changes to the takeover code will now allow promoters to acquire up to 10 per cent in their firms (as compared to 5 per cent earlier, referred to as a creeping acquisition) in a financial year without an open offer.  Promoters, however, can do that only through a preferential issue of shares and after pumping in fresh capital.&nbsp;A preferential issue is a sale of shares by a firm to a select group of investors, and is considered one of the swiftest ways to raise capital.  The move is valid till March 31, 2021.  Sandip Bhagat, partner at law firm S&amp;amp;amp;R Associates, says it&rsquo;s a welcome move as it would offer promoters more flexibility and help listed companies to raise fresh funds from promoters in these tough times. This step is also a breather to companies which were finding it difficult to access debt financing and equity financing.  But the jury is out on whether the limited relaxation of an additional 5 per cent would be sufficient for companies.  &ldquo;The doubling of head room for creeping acquisition, solely for promoters and solely for the infusion of fresh money into the company seems like a nudge to enable money being invested into business instead of being spent on buying shares,&rdquo; says securities law expert and advocate Somasekhar Sundaresan.  In the current environment, businesses are looking at shareholders to tap fund-raising avenues and create adequate liquidity buffers.  &ldquo;Promoters with deep pockets could bring in funds and ensure cash flow in trying times like now. It&rsquo;s the first attempt at a fixed-term provision with a sunset clause just for this financial year. It would be interesting to see if it is put to use,&rdquo; Sundaresan adds.  Many corporates have warmed up to rights issues (issue of shares at a special price for existing shareholders) in recent months, which have seen promoters lapping up residual or renounced shares.  Even private equity firms are focusing more on the operations of their portfolio firms.  &ldquo;While rights issue was one avenue, one limitation for listed companies was the inability to raise capital from promoters in excess of 5 per cent in a financial year without a mandatory open offer for another 26 per cent.&nbsp; SEBI has been intelligent enough to help companies by making this relaxation,&rdquo; says Aakash Choubey, Partner, Khaitan &amp;amp;amp; Co.  THE PRICING FACTOR  Pricing is always an important criterion for such equity issues, but this time Sebi has left the pricing norms for preferential allotment unchanged. Choubey wonders if the move would be enough to help companies deal with liquidity issues. Since there is no relaxation on floor pricing, companies may find it an expensive option.  Unlike rights issue, preferential issues are carried out via a SEBI- approved formula at an average price of the last two weeks or past 26 weeks, whichever is higher. In the COVID-19 era, there is a substantial gap between the current market price and the price arrived at by using the Sebi formula, making it really tough for firms.  As part of the June 16 amendment, Sebi has also relaxed the provision for voluntary open offers by temporarily removing a disqualification condition.  Earlier, a shareholder with 25 per cent or more shares or voting rights was permitted to make a voluntary open offer, but only if he had not acquired any shares of the company via the creeping acquisition route in the preceding 52 weeks.  That condition has now been relaxed till March 31, 2021, giving a fresh option to promoters to consolidate their holdings, but less than the overall public shareholding threshold of 75 per cent.  REDUCING THE QIP COOLING-OFF PERIOD  As part of the changes notified on June 16, the market regulator also substantially reduced the mandatory gap between back-to-back qualified institutional placements or QIPs by a listed firm to two weeks. Earlier, firms were required to maintain a gap of six months between two QIPs.  Will this help?  &ldquo;Possibly -- for those firms that need money in quick succession,&rdquo; feels Bhagat. Capital market experts believe the move will help corporates time their fund-raising plans better and give them greater flexibility to launch share sales based on share price movement.  But then there are those who wonder if issuers can execute deals so quickly today and if risk-averse investors would be comfortable with such short gaps.  Fund-raising conditions are not ideal for firms outside the heavyweight category. &ldquo;In the current unprecedented situation, investors will prefer to seek safety in established businesses. All over the world, big is becoming bigger. In such a scenario, investors will prefer to be with leaders, which, by definition, are large-cap companies,&rdquo; says Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC.  Interestingly, since 2009, even with a gap of nine months between subsequent QIPs, only four placements emerge, according to Prime Database. The list includes Unitech Ltd and 3i Infotech in 2009, Mannapuram General Finance &amp;amp;amp; Leasing in 2010 and Dhanalaxmi Bank in 2013. Unitech had the shortest gap of 71 days.   (Source: PRIME Database)  Between March 25, 2020 (the beginning of the nationwide lockdown) and June 3, 2020, Indian companies raised Rs 7,443 crore via the QIP route, which represents a 135 per cent &nbsp;increase, compared to the same period last year.  FY 2019-20 was an active period for the QIP route, with corporates raising Rs 51,216 crore from 13 QIPs. In FY 18-19, Rs 10,489 crore was raised from the same number of QIPs. &nbsp;Both QIPs and preferential issues require shareholder approval via a special resolution.  The path has been set for a smooth sail for the small-cap and mid-cap companies. But are these measures enough and are more required? The markets will provide the clue in the coming days."

The company said it has become completely net debt-free and has raised over Rs 1.68 lakh crore in just 58 days, hinting that it will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world.  Stock market expert SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18 that the stock of Reliance Industries may see a big re-rating. He has a target of Rs 1,900 on the stock, which Tulsian believes, it can achieve by March 2021.  Tulsian sees retail as the next growth driver for Reliance.  &amp;quot;The company's first goal of being debt-free has been achieved and now he does not see any further dilution in Jio Platform. The next growth area will be Reliance Retail,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;quot;If you compare Reliance Retail with DMart, having a market capitalisation of 1.5 lakh crore with the topline of 25,000 crore, Reliance Retail has a topline of about 2 lakh crore. So, it is about 7 times the size of the topline. I guess the valuation of Reliance Retail can be between 4-5 lakh crore,&amp;quot; Tulsian said.  &amp;quot;Probably the process of the induction of strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail will happen like in Jio Platform,&amp;quot; said Tulsian.  Tulsian said Jio may not see Indian listing as it will not be able to capture full value of the stock.  Jio may see an overseas listing in the next couple of years to give maximum value to the Reliance shareholders. Because if Jio is listed on Indian bourses, then the discounting of the holding company will start and Reliance Industries may not capture the true value. But if the Jio Platform is listed overseas then the holding company can capture the full value.  The oil-to-telecom behemoth, Reliance Industries on June 19 said it has raised over Rs 1,68,818 crore in just 58 days through the investments by global tech investors (Rs 1,15,693.95 crore) and rights issue (Rs 53,124.20 crore).

With these investments, RIL has become net debt-free,&amp;quot; said the company.  &amp;quot;The combined capital raised has no precedence globally in such a short time. Both of these are also unprecedented in Indian corporate history and have set new benchmarks. This is even more remarkable that this was achieved amidst a global lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,&amp;quot; the company said in a media release.  Jio platforms has raised Rs 1,15,693.95 crore from leading global investors including Facebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, L Catterton and PIF since April 22, 2020.

Jio, which runs movie, news and music apps as well as the telecom enterprise Jio Infocomm,&nbsp;has attracted the largest continuous fundraising by a company anywhere in the world.  The investment by PIF, estimated to own combined assets of nearly $400 billion, in Jio&nbsp;Platforms is&nbsp;at an equity valuation of Rs 4.91 lakh crore and an enterprise valuation of Rs 5.16 lakh crore.

What about the allotment? What should be the next strategy? Should we hold or sell?  First of all, partly paid-up rights issue shareholders should thoroughly track the underlying shares of Reliance Industries, which was trading at Rs 1,572 as on June 10. The next strategy should be discovering the price of partially paid-up rights issue.  Take into consideration the closing price of Rs 1,572. Now, we have to find out the listing price of partly paid-up share by subtracting, (CMP &ndash; remaining dues), which comes out to Rs 942.75.  Rs 314.25 has to be paid by May 2021 and remaining Rs 628.50 by November 2021.  Now, the present value of Rs 942.75, on a risk-free return of 6 percent, comes to around Rs 875 (round off). Hence, on current CMP of Rs 1,572, the listing price should be Rs 697 (1,572-875).  To hold or sell on listing day?  Those who get a direct advantage of the rights issue through holding generally are long-term investors. Therefore, they can opt to &ldquo;retain&rdquo; with a long-term view.  Those who bought Rights Entitlement (RE) from the secondary market or have a short-term outlook are expected to get a very handsome return on investment (ROI) on current market price considering an investment amount of around Rs 525-535 (Rs 314.25 paid up amount plus Rs 210-220 RE value). As a result, the investor can easily generate expected ROI of 30-35 percent in just a month. Hence, we recommend that &ldquo;sell&rdquo; on listing day would be a better option for short-term investors.  Note: Rs 1,572 is an example of the current market price. It is better to take a decision on basis of the closing price of the day before the listing.  What to track?  Reliance has already sold stake worth Rs 97,885.65 crore in Jio Platforms to global investors. This would help the digital platform to grow and deleverage the balance sheet.  In addition, the company is progressing well with Saudi Aramco to sell a 20 percent stake in oil-to-chemicals business, which would significantly add net cash and make it financially stronger.  In the retail business, the closure of stores and malls has lead to lower footfalls. However, we expect this will scale up rapidly led by JioMart and pharmacy platform. Hence, overall our outlook is positive for the company in the long run.  (The author is Senior Research Analyst at Rudra Shares &amp;amp;amp; Stock Brokers Ltd.)

Here is what to watch out for next with respect to mega rights issue:  1&amp;amp;gt; Basis of Allotment: The company will finalize the basis of allotment of rights issue shares on or about June 10, 2020.  a&amp;amp;gt; Full allotment will be made to those eligible equity shareholders who have applied for their Rights Entitlements of rights equity shares either in full or in part and also to the renouncee(s) who has or have applied for rights equity shares renounced in their favour, in full or in part.  b&amp;amp;gt; Eligible equity shareholders whose fractional entitlements are being ignored and eligible equity shareholders with zero entitlement, would be given preference in allotment of one additional Rights equity share each if they apply for additional rights equity shares. Allotment for these shareholders will be considered if there are any unsubscribed rights equity shares after allotment under (a) above.  c&amp;amp;gt; In case of application for additional rights equity shares by eligible equity shareholders, allotment will be at the sole discretion of the board in consultation with the Designated Stock Exchange.  d&amp;amp;gt; In case of application for additional rights equity shares by renouncees, allotment will be made if there is surplus available after making full allotment to eligible equity shareholders.  2&amp;amp;gt; Transfer of Rights issue shares: The Rights equity shares will be credited to the demat account of eligible shareholders and renouncees on or about June 11.  3&amp;amp;gt; Refund: In case of non-allotment or partial allotment, surplus application money will be refunded to the investor after finalization of basis of allotment in consultation with Designated Stock Exchange.  4&amp;amp;gt; Listing of Partly Paid Up Rights issue shares: The rights shares credited to shareholders are called partly paid-up rights shares as shareholders made only part payment (first instalment of Rs 314.25 out of total issue price of Rs 1,257 per share) against these shares. These shares will be separately listed on bourses on June 12 with a separate ISIN ID.  The closing price before listing these shares would be intrinsic value + first instalment (Rs 314.25). Intrinsic value is the difference between rights issue price (Rs 1,257) and Reliance Industries current market price (June 11th's closing price).  5&amp;amp;gt; Second Instalment Due: Eligible shareholders will have to make a payment of second instalment of Rs 314.25 in May 2021. The company will inform the relevant date for the same. These partly paid up rights shares will continue trading under separate ISIN and on ex-date (which will be decided company later) the second instalment of Rs 314.25 will be added in partly paid-up rights share price.  6&amp;amp;gt; Third Instalment Due: The balance payment or last instalment of Rs 628.50 will be paid in November 2021.  7&amp;amp;gt; Merger with Existing Reliance Shares: On payment of the final call (last instalment) in respect of the partly paid-up rights equity shares, such partly paid-up rights equity shares would be converted into fully paid-up equity shares which will be merged with existing fully paid-up equity shares of Reliance Industries and listed under the existing ISIN of Reliance Industries.

The investment by Mubadala, which manages about $229 billion in assets, at an equity value of Rs 4.91 lakh crore and an enterprise value of Rs 5.16 lakh crore takes the total amount raised by Jio to an eye-popping Rs 87,655.35 crore, according to a statement by RIL.  Jio Platforms, which runs movie, news and music apps as well as the telecom enterprise Jio Infocomm, has now sold a combined stake of 18.97 percent in six massive fundraising deals.  The series of deals was led by Facebook Inc, which invested Rs 43,574 crore to buy 9.99 percent on April 22.&nbsp; Since then, General Atlantic, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners and KKR together spent Rs 78,562 crore on Jio.  Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries (RIL), said he was delighted that Mubadala, one of the most astute and transformational global growth investors, has decided to partner his company in its journey to propel India&rsquo;s digital growth towards becoming a leading digyal nation in the world. &ldquo;Through my longstanding ties with Abu Dhabi, I have personally seen the impact of Mubadala&rsquo;s work in diversifying and globally connecting the UAE&rsquo;s knowledge-based economy.

Mubadala typically makes investments in enterprises that create lasting value and positive economic and social impact in communities at home and overseas, according to its website. Its portfolio companies are spread in sectors such as aerospace, agribusiness, ICT, semiconductors, metals and mining, pharmaceutical and medical technology, renewable energy and utilities.

The ranking was done by Brand Finance India, in its&nbsp;latest 2020 report.  Coming at the top was Tata Steel, also the largest Indian steelmaker. Its brand value went up by 16 percent to $1.3 billion, from $1.16 billion last year. Vedanta came in second, with its brand value increasing by 10.5 percent to $786 million.

Reliance Industries was among the biggest gainers, with its brand value up 25 percent.  Trying times  Despite Tata Steel's top billing in the metals and mining sector, the company has been facing headwinds, both in its domestic and European businesses.  The European arm has been facing a crisis, with workers in the Netherlands plant protesting the exit of a top official. Reports say that the company may be forced to break-up its European operations, and separate the UK business from the Netherlands one.

Justice Mukta Gupta, in two separate interim orders, said RIL and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have made out a prima facie case in their favour and in case no ad-interim injunction is granted they would suffer an irreparable loss and balance of convenience also lies in their favour.  The high court passed the orders Thursday on two suits by RIL saying they are the owners of trademarks and trade names JIO and RELIANCE, with its variations in number of classes and defendants OLX India BV and OLX India Pvt Ltd and Quikr India Pvt Ltd are causing immense harm and irreparable injury to their goodwill and reputation.  The web portals are engaged in publishing classified advertisements and they enable consumers to publish advertisements for selling and offering goods and services for a consideration.  The lawsuits said fake and fraudulent recruitment advertisements were being published on the defendants' web portals which are accessible under various words like &ldquo;JIO JOBS, RELIANCE TRENDS JOBS&rdquo; and this infringes the plaintiffs' trademark and trade name JIO and RELIANCE.  It said their trademark was being used and a number of innocent job seekers are duped and money is being extorted from them.  The lawsuit against Quikr said that the web portal also operates as an online recruitment website facilitating consumers to advertise job vacancies.  It said that the defendant categorises its customers who are job seekers into three different categories such as &lsquo;Gold', &lsquo;Rapid Hire' and &lsquo;Spot Light' thereby charging its customers on the basis of facilities which they would be able to avail from this portal.  The counsel for OLX India submitted before the high court that they have removed some of the URLs and due to technical reasons, one URL could not be removed and they are in the process of doing it.  They further said they have also added filters with the words &lsquo;JIO and RELIANCE' so that in future nobody can misuse their platform with these false and fictitious advertisements so as to defraud the job seekers and infringe the plaintiffs' trademarks or trade names.  The counsel for Quikr India said the listings on its portal are automatic and in view of the large number of people listing their advertisements on the web portal and the system being auto generated, the web portal has no mechanism to ascertain the authenticity of the third parties.  The counsel said as and when any party lodges a complaint, the defendant pulls down the concerned URL and in this case on being informed that these two URLs are fake, it would immediately pull them down.  The high court, in its order passed in Quikr case, said &ldquo;Consequently, till the next date of hearing, defendant, its agents, servants, affiliates are also restrained from putting on their portal any advertisement containing the name/mark JIO and RELIANCE with its variations and/or any other mark, logo which is deceptively/confusingly similar to the plaintiffs' registered trademarks JIO and RELIANCE in terms of prayer&hellip;&rdquo;  The high court also issued summons to OLX India and Quikr India on the lawsuits and listed the matter for further hearing on September 21.

To subscribe to the issue, an upfront payment of 25 percent could be done and for the remaining amount payment to be done in tranches of 25 percent in May 2021 and balance 50 percent to be paid in November 2021.  Taking example of 1 share held, the shareholder needs to pay: 1) 25 percent upfront which is Rs 314.25 2) 25 percent in May 2021 - Rs 314.25 3) 50 percent in November 2021 - Rs 628.50  The entitlement is being credited to the demat account of the shareholder. Rights holders will be able to trade their entitlement on a separate window which is RIL-RE on exchanges till May 29 2020 where shareholders can sell and renounce their entitlement.  Leverage Benefit  As only 25 percent of the payment being made upfront, buyer can be saved and avail the benefit of leverage by paying the installments after one year.  For instance, if an investor thinks that Reliance will appreciate by 20 percent in next 1 year then the difference of leverage is given below:-  Reliance Industries current market price is Rs 1,440  A) If one investor bought 1 share from stock exchange at Rs 1,440 and suppose it is appreciated by Rs 288 (20 percent) in next one year then the return on investment (RoI) will be 20 percent.  B) Another investor bought Reliance entitlement at Rs 232 and paid upfront payment of 25 percent which is Rs 314.25. On total, he paid Rs 546.25 whereas he is also getting the whole benefit of appreciation which is around Rs 288 (as stated above). In such case, his RoI is boosted to 52.72 percent which is almost thrice in comparison to the first case (A).  Trading of these Rights Entitlement (RE) will be allowed only till May 29, which is being monitored by SEBI.  Discovery of RE price  If we calculate the fair value of RE, which should be paid by the buyer to seller is around Rs 175.  For applying to the rights issue, investor should get the benefit of Rs 183 (difference between closing price of RIL as on May 21st &amp;amp;amp; Rights issue price). At the time of the discovery price first we will take 25 percent of the difference which is around Rs 46 (because buyer has to pay 25 percent as upfront payment). But it is not true because seller will lose the remaining Rs 137 which he could gain by next year. Hence, we will value this Rs 137 by time value factor of 1 year, discounted at 6 percent (risk-free return).  The present value comes at around Rs 129 and the fair value of RE turns into Rs 175 (129+46).  Thus, the main reason of RE trading in premium from their discovery price is to get the leverage benefit by the investors.  What should you do?  In case you want to invest in RIL, so instead of investing in Reliance Industries share, one should go for RIL-RE as the immediate benefit of leverage can be availed and Reliance has so much of hidden value which could be seen in their share price in coming years.

Refiners processed about 14.75 million tonnes or 3.60 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil last month, government data showed.  The lockdown and travel curbs aimed at stemming spread of COVID-19 since March 25 forced people to stay home, cutting India's fuel demand by 45.8 percent in April.  Falling demand led Indian refiners and gas importers to declare force majeure on imports.  Refiners, struggling to store oil and products, had to sell some oil to the federal government which used it to fill strategic storage.  India has extended its nationwide restrictions to May 31, but relaxed rules in areas with lower numbers of cases leading to some recovery in fuel demand and refiner runs this month.  Indian refiners operated at about 72 percent of their overall capacity of about 5 million bpd, the data showed.  Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, operated its plant at about 53 percent capacity, while use at the refineries owned by its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum plunged to about 33 percent of capacity, the data showed.  Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, operated its export-focussed 700,000 bpd Jamnagar refinery at about 87 percent capacity.  Nayara Energy, part owned by Russia's Rosneft, curtailed runs at its 400,000 bpd Vadinar refinery to 85 percent of capacity.

This Rights Issue looks and is also similar to most rights issues opened in the past for various companies except one thing which has set this issue apart from others in past.  Yes, from this current Reliance Rights Issue we have been experiencing a historical first trading of Rights Entitlements through exchange mechanism which was also happening earlier but only in offline market and with physical form mostly.  This new introduction has opened opportunity for many retail investors to either participate in the rights issue like normally and also sell their eligible/entitled portion of shares to other willing investors who may have missed the opportunity due to lapse of record date or want to bid for higher number of shares than originally entitled ration of one rights share for every fifteen equity shares of Reliance Industries.  Not only this, the current mechanism has also opened up various opportunities for arbitrage seeking players who could benefit from the momentary mispricing between rights issue and fully paid up equity shares. Hence providing both depth and liquidity in the markets during the process.  Now without taking much time, let's look what are the details of this offer and what kind of opportunities are or could arise out of the present situation.  Firstly, let us see the details of the offer briefly below;    So, above is the snapshot of the rights issue offer presently on offer by Reliance Industries which the shareholders can apply through provided mechanism detailed by the company.  Now coming to the new exchange traded entitlement mechanism which has been effected from this and hopefully continue to forthcoming issues as well. Let us understand how this works.  Exchange Traded Entitlement Mechanism:  The exchange traded entitlement (Rights Entitlement) which has been effective as mentioned in below table is basically a mechanism where the participants who want to subscribe for more than the allotted shares in the rights issue can buy such rights entitlements from the exchange window and become eligible for the application and similarly vice versa.    Now, with this the new mechanism an opportunity arises for both the normal shareholders as well as the arbitragers who could gain whenever mispricing is available in the markets. But before detailing that, let us first simply understand what is the actual value of rights issue since, it is not paid in full on June 3, 2020 but in three instalments over eighteen months timeline.    In the above table we have calculated a simple present value of the payments any person is going to make to subscribe to the rights issue. As already known that payments are scheduled in three parts over next eighteen months hence an investor is just paying only 25 percent of the amount initially and remaining amount is paid over eighteen months. Hence, this remaining amount is available to an investor in cash to earn either interest if deposited in banks or earn capital gains if invested in markets.  Thus, we have assumed two scenarios wherein we assume that an investor could earn 10 percent or 6 percent of the remaining 75 percent of amount till he is called in to pay these instalments by the company. So in this case we have discounted back the instalments with these assumed rates and calculated that the estimated present value of the rights issue which is available at Rs 1,257 per rights share at 10 percent discount rate is Rs 1,141 and at 6 percent discount rate is Rs 1,184.  Now in below table we see how to calculate the value of rights renunciation (Rights Entitlement), in this case RIL-RE which is currently trading in exchanges.    There are two aspects namely fixed and variable while pricing rights renunciation as mentioned in above table. The fixed aspect is arrived by deducting present value calculated from rights price of Rs 1,257 which in this case is Rs 115.8 at 10 percent discount rate and Rs 72.64 at 6 percent discount rate, since the rights price is fixed hence it is called fixed component.  To arrive at the variable component we have to take into account the difference between current prices of the Reliance Industries fully paid equity shares and rights price and then add it to the previous fixed component. In this case it is Rs 184.25 and because the CMP of Reliance changes daily hence this difference is dynamic and called as variable component.  Thus, the value of rights renunciation (RE) should theoretically be about Rs 300 at 10 percent and Rs 257 at 6 percent discount rates, respectively.  Execution aspects of the trade:  As we have arrived at the present value and estimated the value at which Reliance RE units should trade and also similarly after the allotment of rights share the rights share should also trade with similar values while adding the paid amount to the already calculated RIL-RE values.  However, as an investor or a trader let's look at various execution strategies one could do to benefit out of this mechanism.  1.&amp;amp;gt; Buying Rights Entitlement units: Any investor who wants to have an exposure in Reliance equity shares can instead subscribe for rights issue by simply buying the Reliance Industries - Rights entitlement units (RIL-RE) from exchanges at prices lower than his/her discounted rates as shown in above examples and could earn some additional returns over and above the return given by the underlying Reliance shares. Table below shows relationship between discount rate, RIL-RE price and expected return an investor could generate.    2.&amp;amp;gt; Selling Existing shares and buying same through RIL-RE mechanism: Any investor who already has invested in the fully paid Reliance shares have an opportunity to lower their cost of acquisition by executing below mentioned trades. As seen in the table below an existing share can lower his acquisition cost by this strategy. And also enjoys an additional liquidity of Rs 893.4 per share for the next one year as second instalment is due not before May-2021 and can generate additional returns from this amount by investing in any asset class of his/her choice.  The overall risk profile to the trade is similar as was before which is exposure to Reliance Industries equity and its price movements.

The credit rating agency comment on a day when Reliance announced sale of 2.32 percent stake in Jio Platforms to global investment firm KKR &amp;amp;amp; Co. Inc for Rs 11,367 crore -- the fifth deal in four weeks that will inject a combined Rs 78,562 crore in the oil-to-telecom conglomerate to help it pare debt.  &amp;quot;Proceeds from these divestments alone will help the company pare around 49 percent of its net debt of Rs 1.61 lakh crore outstanding as of March 31, 2020,&amp;quot; Moody's said in an issuer note.  Exactly a month back, Facebook picked up 9.99 percent stake in the firm that houses India's youngest but largest telecom company for Rs 43,574 crore.  Within days of that deal, Silver Lake -- the world's largest tech investor -- bought 1.15 percent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 5,665.75 crore.  On May 8, US-based Vista Equity Partners bought 2.32 percent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 11,367 crore and on May 17 global equity firm General Atlantic picked up 1.34 percent stake for Rs 6,598.38 crore.  &amp;quot;These divestments are credit positive because proceeds from sales of the stakes will be used for debt reduction and bring the company closer to its target of reducing its net debt to zero by March 2021,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  All the transactions are currently underway and subject to regulatory and other approvals.  &amp;quot;Successful completion of the transactions will help to alleviate the negative impact of lower earnings caused by disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak,&amp;quot; it added.  The rating agency expects a 16-17 percent drop in Reliance's consolidated EBITDA for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, compared to fiscal 2020.  While EBITDA for the company's digital services segment will continue to grow during the coronavirus outbreak, it expects EBITDA for the refining and petrochemical segments to be weaker as a standstill in global travel and slowdown in economic activity will weaken the demand for transportation fuel and petrochemicals.  &amp;quot;As a result, we expect RIL's leverage, as measured by adjusted net debt/EBITDA, to remain appropriately positioned for its current rating,&amp;quot; it said.  Other steps taken by the company to reduce its net debt to zero include the partial divestment of its oil-to-chemical business (USD 15 billion) and fuel retailing business (USD 1 billion) to Saudi Aramco and BP Plc, respectively.  In addition, Reliance hanced a rights issue offering to raise around Rs 53,215 crore and use the proceeds toward debt reduction, it added.

The company said the proposed rights issuance will be the first by RIL in three decades. This rights issue is a part of the company's deleveraging plan and as a result, the company will be net debt free by March 31, 2021.  Reliance Industries has already garnered Rs 67,195 crore through stake sale in Jio Platforms in four weeks ahead of its rights issue.  Reliance Industries sold a total of 14.81 percent stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, Jio Platforms, to three private equity investors - Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners and General Atlantic&nbsp;- and Facebook Inc.  Facebook deal was the biggest as Jio raised Rs 43,574 crore by selling 9.99 percent stake to the WhatsApp owner.  Here are the five most important things that investors must know about the Reliance rights issue:  Opening and Closing Dates  The subscription for rights issue will open on May 20 and the closing date is June 3, 2020.  Rights Issue Size  Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries' rights issue size is Rs 53,125 crore and it will issue 42,26,26,894 equity shares.  Issue Price  India's biggest ever right issue has been priced at Rs 1,257 per share which had ex-right date at May 13, 2020.  Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities feels rights issue is fairly priced. &amp;quot;As against the last closing price of RIL shares of Rs 1,458.90 on May 15, the rights issue price of Rs 1,257 apiece is decently attractive, with a discount of 16 percent.  Rights Issue Ratio  The rights entitlement ratio is 1 equity share for every 15 equity shares held by eligible shareholders as on the record date which was May 14  Terms of Payment of Issue Price  The terms of payment will be 25 percent on application and balance in one or more calls as may be decided by the board of directors from time to time.  At the time of application, shareholders will pay Rs 314.25 per rights equity share (face value Rs 2.50 + premium Rs 311.75), and the balance amount of Rs 942.75 will be payable in one or more subsequent calls as determined by the board of directors, from time to time.  Accordingly, the company proposed the schedule for payment of the balance amount of Rs 942.75 per rights equity share. Shareholders can pay Rs 314.25 i.e. 25 percent in May 2021; and Rs 628.50 i.e. the balance 50 percent in November 2021.  Promoters Commitment  Promoter and promoter group with 50.07 percent stake have pledged to buy the full extent of their entitlement and also subscribe to all unsold shares in the rights issue, which shows the promoters commitment and confidence in the company's future growth prospects, Tapse said.  Objects of the Issue  The reason to come out with rights issue to existing shareholder is to pare down the company's debt which over the years has piled up through expansion of its retail and telecom arm and make company a net debt free by March 31, 2021.  Part of Capital Raising Programme  The company is expected to complete the capital raising programme totaling over Rs 1.04 Lakh crore by Q1 of the current financial year. This includes the investment by Facebook in Jio Platforms (already garnered Rs 43,574 crore), the upcoming rights issue and the previous investment by British Petroleum in FY2019-20.  Opportunity for Investors  &amp;quot;Existing investor can look this offer as opportunity which gives shareholder to be part of the company's growth prospects in new and emerging domains including retail, telecom and digital avenues,&amp;quot; Tapse told Moneycontrol.

Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said he was thrilled to welcome General Atlantic, a marquee global investor, as a valued partner. }I have known General Atlantic for several decades and greatly admired it for its belief in India&rsquo;s huge growth potential. General Atlantic shares our vision of a Digital Society for India and strongly believes in the transformative power of digitization in enriching the lives of 1.3 billion Indians.

We share Mukesh&rsquo;s conviction that digital connectivity has the potential to significantly accelerate the Indian economy and drive growth across the country. General Atlantic has a long track record working alongside founders to scale disruptive businesses, as Jio is doing at the forefront of the digital revolution in India.&rdquo;  The fourth investment by a marquee investor is also an endorsement of Jio&rsquo;s tech capabilities and the potential of the business model in this COVID-19 world and beyond. It reemphasises Jio&rsquo;s continuing attraction among global investors for its deep understanding of the Indian markets, the rapid digitisation opportunity post-COVID and its capabilities to bring cutting-edge technologies and tools such as AI, blockchain, AR/VR, Big Data into play for all Indians.

Experts feel the deleveraging process seems to be on a fast track and huge digital opportunities going ahead will take Jio to new scale in terms of business as well as valuations.  &amp;quot;Firstly from value of $50 billion that Facebook had given to now new deal at a premium to even the Facebook deal, 12.5 percent premium, suggested a value of $63-64 billion for Jio Platforms. So at the current level itself there is a scope for higher valuations,&amp;quot; Jal Irani, Senior Vice-President - Wholesale Capital Markets at Edelweiss Financial Services told CNBC-TV18.  &amp;quot;Potential for growth tends to be extremely significant and it is how Reliance will execute this growth which will drive value going forward,&amp;quot; he said.  Siddhartha Khemka, VP - Head of Research (Retail) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services also told Moneycontrol that it is definitely a positive deal with global private equity firms which generally invest for 4-5 years and they are big tech PE firms with large business sense and ideas.  &amp;quot;Net-net the money will be good for their capex and growth plans. With long term support from such PE investors, they can get more ideas from global companies where they invest globally, which will ultimately help Reliance to scale up business very fast in coming years,&amp;quot; he said.  Follow all of our coverage on Jio-Vista Equity Partners deal&nbsp;here  This investment values Jio Platforms at an equity value of Rs 4.91 lakh crore and an enterprise value of Rs 5.16 lakh crore, company in its BSE filing said, adding Vista's investment will translate into a 2.32 percent equity stake in Jio Platforms on a fully diluted basis, making Vista the largest investor in Jio Platforms behind Reliance Industries and Facebook.  &amp;quot;I already said they will be monetising total 15 percent stake, of which they already completed 13.47 percent stake sale (to Facebook, Silver Lake and Vista Equity Partners) and the rest around 1.5 percent will give them additional Rs 7,500 crore. And another 10 percent stake will be retained for IPO which may be likely by March 2021. So Reliance Industries eventually will be wanting to keep 70-75 percent stake of Jio Platforms with themselves,&amp;quot; SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com told CNBC-TV18.  He said so net around Rs 68,000 crore will come in Jio Platforms, and Rs 54,000 crore of rights issue, making total of around Rs 1.22 lakh crore, while the net debt as of March 31, 2020 is Rs 1.61 lakh crore. They are still short of around Rs 40,000 crore which the company needs to garner.  &amp;quot;If I add FY21 cashflow of RIL on standalone basis that gives me around Rs 25,000 crore. Then also there is still a shortage of around Rs 20,000 crore,&amp;quot; he added.  He said Jio Platforms also has debt of Rs 25,000 crore and they would be requiring capex of Rs 30,000-50,000 crore on annual basis as they may be upgrading their technology to 5G.  Hence, Tulsian said eventually the market would be looking that Saudi Aramco deal has to happen. &amp;quot;Originally it was envisaged to be happening at $75 on EV valuation of O2C business. Now I am expecting that to be around $60 a barrel. Even if I take 20 percent dilution of stake that gives me around $12 billion dollars or Rs 90,000 crore.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;So we have about Rs 54,000 crore from rights issue, Rs 90,000 crore from Saudi Aramco deal and Rs 25,000 crore of cash flow FY21 from RIL standalone that makes the perfect equation,&amp;quot; he said.  Siddhartha Khemka feels if debt comes down, the debt rating will improve which will help the company to reduce the cost of debt and as a result overall debt cost of Reliance Industries will also come down.  According to him, Reliance Jio IPO is unlikely before at least next three years given the investment by these PE firms. &amp;quot;Jio Platforms is doing very well and if they continue with small stake sale with global investors then they might not need to do Jio IPO also in future.&amp;quot;  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment expert on Moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

",,"Business, Market news, Moodys, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/rights-issue-credit-positive-for-reliance-industries-to-resultdebt-reduction-moody39s_13736361.html,"Moody's Investors Service on Monday said Reliance Industries' Rs 53,100 crore rights issue is credit positive as earnings will decline because of economic shutdowns. Last week, Reliance announced it will raise Rs 53,100 crore through a rights equity offering.  Also, the company announced an investment of Rs 5,656 crore by Silver Late in Jio Platforms, the digital services business of RIL.  &amp;quot;This is in line with the company's target to reduce its net debt to zero by March 31, 2021. The proceeds from the rights issue will reduce RIL's net debt by about $7.8 billion and is credit positive,&amp;quot; Moody's said in a note.  Along with the previously announced asset sales to Facebook, Inc and BP Plc, RIL expects to generate net proceeds of Rs 1.1 lakh crore, which will reduce its net debt by the same amount.  &amp;quot;The total net debt reduction from completion of these transactions will lower RIL's reported net debt, which was Rs 1.6 lakh crore ($21.4 billion) as on March 31, 2020, by about 68 per cent and will be equivalent to 1.1x its reported EBITDA of Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020,&amp;quot; it said.  In addition, RIL also announced that it has started the process to carve out its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business as a separate subsidiary in order to facilitate the previously announced 20 per cent stake sale in that business to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco).  Despite the coronavirus outbreak and lower oil prices, RIL confirmed that the due diligence process for the transaction is ongoing.  &amp;quot;This increases the likelihood of the transaction going ahead as announced in August 2019,&amp;quot; the rating agency said, adding the transaction with Saudi Aramco values the O2C business at $75 billion and can potentially result in $12-15 billion of cash proceeds for RIL, depending on the amount of debt at the O2C business after the reorganization.  Reliance last week approved the biggest-ever rights issue of Rs 53,100 crore at Rs 1,257 per share.  The company had reported a 10.5 per cent increase in its reported EBITDA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to a year ago.  While the economic shutdowns due to coronavirus outbreak resulted in a decline in earnings from RIL's O2C and retail businesses for the quarter ended March 2020, its earnings from its digital services continued to grow.  &amp;quot;We expect the earnings from its O2C and retail business to see a steeper decline in the quarter ending June 2020 as India's economy is scheduled to be under shutdown for at least 45 days in this quarter. An earnings recovery for these segments will depend on the timing of resumption of economic activity, which remains uncertain at this stage,&amp;quot; it said.  Assuming the economic activity to resume by middle to end of May 2020, the rating agency expected RIL's consolidated EBITDA to decline 10-12 per cent in FY2021 as compared to FY2020. However, the EBITDA is expected to return to FY2020 levels in FY2022 as improved demand in combination with low oil prices will result in higher earnings for the O2C segment, while the earnings growth for retail will resume.  &amp;quot;RIL's recent foray into online retail through its partnership with Whatsapp and Facebook could result in a further boost in its retail earnings, which is currently not factored in our projections,&amp;quot; Moody's said.

Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), had in August last year set a target of March 2021 to make the oil-to-telecom conglomerate net debt-free. But thanks to a $5.7 billion (Rs 43,547 crore) deal with Facebook, a Rs 53,125 crore rights issue and more stake sale to companies such as Saudi Aramco, the target is likely to be achieved by December.  In an investor and media call post announcement of the company's fourth-quarter earnings, RIL's Joint Chief Financial Officer Srikanth Venkatachari said, &amp;quot;The zero net debt target will be achieved within the 2020 calendar year.&amp;quot;  Since the August announcement, Ambani has sold a 9.99 per cent stake in the digital platform that houses India's youngest but biggest mobile operator to Facebook, decided to hive out Reliance's oil and petrochemicals business into a separate entity to help a proposed stake sale to Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco), and pledged to make up for any shortfall in the rights issue.  The company expects to complete a capital raising programme totalling Rs 1.04 lakh crore by June, Venkatachari said.  This includes the rights offering of one share for every 15 shares held at Rs 1,257, a 14 per cent discount to the closing price for April 30. Also included is the Rs 43,574 crore coming from the Facebook buying stake in Jio Platforms and Rs 7,000 crore from sale of 49 per cent stake in fuel retailing venture to UK's BP plc.  &amp;quot;In addition, Saudi Aramco due diligence is progressing well,&amp;quot; he said without saying when the deal was expected to be closed.  Reliance values its oil-to-chemical business, which includes its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, petrochemical assets, and 51 per cent stake in auto fuel and aviation fuel retailing venture, at $75 billion. Saudi Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in this venture.  Alongside announcing the zero net debt target, Ambani, 63, had in August also announced the potential sale of 20 per cent interest in the oil-to-chemical business to Aramco by March 2020. That deadline has been missed partly because of differences over the deal structure and partly due to talks stalling following the outbreak of coronavirus and the subsequent nationwide lockdown.  At the end of March quarter, the company had an outstanding debt of Rs 336,294 crore and cash in hand of Rs 175,259 crore. After adjusting cash, the net debt came to Rs 161,035 crore.  Of this debt, Rs 2,62,000 crore is on RIL books and Rs 23,000 crore is with Jio.  At the concall, company officials said Jio Platforms will retain Rs 14,976 crore out of Rs 43,574 crore received from Facebook and use the remaining Rs 28,598 crore to settle the debt.  The Facebook-Jio Platforms deal will close by the end of the current quarter.  Also, the company said it has received interest from new potential global strategic and financial investors in taking a stake of similar size to Facebook's agreement in the Jio Platform.  &amp;quot;In addition to the FB investment, the board was informed that RIL has received strong interest from other strategic and financial investors and is in good shape to announce a similar-sized investment in the coming months,&amp;quot; the company had said in a statement on Thursday.  &amp;quot;With a strong visibility to these equity infusions, the board was informed that RIL is set to achieve net-zero debt status ahead of its own aggressive timeline,&amp;quot; it had said.

Apart from the several firsts and landmarks the $5.7 billion deal has achieved, it is also unparalleled in the impact it will have on&nbsp;stakeholders - from the two partners and shareholders to industry peers and most importantly, the consumers.  First, let's see how the Indian consumer, the focal point of the deal, could benefit.  Imagine a single digital platform that will probably answer each and every need of a customer. Here is a shortened list of what all one could do -  	Calling, messaging and sharing documents 	Booking tickets for movies or IPL 	Buying groceries, shoes, apparel or even jewellery from outlets close to your homes 	Creating and editing videos 	Playing games 	Making payments or transferring money 	Catching up on news  One could go on.  Those who run businesses can add a few more to the list:  	Getting loans 	Filing returns or GST 	Getting tech help for business  And many more.  What's in it for Facebook?  India may be already the biggest market for Facebook (260 million users), WhatsApp (400 million users), and the second largest for Instagram (80 million users).  But Facebook intended to do more, especially after it was forced to shut down Free Basics in 2016.  Now it can use Jio's subscriber base of nearly 400 million users to reach out to customers, businessmen and youngsters! For instance, the moment Facebook&nbsp;launches its short-form video app Lasso on Jio's platform it will immediately become bigger than TikTok, the Chinese app that is immensely popular in India.  TikTok currently has about 200 million users in India.  Facebook will bank on this investment, which at&nbsp;$5.7 billion is the highest the American multinational has invested outside its home market,&nbsp;to drive its future growth in India.  By the way, it's also the highest any firm has paid for a minority stake in a technology company, anywhere in the world.  Plus-plus for RIL  In hindsight, &nbsp;Chairman Mukesh Ambani had probably set the stage for the deal with Facebook, back in August 2019.  In&nbsp;his speech while addressing the company's 42nd Annual General Meeting on August 12, 2019, Ambani said the company had a &ldquo;very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company by March 31, 2021.&rdquo;  The $5.7 billion investment from the American major is a significant step towards that goal. RIL is also in talks with Saudi Aramco, to sell 20 percent stake in its oil-to-chemicals division.  For Jio, the deal is a leap over its peers, including Bharti Airtel. The RIL arm will now have the opportunity to slew up several deals with Facebook that will be exclusive to Jio subscribers.  Significant takeaways for shareholders  For investors badgered by the COVID-19 crisis, the deal comes like a breath of fresh air.  RIL stock was up 8 percent in early trades, on April 22.  Its shareholders are already delighted by the benefits the deal brings. The learnings from Facebook will be significant as RIL evolves from a commodity-led company to one that deals with data, clearly the new oil.  The shareholders will be equally delighted by the prospects of Jio, and its possible IPO. The deal values Jio at&nbsp;Rs 4.62 lakh crore, catapulting it to the top five leagues in market cap. Jio is no longer just a telecom company, but a technology major.  A leg up for Indian economy&nbsp;  Facebook's investment is a significant vote for RIL, and also a vindication of the potential that the Indian economy still holds. The $5.7 billion investment is its bet on the domestic market.  COVID-19 may have added to the sluggishness that was already there in the domestic economy, and downward revisions in GDP forecasts have further dimmed sentiments.  The deal, apart from being the first piece of good news for Indian business in a while, underlines the potential the Indian market holds, especially once the COVID-19 cloud clears.

Following the announcement, Jal Irani of Edelweiss Securities assigned sum-of-the-parts enterprise value of $40.5 billion to Jio citing Whatsapp and JioMart's formidable partnership. However, he believes that the deal is overvalued and has an outperformance call on RIL.  Read all Facebook-Jio deal-related news here.  Since its launch in late 2016, the company&nbsp;has become India's top telecom operator amassing a user base of 370 million&nbsp;through a barrage of innovations, including offering cut-throat mobile internet prices and a diverse suite of products and including chat services, movies, games and music.  In its bid to make the telecom company net-debt free by 2020, RIL in October 2019 set up Jio Platforms to house all its digital assets including Jio. The new wholly-owned subsidiary absorbed RIL's&nbsp;equity investment of Rs 65,000 crore in Jio.  While the move did not alter RIL&rsquo;s consolidated debt position, it helped deleverage the digital platforms and telecom services business, priming it for a potential stake sale.  &amp;quot;Given the reach and scale of our digital ecosystem, we have received strong interest from potential strategic partners,&amp;quot; Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said at the announcement of Jio Platform. &amp;quot;We will induct the right partners in our Platform Company, creating and unlocking meaningful value for RIL shareholders.&amp;quot;  Also Read:&nbsp;Reliance Jio-Facebook: Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s RIL one step closer to zero-debt plan  Following the announcement in October 2019, global brokerage house Jefferies assigned an&nbsp;enterprise value of $65 billion-$70 billion to Jio Platforms,&nbsp;the most valued in the world in terms of EV/Ebitda after Amazon, according to a report in Fortune India.  The report in November pegged&nbsp;RIL&rsquo;s EV/Ebitda at 22.6 (assuming a valuation of $65 billion-$70 billion).

Meanwhile, CLSA assigned a sum-of-the-parts enterprise value of $45 billion to Jio at that time.  &amp;quot;In most valuations used by the Street, including ours, Jio is valued mainly as a telecom service provider with no value ascribed for Jio&rsquo;s suite of apps, digital investments and capabilities like AI, IoT etc. This exercise aims to correct that positioning. Indeed, some of Jio's apps like TV, music and cinema are among the best in their respective categories,&amp;quot; the CLSA report stated.

The issue, which had hit the market Thursday, has been mostly subscribed by State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, the source added.  The company was planning to mop up Rs 9,000 crore in two tranches of Rs 4,500 crore each in with a fixed rate and floating rate coupons of 7.20 percent.  It can be noted that RIL is the most-cash rich company as also one of the most indebted corporates sitting on debt pile of over Rs 1.54 lakh crore as of March 2020.  According to an exchange filing, RIL would use the proceeds from the NCD sale to repay existing rupee loans and would be issued through a private placement of consisting of 30,000 unsecured redeemable fixed coupon, non-convertible debentures under the PPD (privately placed debentures) series K1.

Earlier this week the RBI however, restricted single company exposure to 10 percent of the raised amount - which means say if SBI has mopped Rs 10,000 crore through this route it can invest only Rs 1,000 crore of this in the RIL issue.  According to media reports, the TLTRO window is being tapped by HDFC, PowerGrid, NHB and also Hudco.  The Reserve Bank announced the TLTRO at lower yields to be parked in the secondary market and invest in primary issues as part of its initiatives to help borrowers cope with the economic damage inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Earlier in the day on Friday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that it has been decided to conduct targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO 2.0) for an aggregate amount of Rs 50,000 crore, to begin with, in tranches of appropriate sizes.

",,"Business, Morgan Stanley, Reliance Industries Ltd",https://www.moneycontrol.com//news/business/ril39s-net-debt-to-fall-despite-struggling-energy-retail-demanddelayasset-sales_13654301.html,"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd's net debt will fall even if energy and retail demand struggles for six months and the planned asset sales are delayed, analysts said. Also, RIL can re-prioritise investment, potentially slowing capex by up to a third. Beyond COVID-19, RIL emerges stronger as competitors face high debt challenges and slow investments, Morgan Stanley said in a research report.  With the outbreak of coronavirus impacting economies globally, RIL faces multiple challenges -- oil prices have declined along with a fall in global oil product demand as a result of the lockdown across India and multiple geographies, potential slowdown in fashion/electronics demand for its retail segment, slower monetisation of telecom investments, and still relatively high debt post the investment cycle.  Consequently, RIL's share price has dropped 21 per cent year-to-date, but still out-performed the market by 7 percentage points.  Morgan Stanley said the timing of normalisation is unclear, and every month of these challenges negatively affects RIL sales volumes across all its businesses.  But competition is struggling even more, and cyclical businesses could get more medium-term tailwinds as capacity growth globally slows.  Morgan Stanley said the decline in global energy demand and expansion in credit default swap (CDS) spreads for RIL, to 290 bps over the past month, have raised investor questions about the company's balance sheet leverage. &amp;quot;Per our assessment, RIL's net debt (including other liabilities) would remain stable in FY21, if the COVID-19 situation were to persist for six months and recover only slowly thereafter.&amp;quot;  RIL, it said, has the flexibility to prioritise its investments in FY21, and could thereby reduce cash outlay by 25-30 per cent. Still, capex on ongoing upstream gas production, telecom spectrum renewal, and maintenance may be required.  Stating that RIL's net debt might not rise in 2020-21, Morgan Stanley said its analysis suggests limited liquidity challenges even if the company's utilisation rates and margins remain challenges in its cash cow energy business.  Also, about half of RIL's debt and liabilities are largely&nbsp;USD funded, hedged via its dollar-linked energy cashflows. However, RIL could raise debt, as some of its creditor liabilities fall due or for refinancing.  &amp;quot;We expect Reliance to gain market share with better profitability as the current demand decline is driving global refiners and oil majors alike to reassess growth plans to conserve cash. This provides a significant headstart for RIL, which has expanded and upscaled its capabilities over the past five years and now is among the top quartile on the cost curve,&amp;quot; it said adding oversupplied oil markets as chemical/ refinery markets tighten are a significant tailwind, as well.  Its strong energy backed cash-flows should help gain market share faster in offline retail and telecom segments, as competition conserves cash, it added. &amp;quot;RIL's net debt will fall even if energy and retail demand struggles for six months and asset sales are delayed.&amp;quot;  RIL has consolidated net debt and liabilities of $46.2 billion and an annual pre-tax profit of $13.6 billion.  The company has previously announced plans to monetise many of its assets, including holdings in energy, telecom, and content businesses. These plans, if executed, could lower debt by about $39 billion, but would also lower earnings by 16 per cent.  Saudi Aramco is&nbsp;still conducting due diligence on a potential investment in RIL's oil-to-chemicals operation.

Jio will also provide Basic JioFiber broadband connectivity (10 Mbps), wherever it is geographically feasible, without any service charges, for this period. it will also provide home gateway routers with a minimum refundable deposit. Meanwhile, for all existing JioFiber subscribers, the telco will provide double data across all plans.  Emergency Service vehicles will be able to avail free fuel being offered by Reliance, while all736 grocery stores of Reliance Retail across the country will ensure sufficient supply of essentials, including staples, fruits and vegetables, bread, breakfast cereals and other items of daily use, so that citizens need not stock up.  To ensure that all employees of the company are safe and protected through the ongoing crisis, RIL will continue to pay contract and temporary workers, even if work has halted due to this crisis.  For those earning below Rs 30,000 per month, salaries will be paid twice a month to protect their cash flow and mitigate any overwhelming financial burden. The company has moved most of its employees to its Work-From-Home platform except for those who are manning critical roles in maintaining the Jio network for nearly 40 crore customers and for providing an uninterrupted supply of fuel, grocery and other essential items of daily consumption.

The domestic market witnessed severe selling for the fourth consecutive week, with the benchmark indices losing more than 15 percent.  Nifty closed near the 10,000-mark last week and has now breached the 8,000 level with ease.  At this juncture, it is trading with a cut of around 17 percent, while the Nifty Bank index has lost around 20 percent from the previous week to settle near the 20,000-mark.  At present, the technical supports are not working since the fall has more to do with the overall sentiment.  Earlier, we expected the 9,500&ndash;9,000 zone to attract some buying but that possibility has been ruled out as Nifty has breached the 8,000-mark.  Currently, the index is hovering near 8,000 level, which is the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the entire rally from 6,826 to 12,430.  Further, there is a major hidden divergence in the monthly RSI of the Nifty index, and this will not be negated if 6,825 remains intact during this month.  Also, the momentum oscillators on all the timeframes are showing signs of exhaustion. Thus, the above-mentioned evidence indicates that the range of 8,000&ndash;7000 can be a place where the market is likely to bottom out.  With regard to the intermediate levels, 7,800 followed by 7,500 could be the next supports. On the other hand, in case of any recovery, 8,600 would be the first hurdle above which there could be strong bounce towards the 10,000-mark since the fall also was vertical.  Traders are advised to start picking quality Nifty50 stocks and deploy some of their capital in the range of 8,000&ndash;7,000.  Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:  Reliance Industries (RIL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 917.70 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Stop loss: Rs 760 | Upside: 20%  During the recent fall, Reliance Industries has corrected more than 40 percent from the peak of Rs 1,600 to end near Rs 900 mark.  At present, the stock is approaching its 100-month exponential moving average, which is placed at Rs 800 and the stock has never breached this level convincingly since 1998.  This time, too, we feel that even in the worst-case scenario, Rs 800 could be the zone, which the bulls will try to protect.  Traders are advised to buy the stock on dip from Rs 900 to Rs 840 for the target of Rs 1,100 with a stop loss of Rs 760.  Tata Steel | Buy | CMP: Rs 272 | Target: Rs 330 | Stop loss: Rs 240 | Upside: 21.32%  During the ongoing crash, the Nifty Metal index has been one of the worst performers and has corrected almost 37 percent from a peak of 2,900.  Currently, the index is trading near the lower end of a falling channel, which it has been respecting since January 2018.  Being a high weightage candidate in the Nifty Metal index, Tata Steel also has a similar price structure and is trading very close to the lower end of the falling channel.  In addition, we are witnessing a positive divergence in the weekly and monthly chart of the stock which indicates the possibility of a bounce.  Traders are advised to buy the stock on a dip near Rs 270 for the target of Rs 330 with a stop loss of Rs 240.  Tata Motors | Buy | LTP: Rs 72.90 | Target: Rs 84 | Stop loss: Rs 63 | Upside: 15.22%  Since the beginning of the year, Tata Motors has crashed around 65 percent from its peak of Rs 202 to reach Rs 70-mark.  The stock has been trading in a highly oversold zone for several weeks.  At present, it is hovering near Rs 68 level, which is the potential reversal zone of the bullish AB=CD pattern formed by joining the swing highs and lows of Rs 240, Rs 106 and Rs 202.  The risk-reward ratio looks highly lucrative to go long for short-term traders.  Traders are advised to buy the stock on a dip near Rs 70 for the target of Rs 84 with a stop loss of Rs 63.

Such a step by Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex, and Nayara - part owned by Russian oil major Rosneft - would severely curtail purchases by one of Venezuela's last big export destinations. India accounted for about a third of Venezuela's oil shipments in January.  The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump warned in New Delhi this week of an increase in sanctions in a bid to oust Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.  Washington last year imposed tough sanctions on PDVSA that cut off Venezuela from the United States, its biggest customer, and severely curbed trading with other major buyers of its oil, the nation's main export. Venezuela's once-strong petroleum industry has withered amid a years-long economic crisis.  After several months with little action, the White House this month added Rosneft Trading SA, the Geneva-based unit Rosneft, to its list of sanctioned companies over accusations that it hid the country of origin of oil cargoes loaded at Venezuelan ports and later resold in Asia.  The U.S. set a May 20 deadline for companies to wind down purchases from Rosneft.  Reliance, a long-time customer of PDVSA, has so far not placed requests for April cargoes, one of the sources said.  Nayara Energy, partially owned by Rosneft, is planning to stop processing Venezuelan oil at its refineries after receiving two cargoes that are scheduled for loading in March, two of the sources said.  It will lift no shipments of Venezuelan crude in April &amp;quot;since RTSA (Rosneft Trading SA) was doing all that business and no one else will pick it up,&amp;quot; one of the sources said, given shipping times.  PDVSA and Reliance did not reply to requests for comment. Nayara said it is in compliance with all relevant and applicable U.S. sanctions. &amp;quot;We reaffirm our commitment to this position following the recent announcements&amp;quot;, it said in an email to Reuters. Rosneft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  FRESH SANCTION WORRIES  The caution over shipments comes as the United States steps up its pressure campaign action against PDVSA.  Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and Nayara have major operational and financial exposure in the United States.  Past sanctions have prompted firms, particularly U.S. financial institutions, to overcomply because they are unwilling to risk approving operations linked to PDVSA.  Currently, a small group of oil firms including U.S. major Chevron, Italy's Eni and Spain's Repsol are authorized by the U.S. Treasury Department to take Venezuelan crude as payment for overdue dividends and loans.  Reliance is about to receive about 2.9 million barrels of Venezuelan crude from Chevron and Eni, loaded in January, Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data and PDVSA documents showed.  But using intermediaries for sourcing Venezuelan oil may only be a short-term solution as Washington mulls new sanctions.  U.S. special envoy Elliott Abrams, who has accused oil and shipping firms of transferring Venezuelan oil at sea to disguise its real country of origin, told Reuters this week that firms previously authorized to maintain trade operations with PDVSA could not be allowed to do so anymore.  Rosneft has harshly criticized U.S. sanctions, saying that the oil received does not generate cash for PDVSA - the main purpose of the sanctions - but is paying back loans. It has also accused the Trump administration of discriminatory treatment.  NO LAST MINUTE DEALS  Last year, Reliance and PDVSA agreed to a crude-for-fuel swap that would send 4 million barrels of Venezuelan crude to Reliance monthly in exchange for diesel cargoes, according to sources at PDVSA and India.  PDVSA in February allocated 3.9 million barrels of crude to Reliance in three cargoes bound for Sikka port, and 3.8 million barrels for Nayara through Rosneft Trading. Similar volumes are expected for March, according to PDSVA's export programs, seen by Reuters. However, no oil has been ordered for April, one source said.  At the same time, it would be difficult for Indian refiners to ramp up purchases ahead of the wind-down deadline as incremental purchases could be seen as a new contract by the United States, which is forbidden under the sanctions, one of the industry sources said."

The government had sought USD 3.5 billion in dues from Reliance and Shell-owned BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Ltd based on an October 2016 partial award of an international arbitration tribunal over the recovery of certain costs from the sale of oil and gas produced from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields.  The two firms had gone to the English High Court against the 2016 partial award.  Sources with direct knowledge of the development said the English High Court had previously directed the tribunal to reconsider certain issues. The tribunal subsequently in 2018 issued another award to uphold the two companies right to recover costs.  This award was challenged by the government.  Justice Robin Knowles of the English High Court (EHC) delivered a judgement on February 12 rejecting all of Government of India's five challenges to the 2018 award, sources said.  When contacted, Reliance declined to comment on the issue.  The government had used the 2016 partial award not just to raise a USD 3.5 billion demand on Reliance and Shell but also sought to block Reliance's USD 15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco on grounds that the company owed money to it.  Reliance and Shell had countered the government petition in the Delhi High Court saying ?the petition is an abuse of process as no arbitration award has fixed any final liability of dues on the company. ?  Sources said the Arbitration Tribunal adjudicating disputes under the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) between BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production India Ltd (Shell) and Reliance with Government of India issued Final Partial Award on October 12, 2016. Parts of the 2016 Award were challenged by the two firms the EHC, and the EHC directed the Arbitration Tribunal to reconsider certain issues.  Arbitration Tribunal reconsidered the issues and on October 1, 2018, gave its Final Partial Award holding that certain costs incurred by two companies were agreed to be cost recoverable by the Government of India.  Government of India challenged the 2018 Award on five issues. The two companies also filed a challenge on one issue that certain costs which Arbitration Tribunal held not be recoverable.  The English court has scheduled a Consequential hearing on February 28, 2020, for issuing further directions in the matter, they said.  Shell and Reliance had previously contended that the tribunal's 2016 award determined certain issues of principles. Pending determination of all issues before it, appropriately, it did not award any monetary sums. Quantification of amounts, if any, by the tribunal is to be done when all issues have been decided.  Certain parts of the 2016 award were challenged by the two companies before an English court wherein it decided some parts of challenge in favour of them and directed the arbitration tribunal to reconsider those parts of the 2016 award. The tribunal, having reconsidered, issued another partial award in December 2018 which was in favour of the two firms.  While this challenge was pending in the English court, the government unilaterally calculated certain amounts, based upon its interpretation of the 2016 award, which the government alleges are payable by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), BG and RIL.

The White House imposed sanctions early last year on state-run oil company PDVSA as part of efforts to oust President Nicolas Maduro. The socialist president remains in power despite deep unpopularity and a years-long economic crisis.  Venezuelan exports declined sharply in early 2019, but have since ticked back up to roughly 1 million bpd, as several oil companies resumed marketing or buying the country's oil.  The White House has yet to enforce secondary sanctions announced in August aimed at non-U.S. companies buying Venezuelan oil.  The White House on Wednesday warned several oil companies, including Reliance, Russia's Rosneft , Spain's Repsol and Chevron, to tread cautiously in their activities in Venezuela, in an attempt to ramp up pressure on Maduro.  The suggestion of retaliation surprised those companies, according to executives from joint ventures with state-run PDVSA.  A Reliance spokesperson told Reuters that the refining firm is &amp;quot;in frequent communications with U.S. government officials regarding Venezuela and continuously keep them apprised of our actions.&amp;quot;  Maduro's re-election in 2018 was viewed as a sham by most Western Hemisphere nations. The White House on Wednesday hosted opposition leader Juan Guaido, whom Maduro refers to as a puppet of the United States, even as dozens of nations recognize him as the rightful president.  MORE SANCTIONS PROMISED  On Thursday, Elliot Abrams, the top U.S. envoy for Venezuela, declined to discuss Washington's conversations with Rosneft, but promised more sanctions overall. &amp;quot;We see that sanctions have had and are having significant impact and sanctions will increase,&amp;quot; he said, without elaborating.  Abrams said Moscow may soon find that its support for Maduro &amp;quot;will no longer be cost-free.&amp;quot;  Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday criticized U.S. sanctions policy in a press conference in Mexico City, adding that interference could make things worse in Venezuela. &amp;quot;The U.S. believes it is allowed to do anything and meanwhile threatens interlocutors with punishments and sanctions,&amp;quot; Lavrov said.  Prior to sanctions, Venezuela exported roughly 1.5 million barrels of crude and processed fuels per day. The sanctions cut off Venezuela's top purchaser, the United States.  The White House announced secondary sanctions in August targeting non-U.S. companies buying Venezuelan oil, but its pressure campaign waned in the second half of 2019, and companies interpreted the announcement differently.  COMPANIES NOTE COMPLIANCE  Reliance, among PDVSA's largest customers, in October resumed direct purchases of Venezuelan crude after a four-month pause, helping the state-run company reduce mounting inventories of unsold oil. Reliance said at that time that it was supplying PDVSA with fuel permitted under sanctions in exchange for the Venezuelan oil.  Reliance's representative added that the company does not operate as an intermediary for sales of Venezuelan oil to third parties. &amp;quot;All Venezuelan crude sourced by Reliance is for processing in Reliance's refineries only.&amp;quot;  Chevron resumed marketing of Venezuelan oil in October for the first time since sanctions were imposed, in tankers bound for Asian destinations, according to PDVSA records and Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data.  &amp;quot;We remain focused on our base business operations, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,&amp;quot; said Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, adding that crude marketing is permitted under a license by the U.S. Treasury to pay for expenses related to the maintenance of operations.  Chevron said that shipments of Venezuelan crude taken by the company represented about 2 percent of the country's total exports in 2019. &amp;quot;If Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela, non-U.S. companies will fill the void and oil production will continue,&amp;quot; it added.  Repsol declined to comment. Rosneft and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  China's state-run CNPC suspended loadings of Venezuelan crude at PDVSA's ports last year. It has not resumed them after Washington pressured Chinese energy companies to halt trade with PDVSA.  The U.S. administration has issued waivers for U.S. service firms and some of PDVSA's joint venture partners to continue operating in the South American nation. The permits are not specific about trade transactions with Venezuelan oil.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

Reliance, whose twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat were major importers of Venezuelan crude oil, had last year reportedly slashed purchases from the Latin American country by about a third.  The US imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela in late January 2019 with a view to curb the country's crude exports and put pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down.  &amp;quot;Reliance is not sharing any oil field in Venezuela nor does it operate as an intermediary for sale to third parties,&amp;quot; the statement said. &amp;quot;All Venezuelan crude oil sourced by Reliance is for processing in Reliance's refineries only.&amp;quot;  The company said it &amp;quot;will always remain in compliance with US sanctions policies affecting Venezuela.&amp;quot;  Reliance had in March last year stated that it had stopped all oil exports to Venezuela and will not resume sales until sanctions are lifted.  The company has investments in US shale gas projects and trades fuel in North America.  US oil sanctions on Venezuela do not ban importing crude oil from the Latin American nation but bar exports from the US of the diluents that must be blended with the extra-heavy oil from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt so it can flow through pipelines.  Industry sources said Reliance had a contract to buy some 3 million barrels of crude oil from Venezuela a month, which was reduced to about 2 million barrels last year.  Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA has been placed on the US Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals list, which generally prohibits American citizens from dealing with named firms or individuals.  This has resulted in international banks and shipping companies as well as Reliance ceasing any transactions with the firm.  These restrictions came into force on March 29, 2019 after an eight week winding down period for contracts that were already in effect.  Oil from the Orinoco Belt needs to be diluted with lighter grades to reduce its viscosity so as to allow its flow through pipelines to the coast for export or processing.

In a late evening statement, Reliance-BP confirmed that it has completed the safe cessation of production in a planned manner from D1/D3 field.  &amp;quot;The RIL-BP joint venture has successfully worked to extend the life of production from the D1/D3 Field which otherwise would have ceased production in 2015 due to issues of reservoir pressure and water ingress. Through innovation and application of 'first-of-their-kind solutions, the field's life was extended for almost five years, to February 2020, maximizing the recovery from the field,&amp;quot; it said.  The first-gas from new fields in the block is expected in mid-2020, it added.  D1/D3 field, in Block KG D6 (KG-DWN-98/3) located in the Bay of Bengal, was India's first deepwater gas field to be put on production in April 2009. Output, which peaked at over 61 million standard cubic meters per day in 2010, had been on a decline as sand and water ingress forced wells to shut down one after the other.  While at the peak, it was India's biggest gas field, in the last quarter D1/D3 produced an average of just 1.5 mmscmd.  Sources said only three out of the 18 wells drilled on the fields had remained on production and they too died on Monday.  In perhaps one of its kind intervention in a deepsea field, Reliance-BP through use of a combination of complex techniques kept the wells flowing at Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&amp;amp;amp;D3) fields for the last four years.  Reliance had to date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to began production in September 2008. D1 and D3 fields went onstream in April 2009.  MA field cessation expected by September 2018, the sources said, adding the field at its peak had produced 1,08,418 tonnes of oil in May 2010.  MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 mmscmd in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of well after well. D1 &amp;amp;amp; D3 field too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd.  KG-D6 produced about 3 trillion cubic feet equivalent, saving about USD 30 billion in energy imports.  The sources said the field infrastructure would be utilized to bring on stream the next set of fields in the block.  The joint venture has committed USD 5 billion (Rs 35,000 crores) of investments towards monetizing another 3 trillion cubic feet equivalent (about 500 Million Barrels of Oil equivalent) reserves from three projects - R cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields.  These projects will be utilizing most of the existing gas production facilities, they said, adding once commissioned, the three fields will deliver a peak production of 1 billion cubic feet per day, which is about 20 per cent of the current domestic production.  Although there were initial setbacks due to geological surprises, the challenge was to extend life of the field beyond 2015 due to lower reservoir pressure and water ingress, the sources said.  Reliance-BP innovated and applied first of their kind solutions to extend field life and maximize recovery, which included sidetrack/substitute wells, reduction of arrival pressures, and mitigating the effect of water in the network.  This effort extended production up till this month.  The sources said despite best efforts, in recent times the field instability exacerbated due to water and sand ingress leading to a sharp decline in production. Consequently, to preserve the facilities for future use, the field had to be safely shutdown on Monday.  The field set several global benchmarks set in terms of deepwater operational performance - 99.9 per cent uptime, 100 per cent incident-free operations and no security incident.  Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 66.6 per cent stake, while BP has the balance.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is urging India to end consumption of single-use plastics by 2022.  But Indians should focus on fighting pollution, not plastics, executives at Reliance, whose chairman is Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, said during a launch event on Tuesday.  The company will seek to work with India's highway authority and individual states to potentially supply a plastics-infused mix to make some of the thousands of kilometres of roads Modi wants to build to upgrade India's creaking infrastructure.  Light plastics, the type used as carry bags or snack wrappers, are typically not viable to recycle and so end up in landfills, street corners or oceans. Reliance wants to shred these plastics and mix them with bitumen, a formula the conglomerate says is cheaper and longer-lasting.  &amp;quot;(This) can be a game-changing project both for our environment and our roads,&amp;quot; Vipul Shah, the COO of the petrochemicals business, said at a company petchem plant in the western state of Maharashtra.  Shah was coy on details, saying Reliance had yet to work out the financial fine print in what he stressed would be a philanthropic endeavour.  Reliance's announcement comes as campaigners such as Greta Thunberg ramp up pressure on businesses to help tackle climate change.  &amp;quot;It is happening internationally and now has started percolating to India too, though it's at a very early stage,&amp;quot; said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.  &amp;quot;Corporates and industries are a big source of all kinds of pollution in India, so much more serious thoughts, policies and actions are required from them,&amp;quot; he added.  India was home to 15 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world in 2018, according to a study by two groups monitoring air pollution. New Delhi is the world's most polluted capital, with smog causing school cancellations, flight diversions and untold health problems for its over 20 million people.  &ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;"

For the oil-to-telecom conglomerate, energy remains core business and is expected to further expand as India is forecast to be the fastest-growing market for fuel and chemical products over the next decade, it said adding the company's partnership with BP of the UK and Saudi Aramco will support this.  Reliance owns the world's largest single-site oil refining complex and has multiple petrochemical plants. Three years back it forayed into telecom business and has reached 34 per cent share of market revenue.  &amp;quot;Based on the current net add run-rates it will likely reach 44 per cent share by the end of the next financial year,&amp;quot; Bernstein said.  On its retail foray, it said Reliance is the offline leader with $18.5 billion of revenues coming from 11,000-plus stores. &amp;quot;The company is best positioned in New Commerce - digitizing the neighbourhood stores and in e-commerce (grocery/fashion categories).&amp;quot;  Also, fintech is another area in which Reliance is well positioned, it said identifying digitizing the kirana stores to accept digital payments and distributing mutual funds through Jio Money (payment app) as business opportunities.  Stating that media offers unique opportunities and synergies with telco, the analyst said Reliance has the dominant OTT platforms in India with content partnerships with Disney and Viacom.  &amp;quot;With activities spanning oil and gas, telecoms, retail media and fintech, Reliance is one of the most diversified conglomerates in India if not the world. There is simply no other company like it,&amp;quot; Bernstein said. &amp;quot;In India, Reliance dominates energy, telco and retail in the same way that Exxon, AT&amp;amp;amp;T and Amazon does in the US. But rather than three separate companies, Reliance comprises all three of these businesses rolled into one.&amp;quot;  While Exxon is the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas company, AT&amp;amp;amp;T is the world's largest telecommunications firm. Amazon is the world's largest online retailer.  Bernstein said Reliance has been unique in terms of entering new business areas and managing to achieve what the incumbent players and investors would never have thought possible. &amp;quot;This is a testament to Reliance management skills and ability to navigate some of the complexities which come with being a large operator in India.&amp;quot;  While there have some failures, notably oil and gas production along the way, &amp;quot;what has impressed most is the strategic vision and execution ability of Reliance management to enter and 'win' in areas outside of core business,&amp;quot; it said.  Over the past 10 years Reliance has undergone a transformation, which is almost unprecedented in corporate history, it said.  A decade ago 100 per cent of the EBITDA from the business came from energy-related business segments (refining, petrochemicals and E&amp;amp;amp;P). This year FY20, the contribution from energy will fall to 64 per cent. &amp;quot;In two years (FY22), we expect that energy will fall below 50 per cent of the group EBITDA and by FY25, the energy-related business will account for around 30 per cent of group EBITDA,&amp;quot; it said adding by FY23 telco will overtake energy to be the largest EBITDA contributing segment.  As Ambani embraced the new economy, Reliance sold out of the old economy - 30 per cent of upstream to BP in 2011 and an initial agreement with Aramco in 2019 for 20 per cent of the refining and petrochemical business).  The company, it said, could be a case study for other oil majors on how to evolve their business to compete in the low carbon world.

Reliance Retail continued to report stellar growth for the quarter as revenue grew by 27.4 percent YoY (up 10 percent QoQ) to Rs 45,327 crore with accelerated store roll-out and strong LFL sales.  Mukesh Ambani said the company was making good progress on the value unlocking initiatives announced earlier while building on sustainable growth platforms for shareholders.  Kotak Institutional Equities also reiterated its buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,850 as Q3 performance was operationally muted across segments except retail.  Free cash flow turned positive after seven years led by an accelerated decline in capex and company may benefit meaningfully from plausible consolidation in telecom, it said.  While having an overweight call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,753, Morgan Stanley said earnings were 6 percent above its estimate, mainly due to lower tax rate.  &amp;quot;Better refinery utilisation rates were offset high telecom subscriber churn. Retail &amp;amp;amp; chemical businesses had in-line margin trends,&amp;quot; it added.  Credit Suisse, the only brokerage having neutral call with a target at Rs 1,400, said Jio reported lower-than_expected result on ARPU, subscribers &amp;amp;amp; margins, but Jio will become net recipient of access charges from Q4FY20.  Strong margin improvement in retail was due to better mix. Gross refining margin declined QoQ due to lower middle distillate crack and the outlook on refining margin depends on pick-up in demand for marine gas oil, the brokerage said.

It was also supported by lower tax cost and higher other income.  The poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18 had estimated profit at Rs 11,333 crore for the quarter.  Consolidated revenue from operations in Q3 rose 2.5 percent QoQ to Rs 1.57 lakh crore, but the same fell 2.5 percent YoY.  &amp;quot;Decrease in revenue YoY is primarily on account of 10.6 percent decline in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business revenues, with lower product price realization and 6.6 percent fall in Brent crude price. This was partially offset by continuing growth momentum in consumer businesses,&amp;quot; the company said in its BSE filing.  Gross refining margin (GRM) for the quarter came in at $9.2 a barrel, which was in line with the poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18, against $8.8 a barrel in Q3FY19 and $9.4 a barrel in Q2FY20.  Refining margins weakened QoQ on the back of steep declines in fuel oil cracks from the upcoming IMO spec change and lower-middle distillate cracks more than offsetting the gains in light distillate cracks, company said.  RIL maintained significant premium over Singapore complex margins with product yield optimization to take advantage of firm middle distillate cracks and robust risk management, it added.  During Q3FY20, the benchmark Singapore complex margin averaged $1.6 per barrel as compared to $6.5 per barrel in Q2FY20 and $4.3 per barrel in Q3FY19.  Refining business grew by 6.7 percent sequentially (down 7.2 percent YoY) to Rs 1.03 lakh crore, but petrochemical segment reported a 4.2 percent decline QoQ (down 19.1 percent YoY) at Rs 36,909 crore for the quarter due to lower price realizations across product categories.  &amp;quot;The third-quarter results for our energy business reflects the weak global economic environment and volatility in energy markets. Within our O2C chain, downstream petrochemicals profitability was impacted by weak margins across products with subdued demand in well-supplied markets,&amp;quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.  &amp;quot;Refining segment performance improved in a difficult operating environment given our continuous focus on cost positions, high operating rates and product placement,&amp;quot; he added.  Refining segment's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) grew by 14.1 percent quarter-on-quarter (up 11.9 percent YoY) to Rs 5,657 crore and margin increased 40bps QoQ and 100bps YoY to 5.5 percent for Q3FY20.  On the petchem front, EBIT fell sharply by 22.7 percent QoQ (down 28.5 percent YoY) to Rs 5,880 crore and margin contracted to 15.9 percent (from 19.7 percent in Q2FY20 and 18 percent in Q3FY19).  Reliance Jio, the country's largest company by market share and subscriber base, reported a whopping 36.4 percent sequential growth in Q3 profit at Rs 1,350 crore on revenue of Rs 13,968 crore, which grew 6.4 percent QoQ.  The profitability of telecom operator was lower than the poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18 (which was pegged at Rs 1,500 crore). It was impacted by Rs 177 crore on account of AGR dues.  At the operating level, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 8.4 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 5,601 crore and margin expanded by 80bps to 40.1 percent in Q3FY20.  Jio's average revenue per user (ARPU) for the quarter stood at Rs 128.4, higher by 7 percent over Rs 120 in September quarter. It was also ahead of analyst estimates of Rs 124-125.  The telecom operator added 14.8 million subscribers during the quarter against 23.9 million users addition seen in previous quarter, taking its total subscriber base to 370 million at the end of December quarter.  Reliance Retail continued to report stellar growth for the quarter as revenue grew by 27.4 percent YoY (up 10 percent QoQ) to Rs 45,327 crore with accelerated store roll-out and strong LFL sales.  &amp;quot;Revenue growth was led by robust 35.7 percent YoY growth in consumer electronics, fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle and grocery segments,&amp;quot; the company said.  &amp;quot;The company saw consistent same-store sales growth and record footfall across our stores driven by our compelling proposition of great shopping experience and superior value,&amp;quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  Retail's EBIT at Rs 2,389 crore showed a massive 58 percent YoY growth (up 17.4 percent QoQ) and margin grew by 110bps YoY (up 40bps QoQ) to 5.3 percent for the quarter ended December 2019.  Consolidated EBITDA during the quarter increased 1.1 percent to Rs 22,386 crore QoQ and margin contracted 20bps QoQ to 14.6 percent in Q3FY20, but both were ahead of CNBC-TV18 poll which was pegged at Rs 22,313 crore and 14 percent respectively.  Mukesh Ambani said the company was making good progress on the value unlocking initiatives announced earlier while building on sustainable growth platforms for shareholders.  Outstanding debt of the company was Rs 3,06,851 crore at the end of December 2019, compared to Rs 2,87,505 crore as on March 31, 2019.  RIL stock has risen 13.6 percent during the third quarter and has rallied 36 percent in the last year amid asset monetisation news and strong growth in the telecom business.

Overall, consolidated revenue for the quarter could be higher by 2-7 percent sequentially, but profit and operating income may be flat to moderately high as strong telecom and retail segments could be offset by weaker petchem business.  Brokerages expect Q3 gross refining margins (GRM), which are closely watched by the Street, at around $9-10 per barrel against $9.4 a barrel reported in the September quarter, which may support standalone earnings but could be offset by weak petchem margin.  Motilal Oswal expects GRM at around $9 a barrel, with a huge premium of $7.3 a barrel to Singapore GRM, while Kotak Institutional Equities expects the GRM at $10.5 a barrel on the higher side for the quarter.  Singapore GRM averaged at around $1.6-1.7 per barrel for Q3FY19, primarily due to worsening of FO (fuel oil) cracks and failure in revival of diesel cracks. This is the lowest quarterly GRM average in the last 15 years.  For All Earnings Related News - Click Here  In Q3FY20, average Brent prices stood at $62.5 per barrel, marginally higher than the average price of $61.9 a barrel in Q2FY20, resulting in inventory gains for refiners based on their different inventory cycles, Motilal Oswal said.  Kotak Institutional Equities expect standalone EBITDA to increase QoQ led by higher refining margins at $10.5 a barrel and crude throughput, which will be partly offset by sharp moderation in overall petchem margins.  But all eyes will remain on consumer businesses - telecom and retail - as CMD, Mukesh Ambani in the last annual general meeting had said these segments would be key drivers in coming years.  The tariff hike since December and consistent addition of subscribers are expected to support Jio, which could report higher average revenue per user (ARPU) while retail business could continue to surprise with growth.  &amp;quot;Consolidated EBITDA will be further boosted by increase in contribution from (1) Jio (up Rs 900 crore QoQ) amid rising subscriber base and higher ARPUs and (2) retail segment amid sustained growth in revenues,&amp;quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities.  &amp;quot;In the wake of Reliance Jio's discounted offering of Jiophone at a cut-throat Rs 699, we are building in a flat subscriber base for Bharti and a 5.7 million decline in subscriber base for Idea. We expect Jio's revenue to jump 12.6 percent QoQ bolstered by higher Jiophone sales, recovery of IUC charges and price hikes,&amp;quot; said Edelweiss.  The brokerage expects Jio to add 30 million subscribers during the quarter, and a 2.6 percent jump in ARPUs.  For Reliance Retail, the management expects to sustain same-store-sales growth at around 20 percent in FY20. It is currently present in over 7,000 cities and towns.  Key things to watch out for would be commentary on number of subscriber addition due to impact of ARPU changes, closure of Aramco deal as a part of debt reduction strategy and IPO plans for retail business.  The stock gained 13.6 percent during third quarter and rallied 36 percent in last one year amid asset monetisation news and strong growth in telecom business.  While maintaining overweight call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,753 (implying 14 percent potential upside from current levels), Morgan Stanley in its latest report said it has highlighted RIL's valuation versus the market, compared to its earlier cycles of balance sheet leveraging and deleveraging, along with relative valuation versus global peers.  It also highlighted the recent trends in ownership and consensus estimates following last quarter's earnings.  RIL's relative discount to the market is heading towards its historical long-term average on the basis of both P/B and P/E:    RIL's ROCE is at par with the market (ex-financials) returns; ROE underperformance has marginally narrowed:  RIL's valuation versus peers and RoCE through cycles:    Consensus expectations are moving upwards:    Ownership (foreign and domestic institutional holdings) trends:    Disclaimer: The above report is compiled from information available on public platforms.
